    "[r/AmItheAsshole](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/) is a subreddit where people will post a story about some conflict they've had and it is up to the community to judge who the \"asshole\" is in the situation. The page description words this very eloquently:\n",

    "\"A catharsis for the frustrated moral philosopher in all of us, and a place to finally find out if you were wrong in an argument that's been bothering you. Tell us about any non-violent conflict you have experienced; give us both sides of the story, and find out if you're right, or you're the asshole.\" ([r/AmItheAsshole](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/))\n",

My boss is extremely stressed out and asked if I would consider postponing my vacation. He said he would normally never ask this of me, but this was an uniquely crappy situation and he can't handle the project alone. He offered to reimburse me for all nonrefundable costs of the trip.\n",

I think having to cancel the trip is shitty, but I'm worried I'll be out of a job if I say no, and we only have a few months of emergency savings to live off of if that happens.
