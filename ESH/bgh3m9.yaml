selftext: "This happened a couple of days ago and I was really pissed. I'm here because\
  \ I want to know if I'm in the wrong here. \n\nMy wife is going to give birth to\
  \ our twin daughters. I've done everything to support her. I make breakfast everyday\
  \ and I make it a point to make whatever she asks me to make. \n\nYesterday, my\
  \ wife woke me up at 2am and told me that she wanted to eat icecream. We had no\
  \ ice cream left because she ate it all at night. I really wanted to get her the\
  \ ice cream. She told me that she wanted choco chip. I drove for an hour to find\
  \ a place at that time. But they didn't have any choco chip at that time. I didn't\
  \ want to disappoint her, so I got strawberry, her next favourite flavour. \n\n\
  When I got back, I told her that I didn't find choco chip. Idk what happened but\
  \ she started crying and yelling  at me. She threw away the ice cream, called me\
  \ a fucking imbecile and told me I didn't love her. She also told me that she didn't\
  \ want to sleep next to me. I slept in another room. \n\nNow today, she comes to\
  \ me, cries, apologizes and tells me that she was really stressed out. But I did\
  \ not sleep with her at night. I've decided that I don't want to do anything now.\
  \ This is not the first time this has happened. I'm not a fantastic cook. She insists\
  \ that I make something for her, but when I make it she always tells me that it's\
  \ horrible. She later apologizes and tells me that it was wonderful ( all this started\
  \ after the pregnancy ). WIBTA here??"
title: WIBTA if I tell my wife that I will no longer be helping with her pregnancy
  cravings or sleep next to her because she lashed out at me for not finding choco
  chip ice cream at 3am?
