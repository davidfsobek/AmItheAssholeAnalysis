selftext: 'So I have finals this week and, tensions are running high everywhere. I
  was studying in the library with a group of friends for a political science class,
  and my friend complained that this class is incredibly hard and he''s having a tough
  time. This girl who was studying with us heard him and was like "you aren''t a STEM
  major so why are you even complaining? you haven''t had a hard class till you''ve
  taken calc 3." Now I''m not a STEM major either, and I just felt tired of always
  being told my major isn''t hard or anything, especially since she has mentioned
  it several times before, so I told her to shut the fuck up for once. But this led
  to her crying and her friends started telling me I was being mean to her.


  Was I the asshole here?'
