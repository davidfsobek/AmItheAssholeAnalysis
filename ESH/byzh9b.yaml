selftext: 'I just got my first apartment after 10 years of fighting poverty (2 of
  it homeless). So I threw my first party.


  I set it 3 weeks in advance and let everyone know, even made a post on the event
  before the party so everyone would be reminded.


  Well, only 2 people showed up.


  Some people messages me and apologized and gave me a whole slew of reasons  (I was
  tired, busy, something came up, etc) and some have been offering me gifts.  I just
  told them that it''s not about the gift at all and that I don''t want to know who
  they are anymore.


  edit: I''d like to add that I spent 150 dollars on food and drink before the party


  edit2: A lot of people are missing the point. It''s not about people not showing
  up. It''s about people saying that they are going to come and then not coming, without
  letting me know.  People who couldn''t make it, or had to cancel are fine in my
  book. It''s literally just the people ghosting.


  edit3: I''m banned for trolling, which is why I''ve stopped replying.

  I''d like to also thank the people who have sent me kind messages and talked to
  me about it. Even and especially the ones who don''t agree with me, but were still
  kind. You people are diamonds, and deserve everything your heart desires.'
title: AITA I threw an apartment warming party, invited 20 people. 2 showed up. I
  broke off friendships with everyone who said they would show up and just ghosted,
  and have been denying any gifts.
