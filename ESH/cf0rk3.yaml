selftext: "My younger brother Bryan just turned 19 about month ago. About an hour\
  \ ago, he casually mentioned if I could go get this moscotto (wine) that he likes\
  \ because he and his girlfriend is celebrating their first year together. He said\
  \ he needs it by 9 and just expected me to go and get it for him.\n\nI told him\
  \ I\u2019m not really comfortable giving alcohol to someone whose underaged. It\u2019\
  s not like it\u2019s far or anything (just a couple min drive from my house). But\
  \ I live in America, so it\u2019s illegal, and call me a straight edge or whatever\
  \ but I don\u2019t like breaking the law. Additionally, I don\u2019t want to give\
  \ him the impression that this is something that I\u2019m willing to do often; if\
  \ I give him alcohol now, he\u2019d expect me to do it again in the future.\n\n\
  I said he can ask our parents but I\u2019m definitely not going to break the law\
  \ for him. He got pissy and said to \u201Cstop being a bitch, who cares?\u201D I\
  \ said I do, and so I\u2019m not doing it, end of story.\n\nHe texted our parents,\
  \ and they called me. I expected them to take my side so I put them on speaker phone,\
  \ but they said they were planning a date night tonight and told me to handle it.\
  \ I said no and explained why I didn\u2019t want to give my underaged brother alcohol,\
  \ but they said to \u201Cstop being difficult and just give him the damn wine\u201D\
  .\n\nBryan had a shit-eating grin after that and said \u201CI\u2019ll see you before\
  \ 9\u201D. I went to my car so I guess he assumed I was getting it for him, but\
  \ instead I just drove to a friend\u2019s house. I group texted Bryan and our parents,\
  \ and said I wasn\u2019t going to put my livelihood at risk and break the law for\
  \ anyone, and if anyone had a problem with that, well too bad. I then put my phone\
  \ on airplane mode and am currently typing this on my computer.\n\nDid I do the\
  \ right thing? I feel like my brother will be absolutely furious when I turn my\
  \ phone on, but I feel like he\u2019s acting like a little turd. AITA for how I\
  \ handled the situation?\n\nUpdate: turned my phone back on. Mom and dad are furious.\
  \ All Bryan  texted was \"you know, you ruined what was supposed to be a special\
  \ night and I hope it was worth it.\" Starting to question if I did the right thing...\n\
  \nUPDATE 2: Got home last night. Brother wouldn't even look at me. I sent him a\
  \ message saying that it wasn't anything against him or anything; I'm just really\
  \ against the alcohol culture and I felt uncomfortable with the request. All he\
  \ sent back was \"tbh, i don't really give a shit about your excuses, just leave\
  \ me alone\". He won't answer any of my calls or texts anymore. My parents are furious\
  \ for \"being such a square\" and said that between not giving my underaged brother\
  \ alcohol and not being a legal slave (like forcing myself to do the shit they try\
  \ to tell me to do e.g.  plant the garden that THEY want or spread the mulch that\
  \ THEY want), they're genuinely considering kicking me out of the house or forcing\
  \ me to start paying rent..."
