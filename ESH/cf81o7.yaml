selftext: "I (17M) was horrendously bullied by this guy, we can call Jake (17M). Jake\
  \ was quite popular and sociable but for some reason kept targeting me, calling\
  \ me names, slurs, etc. I hated him so much, I'd hate going to school and him being\
  \ in class. I dreaded it.\n\nWell we found out that Jake unexpectedly passed away\
  \ in his sleep. When I saw this on Facebook, I saw lots of RIP posts from classmates,\
  \ but my first reaction was relief. I felt a weight lift off my shoulders.\n\nWhen\
  \ I came to class, people were crying and my teacher (50F) said we need to take\
  \ a moment silence for him. After the silence was done, I just said out loud ''I\
  \ don't care that Jake died. He was a bully''. People looked at me instantly and\
  \ gave me death stares, I could hear some people muttering swear words.\n\nBut then\
  \ some people came up to me and thanked me, they said they hated Jake too. Honestly\
  \ I'm fucking glad he's dead. I feel so much better about my life now. Some classmates\
  \ called me AH, his girlfriend (ex now lol) came up to me and called me every name\
  \ under the sun, AH was one of them. I just said to her ''You need to calm down\
  \ and relax'' and walked away. \n\nI honestly feel good and so do some other classmates.\
  \ AITA?\n\n**Edit - The reason I say 'now ex lol' is because she chose to be in\
  \ a relationship with an awful, awful person. That's bad character judgement on\
  \ her part, and also complacency.**\n\n**Edit 2 - Way too many comments to read....Gonna\
  \ sign off for a bit and read them later. I have had many helpful PM's. Thank you\
  \ to those who reached out.**"
