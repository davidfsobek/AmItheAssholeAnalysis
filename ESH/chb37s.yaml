selftext: "For reference, my brother Connor is 19, I am 26, and my (now ex) fianc\xE9\
  \ Hunter is 28. Also for reference, already mentioned in the title, but my brother\
  \ was kicked out when he was 16 because our parents snooped through his phone and\
  \ found out he was in gay.\n\nConnor had a birthday last weekend, so he invited\
  \ his friends over and they were all (18-22 year olds) drinking and playing games.\
  \ Hunter and I were about to head out to let them have the place to themselves,\
  \ when Connor asked if we wanted to join them. I initially refused (bit too old\
  \ to be playing drinking games), but he insisted and Hunter thought it\u2019d be\
  \ fun to act like college students again.\n\nWe all got pretty drunk and Connor\
  \ had the idea of playing Never Have I Ever. A few rounds in, the statement \u201C\
  Never Have I Ever cheated before\u201D came up.\n\nNow\u2019s a good time to mention\
  \ that Hunter is **staunchly** against cheating. His ex-fianc\xE9 cheated on him\
  \ and it emotionally wrecked him. And unfortunately, as a lot of dumb, immature\
  \ 17 year olds do, I cheated on my \u201Cboyfriend\u201D of 5 months. It was a stupid\
  \ mistake, he found out, and (understandably) ended things. This was almost a decade\
  \ ago, I obviously learned my lesson, and look back at that time with shame (and\
  \ obviously never cheated since).\n\nWell my brother knows about this so when I\
  \ didn\u2019t drink, he went \u201Chey sis, what the hell? You know you cheated\
  \ on (*insert ex\u2019s name*). You have to drink to that!\u201D\n\nMy boyfriend\
  \ paused, looked at me, looked at him, and just walked out of the room. I followed\
  \ him and tried to talk to tell him that it was a stupid teenaged mistake, but he\
  \ wasn\u2019t haven\u2019t any of it and ended things on the spot. I\u2019m numb.\
  \ I\u2019m heartbroken. He was my everything and more and I still don\u2019t know\
  \ how I\u2019m going to move on.\n\nConnor tried to apologize, but I feel nothing\
  \ but sadness and emptiness. This morning I served him an eviction notice. He begged\
  \ me to stay and said he didn\u2019t mean to ruin my relationship and he just didn\u2019\
  t think when he said those words. I just can\u2019t look at him right now. He ruined\
  \ my life. After I raised him and cared for him like he was my own. I feel so hurt.\
  \ Am I being unreasonable?"
title: "AITA for kicking out my brother, who our parents have previously disowned,\
  \ because he told my (now ex) fianc\xE9 that I cheated 9 years ago?"
