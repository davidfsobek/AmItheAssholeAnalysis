selftext: "This line at a Starbucks I went to was really long. I was in line for a\
  \ good maybe 20 minutes. Until this lady in a Mercedes tries to cut in front of\
  \ me and like 8 others behind me. I laid on the horn and tried to block her from\
  \ cutting me but she succeeded anyway and flipped me off. \n\nOkay. I\u2019m the\
  \ type of person who will not let someone get away with shit like this. So I waited\
  \ until she pulls up and as soon as she tries to order, I honk. She then looks at\
  \ me with a dirty look and gives me the finger which I already had a middle finger\
  \ of my own ready for her. Each time she makes an attempt to order something I honk\
  \ and sometimes lay on the horn for 3 seconds. We stopped as soon as she drove off.\
  \ We then ordered and went about our day. \n\nI just can\u2019t people who are extremely\
  \ rude like that lady and I couldn\u2019t simply let this go. \n\nAITA for this?"
