selftext: 'I''m half Japanese and my family recently moved into my stepdad''s house.  I
  speak English with my brothers but Japanese with my mom. At the dinner table, my
  stepdad will get angry if we speak Japanese because he feels left out.  He frequently
  stands up and declares that he is left out and leaves the room to watch TV.


  I have major problems with him as he frequently trash talks my dad and screams at
  us.


  I live in Australia and my mother is the only connection I have with my Japanese
  heritage and being able to speak Japanese is really important to me.


  I don''t feel obligated to speak English around him just because he wants to hear
  what I''m talking to my mom about.


  Edit:  To clarify Japanese is the only language I have ever spoke with my mom and
  it feels incredibly weird speaking English with her. I speak Japanese with her even
  around other people e.g my dad or friends and family.'
