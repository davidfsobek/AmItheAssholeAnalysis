selftext: "Honestly don\u2019t think I acted assholish here given her actions, but\
  \ the severe backlash I\u2019ve received has me open to the idea that I am. Hence\
  \ I\u2019m posting here.\n\nTo cut a long story short, I slept with a girl called\
  \ Madison at a toga party. We had both been drinking but not in anyway drunk. Just\
  \ a couple beers. The next morning a friend approached me and asked why I slept\
  \ with her when she has herpes. I had no idea and obviously would not have slept\
  \ with her had I known. I was annoyed she did not disclose this and feel she had\
  \ a moral obligation to do so before sleeping with anyone.\n\nWhen I confronted\
  \ her she admitted she has genital herpes but said it wasn\u2019t a big deal, it\
  \ never flares up, she hasn\u2019t passed it on to anyone etc. I don\u2019t really\
  \ care for these excuses, and when I pushed her for an apology she said I was being\
  \ a pansy.\n\nFollowing this incident, I took it upon myself to share her herpes\
  \ status on our university\u2019s Facebook pages anonymously. I did this so that\
  \ other men (or women, if she swings that way) don\u2019t get tricked also. Although\
  \ it\u2019s obviously me that did it, she can\u2019t prove it, and I haven\u2019\
  t gotten in trouble for it.\n\nThat said, she has organised a campaign against me\
  \ for \u201Cslut shaming\u201D and \u201Charassment\u201D against her for the posts,\
  \ and successfully convinced a few groups of my guilt. The posts in question were\
  \ literally bland and vanilla: \u201CBeware of X. She has genital herpes and does\
  \ not disclose this fact to those she sleeps with.\u201D Absolutely no mean words\
  \ or slurs."
