selftext: "So I\u2019m 19(M). I\u2019m in college. I have small Instagram following.\
  \ Nothing outrageous. About a week ago I got offered to be in a music video. They\
  \ let me know the concept of it too. I\u2019d be with a guy and we\u2019d have to\
  \ kiss and stuff. I agreed because A) I\u2019m fan of the artist and B) I\u2019\
  m kinda broke rn. I ain\u2019t gay but 20 bucks is 20 bucks. \n\nI told my girlfriend\
  \ today and she lost her shit completely. She said that it would be cheating and\
  \ I\u2019m an asshole for not talking to her first and getting her permission.\n\
  \n##Edit: I\u2019m not actually getting paid 20 dollars. I thought that joke was\
  \ obvious. It\u2019s way more than $20."
