selftext: "Update 2: I told my ex to cancel her vacation as my son will not be going\
  \ because it affects my custody time. Yes, I told her it was okay but after her\
  \ husband's stunt of saying he couldn't do the sleepover which was on my day anyways,\
  \ I had to crack the whip. Let those two eat each other alive. They deserve each\
  \ other.\n\nUpdate 1: This HILARIOUS. My son's best friend mom emailed us an invite\
  \ for a sleepover which is on my DAY. I was going to see if my son wanted to go,\
  \ but my ex's husband said my son could not go as he was grounded. I can react in\
  \ so many ways...\n\n\nHis mom and I are divorced and don't have much of a relationship.\
  \ Cordial, but indifferent. Our son is now 11 and my ex remarried a few years ago\
  \ but she was with the guy for some time.\n\nWe have 50/50. She requested that she\
  \ have him for two weeks for vacation. I agreed even though this ate into my time\
  \ with him. Apparently, he got into it with step dad and he got grounded for a week.\
  \ Well, most of that week is my week with him before he leaves for vacation with\
  \ them and she asked me to see to it that his grounding continues through my time.\
  \ I won't see him for three weeks. I am not saying not to punish him. \n\nPunish\
  \ him when he's on their time. \n\nI have no problems with him when he's with me.\n\
  \nI refused.\n\nI already made plans to make most if the days that I have him and\
  \ I'm sure as hell am not going to cancel those plans because he mouthed off to\
  \ step-dad. I don't care much for step-dad anyways. What I do with my son on my\
  \ time is my business and vice-versa. \n\nAlso, I don't want to set precedent where\
  \ I am the parent who has to do both sides of discipline.\n\n\nEdit: Update: My\
  \ son called him a \"freaking asshole.\" My ex calls him the same thing when they\
  \ fight. Her words, not mine. He learned it from her, not me. I don't open share\
  \ my dislike for her husband. Maybe an eyeroll, but I'm too corporate and professional\
  \ to do it in front of my son."
