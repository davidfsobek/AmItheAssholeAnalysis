selftext: "My friends are dating, they\u2019re also actors who have had small roles\
  \ on a few tv shows (I\u2019m talking two lines or less). I say this not to be a\
  \ hater, I truly am rooting for them, but to give you a scope of their reach. Neither\
  \ of them have a following in real life or on social media (they\u2019ve got under\
  \ 1500 followers combined). \n\nAnyway last week I posted a group picture on Instagram\
  \ of people celebrating a friends birthday. Everyone in the photo has got their\
  \ arms around each other\u2019s shoulders. Very platonic. \n\nAnyway yesterday in\
  \ a group chat between the three of us they asked me to take the photo down because\
  \ they don\u2019t want \u201Cthe public\u201D to know they are dating. I would consider\
  \ it if they looked bad/too sloppy drunk/etc. but they don\u2019t. Also everyone\
  \ has their arms around each other, not just them. \n\nAnyway I asked what they\
  \ meant, and they said they didn\u2019t want to end up in gossip rags....\n\nI pointed\
  \ out that they are not famous and that they don\u2019t even have functioning IMDb\
  \ pages. They were livid and called me a bunch of names. \n\nI think they\u2019\
  re delusional but they\u2019ve been texting me demanding it and even sent me screenshots\
  \ of them reporting it (nothing has happened). At this point, I don\u2019t even\
  \ want to be their friend. However, and probably because I\u2019m an asshole, I\
  \ don\u2019t want to delete it based solely on principle.\n\nEdit: okay, so many\
  \ of y\u2019all are right. I suppose I should separate how I feel about their (ridiculous/delusional/stupid)\
  \ reasoning with the fact that no one should have an image of themselves online\
  \ that they don\u2019t want made public. I\u2019ll take it down."
