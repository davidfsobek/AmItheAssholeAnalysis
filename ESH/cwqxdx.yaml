selftext: "This is more of a \u2018are we the asshole\u2019 I guess. \n\nMy colleagues\
  \ and I work a very physically demanding job which amongst other things, also involves\
  \ pools/ life guarding. Because of that we have showers located at work as we are\
  \ constantly getting sweaty and grimy and need to wash off to attend to other duties/\
  \ be presentable. \n\nWhenever we finish \u2018dry reccing\u2019 which is basically\
  \ us attending to whatever dryside clean ups (not pool related) we are expected\
  \ to shower. Before you do that you go into the staff room to collect your personal\
  \ belongings like towels etc. \n\nOur female colleagues started to yell at us at\
  \ one point when summer got super hot, saying \u2018you smell of unwashed balls,\
  \ go shower!!\u2019 And other stuff that\u2019s pretty similar. We\u2019d get called\
  \ gross, some girls actually started to physically push us out the staff room in\
  \ order to try and get us to not stink up the place. Like yeah, we know we smell,\
  \ but we are literally going in to grab towels and leave not stand around and have\
  \ a chat. \n\nThis has become a near daily occurrence and frankly it\u2019s so fucking\
  \ annoying to walk into the staff room and immediately there\u2019s a group of girls\
  \ making faces and gagging when you\u2019ve literally just entered. \n\nLast week\
  \ 3 of the girls had gone to attend to dryside activities which meant that when\
  \ they came back, they were covered in sweat and grime too. (we work at an Olympic\
  \ facility and we have to put in a LOT of physical work in the heat so yeah, it\u2019\
  s bad) and so jokingly I said \u2018ew, smells like unwashed pussy, go shower\u2019\
  \ \n\nOne of the girls who is the most vocal about us smelling got super super offended\
  \ and started mouthing off that I was an asshole. A lot of the other guys, some\
  \ whom I don\u2019t even freaking talk to, joined in and said \u2018yeah, go shower!\
  \ Don\u2019t you tell us to leave as soon as we get in?\u2019. 2 of em took it well\
  \ and laughed but the third has been telling everyone and anyone about it all day.\
  \ \n\nMy boss just shrugged and told her if she could dish it she can take it, so\
  \ I\u2019m not worried about being in trouble at work, but I just want to know if\
  \ I\u2019m the asshole."
title: AITA for telling coworkers they smell of unwashed pussy after her and some
  other colleagues CONSTANTLY made jokes that we smell of unwashed balls?
