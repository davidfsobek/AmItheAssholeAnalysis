selftext: "My boss sent a wrong number text to me asking for nudes. I'm an ugly ass\
  \ hairy guy with acne and he's an attractive successful guy with abs who talks about\
  \ all the girls that fall for him on a daily basis, we were just talking about work\
  \ when he asked out of nowhere... He also didn't play it off as a joke which makes\
  \ me further believe it was a mistake and not actually something he meant to send\
  \ me.\n\n He said he was sorry and stuff, but the thing that got me was that the\
  \ message had the shift leads name on it, I was gunning for this promotion and worked\
  \ my ass off and was surprised to hear the position went to her. She had been there\
  \ one 2 months and I had been there almost a year when she got it... I couldn't\
  \ help but think that she only got the position because she was sleeping with Mr\
  \ Nipple Flex.. so I told HR. After about a month of getting calls and stuff from\
  \ the DM they were both suddenly gone and replaced by a new manager.. I now have\
  \ the shift lead position, but I feel kind of bad that they got fired...\n\n Some\
  \ of the other employees say they knew they were sleeping together, but didn't really\
  \ care...\n\nEdit: it seems it was the right thing to do to report them, but it\
  \ was a bit scummy to only care because I had a better position on the line. So\
  \ what I learned is I need to be more selfless and allow bad things to happen if\
  \ I only care about stopping the bad thing because it effects my life.\n\nIs this\
  \ what it's like to be a politician?\n\nEdit 2: some people NEED to understand this,\
  \ coworkers can date and even get married more power to them if they do, BUT supervisors\
  \ and subordinates cannot regardless of when or how the relationship starts or how\
  \ professional they both are and this is the case within MOST if not all companies\
  \ and is always a conflict of interest. Regarding if I had a position on the line\
  \ or not what they were doing was wrong, and I'm only a meanie head because I reported\
  \ it and got something out of it in return\n\nEdit 3: the girl is 19 this is her\
  \ second job and she was still learning the job a month into being a lead for all\
  \ the people saying I'm an ass for assuming she didn't have immense graduate experience\
  \ in this job prior"
title: AITA for telling HR that my boss asked me for nudes, even though it was an
  accident, and getting him and the person it was meant for fired?
