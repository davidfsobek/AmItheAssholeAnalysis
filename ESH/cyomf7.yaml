selftext: "My wife is 12 weeks pregnant and is having a really rough time with morning\
  \ sickness. She'll typically throw up about 7-10 times a day despite being on the\
  \ same medication they give chemo patients. To give some context; this pregnancy\
  \ is her second - the first pregnancy was slightly better in terms of sickness (only\
  \ 4-7 spews a day!) but it lasted pretty much the full 9 months.\n\nShe is an actual\
  \ trooper and I'll forever be thankful for what she goes through to bring our beautiful\
  \ children in to this world. I've made a point of taking up extra slack, doing more\
  \ chores around the house, more cooking and taking on additional childcare duties\
  \ to give her a much needed break.\n\nUnfortunately for me, she has a terrible vomiting\
  \ technique. When she has the need, she'll stand over the toilet, bend over ever\
  \ so slightly and hit the eject button. The angle she bends down at can conveniently\
  \ be demonstrated by a rough ASCII diagram:\n\n       \xB4\u0F40`\n      /   \n\
  \     /    |\n    |   __|\n    |  |  |\n    |  |__|\n\nWith most of the spews being\
  \ projectile, needless to say, we end up with an extremely messy toilet area. There\
  \ is vomit everywhere. On the seat. Under the seat. On the floor around the toilet.\
  \ The toilet she uses most of the time during the day is located in a small room,\
  \ about 1.5 meters wide with the toilet in the center. As I type this, both walls\
  \ on either side are showered in remnants of one particularly violent session. I\
  \ do not understand the physics of this; all I know is that I am disgusted.\n\n\
  I asked her to clean up after herself but she is resistant. She has always been\
  \ quite lazy when it comes to cleaning up and is an untidy person; generally happy\
  \ to live in what I deem to be pretty dirty conditions. From my perspective, this\
  \ is next level filth and is unacceptable despite her current condition, particularly\
  \ because it could be resolved with an improved technique.\n\nShe says that she\
  \ doesn't want to get closer to the toilet because it's gross, made more unpleasant\
  \ because she has to do it so frequently throughout the day. Her position is that\
  \ cleaning the toilet for her is the least I could do considering she is likely\
  \ going to have to do this for the next 6 months.\n\nReddit, you will determine\
  \ who cleans our toilets post-spews for the next 6 months. The stakes are high.\
  \ Do not hesitate. Every seconds counts."
