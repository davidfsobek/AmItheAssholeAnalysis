selftext: "Me(39), my wife(38)and our son(16) are sharing his laptop currently. Me\
  \ and my wife had our laptop, but it\u2019s broken and it\u2019s getting fixed now.\
  \ We\u2019ve been sharing it for a week.\n\nIt was late at night, me and my wife\
  \ wanted to watch some movies in bed, I went to his room, knocked, he didn\u2019\
  t answer so I went it slowly, he was asleep with laptop on bed. I took it and went\
  \ back to our bedroom. I opened the laptop, he left gay porn on. Like I was dumb\
  \ teen and forgot to delete browser history multiple times, but I have never just\
  \ left it open. \n\nI turned it off quickly, I kinda knew he was gay already so\
  \ I wasn\u2019t that shocked. My wife however was really shocked. She told me that\
  \ we\u2019d have to talk to him tomorrow. I don\u2019t see what is there to talk\
  \ about, he\u2019s a teen, he watches porn, he\u2019s not out to us, so I don\u2019\
  t think it\u2019s right to embarrass him like that and say \u201Chey, we saw you\
  \ were watching gay porn\u201D. I asked my wife why exactly she wanted to talk and\
  \ what would we even talk about. She didn\u2019t actually answer the question, she\
  \ just said that we HAVE to talk to him and she would alone if I wouldn\u2019t.\
  \ \n\nSince talking to her normally didn\u2019t work, I told her not to speak about\
  \ it at all or I\u2019d cancel the vacation we\u2019ve been planning for months.\
  \ She got quiet and turned around. Next day she didn\u2019t talk to me normally,\
  \ she called me manipulative."
title: AITA for not letting my wife talk to our son and threatening to cancel vacation.
