selftext: "I am not a morning person. I have been grumpy in the morning my entire\
  \ life. I do not want to talk about anything important or have any kind of small\
  \ talk in the morning. I will answer yes or no questions, but that\u2019s about\
  \ it. My parents know this and we spent mornings together in silence growing up.\
  \ My husband has known this since we met but refuses to accept it. He is incredibly\
  \ perky in the morning and wants to talk about anything and everything. We both\
  \ were working jobs where we set our start times. I purposely get up and out of\
  \ the house before he\u2019s awake to avoid him and his cheery-ness and prevent\
  \ any unnecessary fights because I know I\u2019ll be fine in a little bit. \n\n\
  I\u2019m off today but was woken up at 6:15 by our one year old. Great, that\u2019\
  s when he gets ready for work \U0001F615 So he tries talking to me, I don\u2019\
  t even remember at this point what it was about. But I gave my short answers that\
  \ he thinks is rude and that warrants a conversation about how I am in the morning.\
  \ I said something about I\u2019m not a morning person and you\u2019ve known this\
  \ for four years. But that\u2019s not good enough for him so I get told that I \u201C\
  don\u2019t get to talk to [him] this way.\u201D And he decides this is the time\
  \ to talk about how I need to change who I am in the morning. So I said \u201CFuck\
  \ off and leave\u201D because that is the worst time for me to have any kind of\
  \ serious conversation. He again told me I don\u2019t get to talk to him that way\
  \ and has continued texting me all morning from work about how my behavior is unacceptable.\
  \ And, even though I\u2019ve sent him articles explaining the concept of \u201C\
  not a morning person,\u201D he continues to tell me it\u2019s not okay and needs\
  \ to change. I think he\u2019s the asshole for not accepting something because it\u2019\
  s different than his ways and telling me I have to change. He thinks I\u2019m as\
  \ asshole for how I speak to him in the morning. \n\nSo, AITA for telling my husband\
  \ to \u201Cfuck off and leave\u201D?"
