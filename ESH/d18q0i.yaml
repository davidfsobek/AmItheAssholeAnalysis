selftext: "My (m30) boyfriend and I (f21) have been dating for a couple of years,\
  \ live together and have a very active sex life (at least 1-2 x everyday) so naturally\
  \ I\u2019ve always been on birth control (pills or iud). When we have sex my boyfriend\
  \ obviously prefers to finish inside of me and although I enjoy it as well, the\
  \ after math just isn\u2019t great. We usually have sex in the mornings before Work\
  \ which already makes me later and I have to shower after (even though I showered\
  \ in the evening) so I\u2019m extra rushed getting ready. I also just don\u2019\
  t think it\u2019s healthy for anyone\u2019s PH when it\u2019s happening so often.\
  \ Anyways. I told my boyfriend this and he agreed to only finish in me once in a\
  \ while but every single time after it was the exact same. We got into arguments\
  \ about this and basically he told me he can\u2019t control it blah blah blah. Annoying.\
  \ So after my next doctors appointment I decided to tell my boyfriend my IUD had\
  \ shifted and i had to have it removed. (Honestly I don\u2019t even know if that\u2019\
  s a thing but my boyfriend isn\u2019t exactly a rocket scientist so I wasn\u2019\
  t concerned) Since then he\u2019s been pulling out and it\u2019s been great. However,\
  \ we have had a couple of incidents where he didn\u2019t pull out on time and he\u2019\
  s been stressed that I could\u2019ve gotten pregnant. Because there\u2019s no explanation\
  \ that I could give him as to why I know we have nothing to worry about I fake worry\
  \ a bit with him which makes him stress out more and so on until I get my period\
  \ or he buys a test Anyways, recently we were having sex and afterwards I having\
  \ some cramping and when he asked me what was wrong I totally let it slip by saying\
  \ that certain positions always hurt more with the IUD \U0001F926\u200D\u2640\uFE0F\
  \ Now he\u2019s completely mad at me for lying and cause unnecessary stress. I definitely\
  \ see his point and I feel bad lying but he refused to accommodate at all with me\
  \ and magically could only control himself when there was a chance I could get pregnant.\
  \ AITA?"
