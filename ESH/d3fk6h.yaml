selftext: ' Many times I arrived home before my wife does so I  cook. I''m no chef
  but so far everyone enjoys most of the things I cook. Even my step kids prefer how
  I cook some dishes better than my wife. Like many days I arrived earlier today and
  started the process of cooking some condiments for the food when my wife arrived
  and started to criticised the amount of oil and the way I was cooking. I didn''t
  snapped or yell I just took the pan and dumped the contents and put it back to the
  range and told her to cook if she didn''t like the way I was doing it. Opened a
  beer and sat in the couch. I know this is not the best way to handle this situation
  but i don''t complain or do the same when she is cooking.


  PS. Sorry for the format I''m on mobile.


  Edit: I didn''t dumped food, it was just oil, onions, peppers and some tomato sauce.


  Edit: Not the first time she criticises what I''m doing as I have mentioned in the
  comments. You are using too much oil, why you are using to much sauce (it''s pasta
  it''s supposed to have sauce) not enough cajun seasoning (not everyone eats spicy
  in the house).'
title: AITA for dumping what I was cooking and telling my wife to do it herself after
  she started criticising how I was doing it?
