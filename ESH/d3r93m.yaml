selftext: "I'm in my early 30s and my parents are in their 60s. A few years ago they\
  \ retired and bought a house in an all inclusive 55+ community after some touch\
  \ and go money issues.\n\nMy childhood home was in an upper middle class neighborhood,\
  \ I was spoiled, but my dad lost his executive job in my teens and my parents kept\
  \ spending. Things got bad until they received a 1mil inheritance, but they soon\
  \ spent that too. They planned to retire to a smaller house in the planned community,\
  \ but they had trouble selling and almost ran out of money. Finally everything worked\
  \ out and they were supposed to be on a tight budget. They have been lamenting that\
  \ they can't afford a vacation.\n\nI had issues with mental illness and severe substance\
  \ abuse my whole life but I've been clean for a couple years now and finally getting\
  \ my life together. I have a good job but with my doctor's bills and catching up\
  \ I live paycheck to paycheck. Last year I was happy to surprise them by giving\
  \ them part of my yearly bonus just as a gesture.\n\nThis year, after I heard they\
  \ couldn't take a vacation, I again gave them most of my yearly bonus to earmark\
  \ for a trip (about $800.) I could have really used it, but I felt bad and they've\
  \ spent so much on me over the years. I wasn't completely financially independent\
  \ until I got clean.\n\nBut now my mom calls my brother to say they're excited that\
  \ they were approved for an equity loan so that she can replace the carpets with\
  \ wood floors in their house that's less than 3 years old. It cost 3k. \n\nI called\
  \ them, told them they can do what they want, but to stop pretending they're poor\
  \ when they're obviously not. And that it's my opinion they should stop being so\
  \ financially irresponsible. 3k to remove carpets is frivolous. I didn't say it\
  \ but I promised myself I wouldn't give them any more money for vacations.\n\nIt's\
  \ caused this huge fight and some people are saying I was unreasonable. AITA?\n\n\
  ------\nINFO: They did say they still intend to take the vacation, but it's been\
  \ months, we're not speaking because of this, and they haven't yet. I told them\
  \ I was giving them the money for a specific trip that is their favorite. I did\
  \ that because I thought they might feel obligated to just put it toward their day-to-day\
  \ expenses or save it or something (lol in retrospect.)\n\nINFO 2 if anyone new\
  \ is still reading this: I didn't book the trip for them because they're very picky.\
  \ Like my Mom thinks everything that's not a resort is dirty and my dad has really\
  \ bizarre requirements for travel and accommodation that I don't understand. It\
  \ seemed like a better idea to let them book whatever meets their preferences. I\
  \ mentioned this, pretty much verbatim when I sent them the cash.\n\nAlso since\
  \ I'm updating thanks everyone for the input. It's been awesome to see all the viewpoints,\
  \ and I think I have more awareness about the whole thing. I was never planning\
  \ to stop talking to them forever because while I often don't like them I of course\
  \ love them. I just need a break for a little because my feelings were hurt."
title: AITA for blowing up at my parents after I gave them my yearly bonus because
  they "couldn't afford" a vacation but then they spent 3k on wood floors?
