  \ 2 years. His parents visit us few times a month. Every damn time they visit us\
  \ they make comment about my skin, I\u2019m extremely pale, almost white. At first\
  \ I just laughed it off, but then it got irritating. They could tell that I wad\
  \ clearly uncomfortable and still continued making comments. \n\nThe thing is, my\
  \ boyfriend has a thing for pale skin. So few days ago they visited us again, his\
  \ mom made comment about my skin 2 times and I answered with \u201Cyeah, your son\
  \ has fetish for it\u201D. My boyfriend just chuckled, they got really quiet and\
  \ didn\u2019t talk to me for rest of the night. They left, they told my boyfriend\
  \ that they felt disrespected and I was extremely inappropriate and immature. My\
  \ boyfriend doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal but he says it was a little\
  \ immature."
