selftext: 'Hello. I live in an apartment with my roommate Jess. I also have an expensive
  ice cream habit.


  She often has family over, most often her mom. Her mom really gets on my nerves.
  She''s hyper religious and makes snarky comments about my tattoos and piercings
  whenever she''s over. I usually just blank her and pretend she''s not there and
  she gets bored until next time.


  Today her mom was over with some kid. Not sure how he''s related to her and don''t
  really care. I was in my room avoiding them because they were being loud for most
  of the afternoon but eventually I kinda wanted to have some of my ice cream.


  Went out there and this woman was fixing a bowl of my (expensive) ice cream!!! I
  went out there and asked her what the hell she was doing and she said she said "getting
  a bowl of ice cream for Jacob" like it wasn''t a rhetorical question, handing it
  to the kid in the process. I said absolutely not, it''s mine. She said she didn''t
  know but just to let Jacob have this bowl. I said NO and took it off the kid. Kid
  started crying and the mom started yelling at me but I cut her off and told her
  that if I came out there and saw her stealing my food again that I would throw them
  both out myself. Went back in my room to enjoy my ice cream.


  Roommate was furious saying that I made kid cry and they had to leave early. I said
  I didn''t care and to control her guests when they come over, or better yet not
  have her insufferable mother over in general. We''re currently nto talking. Was
  I really being that unreasonable?'
