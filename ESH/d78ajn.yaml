selftext: "Throwaway bc friends know my reddit\n\nThe story begins when my mother\
  \ abruptly rushed on a plane earlier this year to visit my grandmother. Her condition\
  \ had begun to worsen and obviously she immideatly went out to be with her. She\
  \ was shortly moved to hospice care and it became clear that the end was near. My\
  \ mom told us all to fly out to be with her in her final days, but my Dad was busy\
  \ with work, so it was decided that me (20M) and my brother (16M, who's also been\
  \ completely blind since birth) would go by ourselves. \n\nThis was a shitty time\
  \ to go for multiple reasons. Not only was there obviously school, but my younger\
  \ brother also had a high fever at the time and pretty much felt like shit. But\
  \ of course, we were gonna go regardless.\n\nI obviously needed to be next to him\
  \ on the plane, and the only 2 available seats tight next to eachother happened\
  \ to be the middle and window seat of a row, with the aisle seat already booked.\
  \ Not ideal, but we didn't have time to mess around. \n\nWe got to the airport and\
  \ went through security and etc. My brother was really not in any shape to travel\
  \ and was constantly complaining. Not sure if it was just him being a teenage boy\
  \ or the fever, but most likely both.\n\nWe finally get on the plane and find that\
  \ a rather large man is seated in the aisle already. He gets out and allows us to\
  \ get in our seats. shortly after we take off, my brother needs to use the bathroom.\
  \ I tell the man in the aisle that he needs to get up and he seems annoyed but cooperates.\
  \ I lead him to the bathroom and we go back to the seats. Because he was sick, he\
  \ had to rush to the bathroom pretty much every 45 minutes, and I could tell the\
  \ guy in the aisle was really starting to get pissed off. \n\nWhen there was about\
  \ an hour left of the flight, my brother tells me he has to go again and I tap the\
  \ guy on the shoulder. This time I could tell he had reached his limit. He fumed\
  \ something along the lines of \"If you have a special needs kid with you, you should\
  \ plan your seats accordingly\". I like to think I'm a pretty levelheaded guy, but\
  \ when people make assumptions and use such rude and derogatory terms it just really\
  \ ticks me off. He had also been making passive aggressive remarks under his breath\
  \ for the whole flight. My brother started smiling because he knew this is the kind\
  \ of thing that makes me mad. I responded with \"well maybe if you're a fatass you\
  \ shouldn't book aisle seats if you can't be bothered to heave yourself out of for\
  \ people who want to get out\". \n\nI could tell he was completely taken aback by\
  \ what I said and he just got out of the seat and let us go. When we returned he\
  \ gave me a dirty look and didn't say anything the rest of the flight. As we were\
  \ getting off the plane I could see him talking to a flight attendant about what\
  \ I can only assume was us.\n\nI can understand being frustrated with having to\
  \ constantly be getting up, but I feel like what he said was just not acceptable.\
  \ AITA?\n\nEdit: Wow really didn't expect this to blow up, thank you all for the\
  \ responses. I can clearly see I've been judged as an asshole.\n\nTo clarify a few\
  \ things:\n\nMany people have commented on the fact that my brother shouldn't have\
  \ been on the flight at all. While you're all right, the entire trip was very last\
  \ minute as I said before. It wasn't clear if she would die in a week or a day so\
  \ we wanted to be there ASAP. I'm not an idiot but since I didn't mention it I can\
  \ see why I'd seem like one. He was wearing a surgical mask the entire time on the\
  \ plane, as well as most of the time we were in hospice with my grandmother.\n\n\
  Second, I didn't totally put him off the whole time. I actually told him in the\
  \ middle of the flight that I was sorry if all the getting up was a problem. I know\
  \ this doesn't change the fact that I've been judged by the internet, but hopefully\
  \ it clarifies some things. Again thanks for all the responses, they've been fun\
  \ to read with my bro.\n\nEdit 2: There are many comments on this post talking about\
  \ how my little brother having a fever could pose a potential threat to elderly\
  \ people/those with compromised immune systems in hospice. When I read theese comments\
  \ I was initially confused because I didn't realize what people they were talking\
  \ about, but it became clear they were just assuming she was at a hospital/some\
  \ kind of center. She was receiving hospice care in her home. \n\nI'd also like\
  \ to add that on the day we flew, he had already been feverish for multiple days\
  \ and was, hard as it is to believe, out of the woods. When we arrived in Monterey\
  \ (where grandma lived) he started feeling shortly."

  a flight?
