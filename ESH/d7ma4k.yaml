selftext: "Me and Diomara (12F) have had a rough summer.  She's been more defiant\
  \ than usual.  I've been dating her Mom Mara (30F) for 2 years now.  9 moths ago,\
  \ they moved in with me, Maple (33M).  Both Dio and Mara have an on again/off again\
  \ relationship with Dio's Dad (Dynasis).  He's pretty much never paid child support,\
  \ comes and goes as he pleases into Dio's life.   Typical shitty-ass part time Dad.\
  \  I've tried to fill the Dad role in her life, while still understanding boundaries,\
  \ taking things slow, etc.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis summer Dynasis decides he wants\
  \ to be a real Dad and takes Dio in for a month.  Good for him, not my business,\
  \ and Mara agrees.  When Dio came back home because school started she was a lot\
  \ different.  Really mean to me, very dismissive.  A few days ago she got caught\
  \ shoplifting at the mall.  Security took her in then called Mara, who didn't answer,\
  \ then called Dynasis, who didn't answer, and finally me.  I answered.  They told\
  \ me I had to pick her up or she'll be handed over to juvenile.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\
  I didn't say anything to her while I picked her up.  I apologized to security, apologized\
  \ to the store.  I even tipped the security guards plus the store employees because\
  \ its fucked up they had to deal with that.  I assured them Dio would be punished\
  \ appropriately.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm speaking to her in a strong, affirmative,\
  \ voice while we're in the car.  NOT yelling, but in a fatherly tone, I suppose.\
  \  I'm telling her how fucked up it is to steal, and how I dont fuck with thieves,\
  \ and how I absolutely don't voluntarily fuck with any kind of police so I don't\
  \ appreciate any of this nor will I accept it in my house.  She snaps back that\
  \ I'm not her Dad so don't ever tell her what to do.  From now on, if I wanna tell\
  \ her something I need to clear it with her real father first.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\
  That killed my soul.  For the past year or so, I've treated her as my own daughter.\
  \  I've paid for their housing, I've paid for her moms car, her schooling, her food,\
  \ everything.  Her bio Dad dropped $100 check off one time in the past year.  The\
  \ fuckin check bounced so I had to call him up and he brought cash over.  I told\
  \ Mara about all of this.  She was appalled at what Dio said, but she never made\
  \ Dio apologize because \"she's not wrong, you're not her Dad.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\
  A couple of days later Dio asks me for some money to pay for her uniform/accessories\
  \ she needs for a sport she's involved in.  I say go ask your Dad.  She scoffs and\
  \ says her Dad doesn't have the money for it, so I have to pay for it.  I tell her...I'm\
  \ not her Dad so don't ever tell me what I have to pay for.  She cried to Mara,\
  \ who tells me I'm not being an adult about the situation.  Mind you, I never received\
  \ an apology or a thanks for our entire previous situation.  Mara says Dio is a\
  \ kid and I need to stop acting like a kid too."
title: AITA for telling my GF's daughter she's not my daughter so don't expect me
  to pay?
