selftext: "My dead wife is always going to hold a special place in my heart. It\u2019\
  s not like I talk about her all the time, but I do have tons of pictures of her/letters\
  \ from her that I keep and I have them all sitting in an attic. \n\nSometimes I\
  \ will reminisce when no one is around, it\u2019s not like I do it often. But I\
  \ feel like I owe her that much and she didn\u2019t die with us not loving each\
  \ other. \n\nI just got married to my newer wife two years ago. She\u2019s great\
  \ and all, but one time she got pissed at me. When I wrote something on fb about\
  \ my dead wife, It wasn\u2019t even bad. I\u2019m friends with her family on Facebook\
  \ still and they came to my wedding. It was just a small tribute. \n\nSo I said\
  \ I wouldn\u2019t do it again. Then she got mad a different time because she found\
  \ me looking at photos/reading notes from her that I still have. She said I need\
  \ to let her go, and that she knows that I loved her but your life is with me now.\
  \ \n\nI don\u2019t do this often, it\u2019s just on occasion. The final straw is\
  \ she saw me comment on a family members fb about her. \n\nThen she said this...\
  \ do you love her or me more? And she wanted me to answer the question. I told her\
  \ enough, and I never want her bringing up her name again. Never do I want her to\
  \ say her fucking name again and drop it. Basically, I did tell her to shut the\
  \ f*** up.\n\nShe told me I\u2019m not sleeping with her tonight and go sleep on\
  \ the couch and fuck off. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing, out of respect for my current\
  \ wife. I do not bring up my dead wife often. I try to avoid talking about her altogether\
  \ because of how she feels. I do these things all away from her, and she\u2019s\
  \ still judging me for it."
