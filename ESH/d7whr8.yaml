selftext: "There is no sugar coating: I'm fat. If I had to give you a description..\
  \ I'd say I'm the child of Jack Black and Gabriel Iglesias. I've been this way for\
  \ years and have slowly tried to make my way to breaking my horrible habits.\n\n\
  \nMy whole family doesnt seem to believe it's possible for me. They give me 0 support\
  \ and it's tough. I eat healthy foods and go to the YMCA every chance I get. I've\
  \ been eating Salads, Tuna, Chicken, etc. At certain times and in portions and have\
  \ been for months. If I'm eating something and a family member walks in, I get ridiculed\
  \ and made fun of. They will try teasing my with horrible foods that me from a year\
  \ ago would seek my soul for. \n\nYesterday my sister(20) and her boyfriend(22)\
  \ came over. I was eating and immediately knew something was about to going to happen.\
  \ She does her usual: grabbing food and eating it close to me tauntingly and saying\
  \ my efforts arent going to work. Yesterday it got to me and I snapped. I threw\
  \ her food at her and told her to leave me the fuck alone. Saying stuff like \"\
  how the fuck did you manage to get a boyfriend you sleezy slut?\"\n\n\nWell later\
  \ that day I got confronted by my mom(M) and she said it was horrible and I should\
  \ apologise to her. I was dumbfounded. Annoyed. The trade of words:\n\nM: You need\
  \ to apologise to your sister. Dont disrespect her like that ever again.\n\nMe:\
  \ I'm not apologising for standing up to the constant bullshit she gives me. You\
  \ too. Fuck both of you.\n\nAnything after that is yelling.\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\n\
  \nEdit: thank you for your input guys! I appreciate the health tips. As of age,\
  \ I'm 16 and cant move out. My mother has always been mentally abusive (rarely physically\
  \ since I've always out-weighed her) and my fathers MIA. I realise I shouldn't have\
  \ lashed out at my sister but I dont regret what I've said. I wont apologise for\
  \ speaking my (truth) opinion. None of their words will affect my goal to lose weight."
