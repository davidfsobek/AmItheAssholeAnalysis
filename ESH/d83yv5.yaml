selftext: 'He is not allergic. I would bet my dogs on it.

  I have seen this man eat peanut butter. I have seen him put almond milk in his coffee.  He
  ate pastry I brought for the office. Pastry with nut cream. There is no way he is
  for real.



  But why would I bother with it? Because he is such an asshole about it. Everytime
  someone brings food he LOUDLY questions them about it and then gives a speech about
  his "allergy".  A month ago one person brought a cake to work. For their birthday.
  Which was such s nice thing and everyone loved it. Almost everyone. This fucking
  guy starts asking about the cake. Does it contain this or that. Poor girl wasn''t
  sure if the cake had any nuts or not. So he made another speech. In the end he goes
  and I qoute "Maybe next time make sure everyone can enjoy the treat."




  It''s free cake. She could have said fuck it I''m not bringing anything. But that
  is not what pissed me off the most. Last Friday he refused to shake my hand because
  he saw me eating a protein bar on my break and it looked like it had nuts in it.  I
  spent the whole weekend thinking of ways to expose him. So, Would I be the asshole
  if I did that?'
