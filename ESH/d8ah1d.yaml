selftext: "Okay so a few days ago i went to a nice cafe with my friend. We decided\
  \ to sit in a corner that was close enough to the bar. We didn\u2019t even took\
  \ our jacket off yet and a young teenager (13 or something?) came towards us. \n\
  \n\u201CI always sit there.\u201D\n-\u201COh well... it won\u2019t bother you if\
  \ you sat somewhere else wouldn\u2019t it?\u201D\n\nThe kid suddenly starts screaming\
  \ for his mother and she came ASAP. The kid told her in tears that we \u2018stole\u2019\
  \ his favorite place and pushed him away while doing so (we didn\u2019t even touched\
  \ him). His mother comforted him and told us with a painfully forced smile that\
  \ they always sat there since he was a baby and that it was \u2018their special\
  \ spot\u2019. I politely told her that i wasn\u2019t planning on moving since we\
  \ had this table first. The kid starts screaming, letting himself fall on the floor\
  \ while his mother started to yell at us for being \u2018rude and unreasonable people\u2019\
  \ and that her son is autistic and doesn\u2019t likes changes. People were now looking\
  \ at us and quickly the manager came. They clearly knew each other and the mother\
  \ started to say that they were loyal customers, coming every 2 Friday nights since\
  \ the birth of her son and that she wouldn\u2019t be throwing a fit if the manager\
  \ didn\u2019t just banned all those rude young people. \n\nThe dad just stood there\
  \ and glared a bit at us but that\u2019s it. After a couple of minutes they left\
  \ while pulling the kid out of the place. \n\nMy friend told me that we just had\
  \ to move to another table to avoid such thing since autistic kids/people will get\
  \ frustrated if things don\u2019t go their way.\n\nAITA for this?\n\nEdit: The place\
  \ was already full and the only tables that were free still had dirty plates on\
  \ it."
