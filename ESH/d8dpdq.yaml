selftext: "I\u2019ve had a spider in my office space for a few months now. She\u2019\
  s a cool, small, little thing who chills near my desk and occasionally I bring her\
  \ lil treats to eat. Sometimes she disappears and sometimes she comes back. I\u2019\
  ve named her. I like her. \n\nMy colleague Michelle is aware of the spider, and\
  \ is always complaining that it\u2019s a pest and needs to be killed. Recently she\
  \ saw the web, not even the actual spider, and started an official whiteboard scoresheet\
  \ if anyone is in favor of the spider being removed. Apparently she\u2019s super\
  \ scared and terrified and being even a little bit close to my office is enough\
  \ to make her jittery. \n\nLuckily most people voted that the spider stays, but\
  \ a few of her friends wrote some strongly worded notes that the spider is a sign\
  \ of poor housekeeping etc. I must admit I was a little peeved at this, especially\
  \ because we are a pet friendly workspace and Michelle\u2019s own dog comes in to\
  \ work sometimes and we have people who are genuinely frightened of dogs and Michelle\
  \ doesn\u2019t bother keeping her on a leash or anything. \n\nIt came to a head\
  \ when we had a meeting and Michelle bought up that she refused to go into my office\
  \ because of the spider and she was scared of it. My boss was a little irritated\
  \ and told me to remove it or kill it, I straight up refused and told him he wouldn\u2019\
  t ask Michelle to remove her dog and the spider is a LOT less threatening than a\
  \ poorly behaved dog. He ultimately agreed and since then all she\u2019s done is\
  \ go on about how I don\u2019t care about her feelings and that I must enjoy watching\
  \ her suffer."
title: AITA for refusing to kill the office spider despite one of my colleagues being
  scared of it?
