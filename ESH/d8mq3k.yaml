selftext: "My ex and I broke up and I found out I was pregnant very early on, at about\
  \ 4 wks gestation (so 2 weeks after the last time we had sex). Funny enough we actually\
  \ agreed to \"not try, not prevent\", so it wasn't exactly unplanned. We wanted\
  \ to have a baby. We broke up kind of suddenly and probably for stupid reasons but\
  \ all in all, it was for the best. \n\nHe was in denial after I told him for a while\
  \ and never checked up on me, so two weeks later I asked him if he wanted to be\
  \ involved in the baby's life or if I should just plan on being a single parent.\
  \ He says \"of course\" he wants to be in the baby's life. He asked what I need\
  \ from him. I say right now I just need some emotional support, ask me how I am\
  \ from time to time, maybe come to the first ultrasound, that kind of thing. He\
  \ agreed to all things.\n\nHowever, whenever if bring anything up about my pregnancy\
  \ and future logistics, he'd shut down completely. Not once did he ask me how I\
  \ am. We talked daily about anything else but my pregnancy and any mention of it\
  \ I'd get left on read. \n\nI quickly gave up and the last time I ever mentioned\
  \ anything about it was at 7 weeks when I told him the day & time of my first ultrasound\
  \ at 8 weeks (I've had an early miscarriage before so my doctor wanted to see me\
  \ for blood tests and to date the pregnancy earlier than usual). I said I'd really\
  \ like him there as I don't have anyone else around and that it would mean a lot.\
  \ He just responded \"ok\". I didn't bring it up again, neither did he, and of course\
  \ he didn't come. He didn't ask how it went. We literally have not discussed anything\
  \ pregnancy related since I told him that. \n\nWell, I just found out yesterday\
  \ at my 12 week appointment that I've miscarried. There is no heartbeat. I am absolutely\
  \ brokenhearted, even though my ex has been distant, I did want this baby. \n\n\
  I feel like telling him is going to stress me out too much. I can't stand to be\
  \ left on read about this. If I could guarantee some real empathy from him, I'd\
  \ tell him. But for now I feel like, since he's not checking up on me at all, he\
  \ probably doesn't care to know. \n\nI told myself I'd tell him if/when he asks\
  \ about things. Who knows when that will be, though? \n\nWIBTA if I don't tell him,\
  \ and let him continue to think I'm pregnant until he asks how I am or asks anything\
  \ about the pregnancy? I don't intend to lie to him at all. I just don't feel like\
  \ I need to volunteer the information if he doesn't care enough to check in."
