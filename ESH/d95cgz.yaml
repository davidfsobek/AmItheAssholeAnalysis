selftext: " Me \\[33F\\] and my bf \\[32M\\] have been together 2 years. When we met\
  \ he was living with his parents\\*, and I was new to the area with a 1-bed apartment.\
  \ I work an office job, regular 9-6 + occasional weekends for deadlines. He\u2019\
  s a freelance arts teacher, part-time hours, and they can be at a different school\
  \ every day. His salary's not 100% stable, but on average I make about 3x his wage.\
  \ The rent on my place eats about a third of my salary.\n\nHe's such a sweet, creative\
  \ guy and I fell for him from the first date - we're inseparable and he's been staying\
  \ at my place 5 nights a week basically from the day we hooked up. 2 mornings a\
  \ week he teaches at schools near his parents' place, and so those days he sleeps\
  \ back with his folks otherwise he'd have to get up like an hour earlier if he stayed\
  \ over with me. It sucks 'cos I want to go to sleep next to him every night, but\
  \ nobody wants to get up at 5am, so I don't feel emotionally abandoned or anything\
  \ by this.\n\nBut: in these 2 years he hasn't contributed a cent of rent. He contributes\
  \ \"in kind\" a bit - cooks maybe a couple of meals a week (I can't cook, we dine\
  \ out for the rest), does the washing up (though not very well, grr). Meanwhile,\
  \ he pays rent to his parents for those 2 nights a week, whereas he's in my apartment\
  \ 5 nights a week. So, the other day we had That Conversation: I said that I want\
  \ us to live together officially, I want us to be a household, and that means him\
  \ making reliable contributions. I don't need his money to make rent, but, I guess...\
  \ I want his commitment, his investment? Idk if that makes sense. If we split the\
  \ rent 50/50 that would be 1/2 of his salary going to rent, 1/6th of my salary going\
  \ to rent.\n\nI thought this was entirely reasonable - romantic, even, we were finally\
  \ going to have Our Home, not just My Home!\n\nWell. Nope. I got a lot of pushback.\
  \ \"I'm so poor compared to you, it's not fair that you're asking for 50/50 when\
  \ you make so much and I make so little\"; \"I'd still have to send money to my\
  \ parents\\*, they're my parents, I can't just cut their income stream without warning\"\
  ; \"If I have to pay rent I'll have no savings or security!\"; \"If I do this, you'll\
  \ pay for us whenever we go out to eat right? I won't be able to afford to go to\
  \ restaurants or movies with you otherwise\"; \"You'd be lonely if I didn't come\
  \ over, I\u2019m doing you a favor\"\n\nI was astonished. I was crying by the end\
  \ of the conversation. I don't feel like I'm asking for something unreasonable.\
  \ I'm not asking him to start contributing to my saving-to-buy-a-house fund that\
  \ I hope he'll live in with me one day, I'm just asking for an equal split of the\
  \ month-by-month, fundamental price of keeping a roof over both our heads. AITA?\n\
  \n\\*(As I get to the end it occurs to me that it might be relevant to specify that\
  \ he's Asian, so the whole lives with parents beyond 18 / sends money to parents\
  \ thing is sorta the default for him)"
