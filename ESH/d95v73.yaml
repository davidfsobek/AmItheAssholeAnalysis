  I have recently switched to a vegan diet due to environmental and ethical reasons.
  All my close friends know this.


  We usually go for a fancy dinner from time to time as an event (approximately 4
  times a year), with one of my close group of friends (we''re 5).


  Recently a dinner of such was being planned. All 5 of them know that I eat vegan.
  I have kindly asked if we could pick a place where I could order a regular dish,
  but I did not require a strictly vegan restaurant, as it''s their decision what
  they decide to eat. We live in a capital city in western europe, meaning there are
  plenty of such places.


  However, my friends have mocked me for my decision to not eat animal products and
  have chosen a place without a single vegan option, joking along "it won''t hurt
  once in a while", "just half a year ago we were in a steakhouse with you", "give
  up your trendy diet and eat like a normal person" etc. I said that it''s rude to
  not respect my choices and that it''s also insensitive due to the fact that they
  can eat vegan food with no issues, but I don''t want to eat non-vegan food. Besides,
  there are places that offer both options and I don''t want to go to a fancy restaurant
  to eat grilled veggies and plain rice.


  They have decided to run the event anyway and organized it in a restaurant that
  had ONE vegetarian option and no vegan option - meat included in all dishes. I think
  this is really disrespectful and if it was meant as a joke, it''s a very bad one.


  I did not show up and left the facebook chat, and have not spoken to them since.
  AITA?'
