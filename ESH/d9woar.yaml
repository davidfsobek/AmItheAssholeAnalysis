selftext: 'My wife (29F) and I (31M) are both in school. We usually work on our homework
  in the evenings after our kids are in bed. We each have our own desks that are situated
  across the main floor from each other. This semester my wife is in two classes that
  require a lot of writing, and she often wants me to proof read her stuff and verify
  cohesion and adherence to the rubric etc, I have an upper division math class and
  a programming class.

  For the record, I don''t have any problem reading and commenting on her stuff, the
  problem we are having is HOW she wants me to do it.

  She wants me to get up from my desk, and sit at her computer to read her stuff.
  Personally I find this arrangement super annoying because she could just send it
  to me via email and let me read it at my desk. If she sent it to me it would be
  less disruptive to my work flow, not to mention I have a larger more accommodating
  screen (because I am not on a laptop), and I am often already comfortable in my
  chair. It is also hard for me to change gears from math, to English, and then  jump
  back into math (or programming).

  Tonight she asked me to read her paper, and I asked her to send it to me. She refused
  and insisted that I just come over and read it. I asked why she can''t just send
  it to me and she said "It''s only two paragraphs, why can''t you just come read
  it?". I explained that I would rather read it at my computer. She said I was just
  being stubborn and didn''t understand why I wouldn''t help her. I told her that
  I was perfectly willing to read her stuff, but felt that if she wanted my help it
  seemed reasonable to at least let me help her on my terms. She stated that forcing
  her to email the stuff to me was "getting everything my way", to which I replied
  "isn''t that exactly what forcing me to sit at your desk is? It is you asking for
  my help and only accepting it if I do it under your exact instructions. I don''t
  see why I have to disrupt all of my stuff and relocate just so you can get some
  feedback, to me that expectation is far more selfish than asking that you just email
  me what you have." She said "if you want to read it at your desk so badly why don''t
  you come over and send it to yourself."

  This went on for a bit and she kept returning to "you don''t have a good reason
  not to come to my desk," and I kept saying "I don''t think you have a very good
  reason to not just email me your paper, even if it is 2 paragraphs. If you want
  my help meet me half way!" She threw he hands up and said "fine I guess you just
  won''t help me and I will fail the class." I thought this was childish, and said
  "if you are going to act like this about it then,  I guess I won''t help you anymore
  unless your attitude changes."

  Edit: since it would not let me post more than 3000 characters, I had to whittle
  it down a bit. Basically this is not the first time we have had this conversation.
  She insists that the only way for me to help her is to sit at her desk to do it.
  Also worth noting is that on the occasions when I do sit at her desk to read, she
  gets up to do something else to kill time until I''m done reading.



  Second edit: there are lots of comments suggesting google docs or a network folder.
  To her these are the same as emailing so they are probably out of the question even
  if they are good ideas. Additionally, this is not an issue of me being lazy and
  unwilling to move, I do that frequently. That stance is, at very least, an over
  simplification of what is happening. I dont know why this escalated the way it did
  and I know it is stupid and childish but she seems to be set in her demand that
  I stop what I am doing, get up, and sit in her chair to read her stuff.'
