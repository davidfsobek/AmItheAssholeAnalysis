selftext: "For the past month my 24 year old niece has been living with us. I'll call\
  \ her Princess because that's what her parents call her most of the time. She is\
  \ a medical researcher (Studied medicine but wasn't interested in the practical\
  \ side of things more interested in the theoretical) and took up a position near\
  \ where we live, and my sister convinced me to let her stay so she can save money.\
  \ I was apprehensive because I know this girl has been coddled and babied since\
  \ she was little. \n\nWe have a 4 bedroom house. Me and my husband, my son (16),\
  \ my daughter (21) and our 4 year old rottweiler Freddie. I told sister that Princess\
  \ would have to sleep on the sofa in the living room which she seemed OK with, but\
  \ when she arrived both mother and daughter set about trying to convince me to clear\
  \ out the dog's room and let her sleep in it. Princess even said it would be OK\
  \ to make him sleep outside because ''it's just a dog''. It's getting a lot colder\
  \ now and I'd never let Freddie sleep outside. \n\nI told Princess that this is\
  \ where she'd sleep, take it or leave it, and she was and still is really sulky\
  \ about it, sulking about how we think a dog is more important than her. \n\nIn\
  \ all honesty I was right in thinking having Princess stay is more trouble than\
  \ it's worth. She goes out clubbing and partying a lot and makes no effort to keep\
  \ the noise down when she comes home in the early hours of the morning. Since she's\
  \ arrived the living room smells of weed and that smell definitely wasn't there\
  \ before she came. \n\nShe's also rude to my kids. My daughter got engaged and we\
  \ were all delighted, but Princess was lovely enough to say that if her BF had gotten\
  \ her a ''cheap'' ring like that she wouldn't even get out of bed for the wedding.\
  \ Daughter was in tears because of this and both husband and I had a word with Princess,\
  \ who then cried and phoned up her mother saying we were rude to her. \n\nHad another\
  \ phone call with sister today, and she still tried to convince me to put her daughter\
  \ in the dog's room. I made clear this wasn't happening and sister got upset with\
  \ me saying how nasty it was to value pets over family. I also said that her daughter\
  \ was skating thin ice and that I wouldn't tolerate her behaviour for much longer.\
  \ Sister was very offended and said we should be happy to have her daughter there.\
  \ Sorry but how can I be happy to have a spoiled overgrown child who keeps trying\
  \ to steal a room from a dog in my home?\n\nEDIT: A lot of replies here who don't\
  \ seem to understand the situation. I won't say too much as apparently arguing gets\
  \ you banned from here. Firstly to the people who have claimed I was acting snobby\
  \ about Princess's job. That wasn't the case. I wasn't saying that she was more\
  \ interested in the theoretical side of things so that I could say she's ''only\
  \ a researcher''. On the contrary, I specifically mentioned that she studied medicine\
  \ so that people understood that she had a well paid job in a selective intellectual\
  \ field and wasn't some lab assistant or something like that. She earns enough that\
  \ she could afford a place of her own if she wanted. She just wanted more money\
  \ to herself. \n\nAlso, the people who claim that I was being nasty to her because\
  \ I didn't like her and things like that. I don't dislike her at all. I was apprehensive\
  \ about having her because having known her since she was born, I've seen many of\
  \ her tantrums and seen her parents give in to them over and over again even into\
  \ her adulthood. I was worried about how things would turn out since we wouldn't\
  \ give into her demands. She has tried to pick on both my children when she was\
  \ a teenager and we went through a period a few years back when my daughter refused\
  \ to visit their home because Princess constantly bullied her. \n\nRegarding the\
  \ dog's room. There isn't any furniture in Freddie's room that a 24 year old woman\
  \ could comfortably sleep on, and we weren't about to go and buy furniture since\
  \ we didn't know how long she'd be staying. \n\nAnd for those who think I was trying\
  \ my best to make her uncomfortable, not at all. We tried our best to make her feel\
  \ welcome. Gave her as much space as she wanted and left the living room whenever\
  \ she needed privacy. We gave her food and while she brought more than enough clothes\
  \ for home, I went clothes shopping with her and was happy to pay out of my own\
  \ pocket. Within her first week here, Princess couldn't stop laughing when my daughter\
  \ told her what she did for a living (hairdresser), said that Freddie should sleep\
  \ outside and shouted at my husband because he hadn't cooked dinner quick enough,\
  \ so you can't blame all this on me. \n\nRegarding the weed and clubbing thing:\
  \ I've nothing against weed use. I smoked it a few times as a teenager, as did my\
  \ husband, and I'm 99% sure my kids have both done it at some point, but that fact\
  \ is it's completely illegal in this country. If she was doing it away from the\
  \ house I would not care at all. I wouldn't even have too much of a problem if she\
  \ was smoking it outside, but it is obvious from the strong smell that she is smoking\
  \ it in the house. I'm well aware that going out clubbing and making noise is what\
  \ most people her age do. However, this particular 24 year old doesn't bother to\
  \ take her high heels off when she comes in, and as we have a wooden floor we can\
  \ hear her stomping around in them which wakes us all up. \n\nLast but not least,\
  \ I didn't call her ''Princess'' on here offensively. I wasn't going to put her\
  \ real name on here obviously, and the fact is her parents genuinely do nickname\
  \ her Princess most of the time, and she doesn't mind it when they call her it."
