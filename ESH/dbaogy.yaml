selftext: "So I'm a university student. I'm the only one of my friend group who currently\
  \ lives alone (had a flatmate, he's currently doing a year abroad) so I'm usually\
  \ the go to host for parties. Honestly, I like it that way. I really do enjoy hosting.\
  \ Now, the rule at my parties is generally BYOB but I'll provide food. However I\
  \ have what I call the Orphaned Booze Shelf, which is where drink that gets left\
  \ behind and goes unclaimed ends up and that's fair game to everyone. I also usually\
  \ grab an extra six pack of beers, just in case.\n\nNow, I hosted a party recently\
  \ and shortly prior to this I'd been gifted some really nice beer from my older\
  \ brother's boyfriend. I won't bore you with a long ass anecdote, but basically\
  \ brother's BF is from Denmark and I went over there with the two of them last yeark\
  \ and fell in love with this one Danish beer. Very difficult and expensive to get\
  \ in the UK, but bros BF managed to find some and snagged me a case. For the party\
  \ I also went to the supermarket and picked up a crate of Coors bc I figured that's\
  \ a fairly safe choice for everyone. \n\nSo the party happens. Friend of mine brings\
  \ her boyfriend who I don't particularly care for because I think he's condescending\
  \ and snobby but I can tolerate him for her sake. This dude has a habit of showing\
  \ up to parties empty handed but whatever, we have the OBS and that for this exact\
  \ reason. I made sure to say to him when he arrived with no booze of his own \"\
  so help yourself to anything from the shelf, and there's some Coors in the fridge\
  \ that's fair game too.\" He says thanks, party's going great, we're all having\
  \ a super fun time. Then I go to grab another of my beers and noticed there seemed\
  \ to be more missing than I thought I'd drunk. I was baffled but thought whatever,\
  \ I'm a bit tipsy, maybe I've had more than I thought. But no. Again, next time\
  \ I come back, there are even more missing. I basically turned around and spotted\
  \ right away that my friend's bf had one in his hand. \n\nI went up to him and said\
  \ \"what the fuck mate\" and he sort of held his hands up and said \"you said the\
  \ beer was fair game.\" I pretty angrily told him that, no, I said the *Coors* was\
  \ fair game, the Danish beer is mine and it's kinda special. He insisted I said\
  \ the *beer* was fair game (I'm like 99% sure I said Coors specifically) and that\
  \ he didn't see what the big deal was cause he knows I like Coors too anyway. Plus\
  \ he'd seen me giving other people sips of the Danish beer so I clearly wasn't that\
  \ bothered about it. I was drunk and annoyed and basically told him to get the fuck\
  \ out and that he isn't coming to any of my parties in future. He left, my friend\
  \ went after him really upset. Tbh I feel most bad about upsetting her. Still people\
  \ have told me it was awkward and uncomfortable for me to go off on him like that\
  \ and that I should have done it privately. AITA for doing it there and then in\
  \ frong of everyone?"
