selftext: "I\u2019ll try to keep this short.  I\u2019ve been with my gf coming up\
  \ on a year November.  She has a 15 year old son.  When we first got serious I tried\
  \ my best to bond with him, but he had no interest in it.  \n\nA few weeks ago both\
  \ of them were staying with me and while she was at work he gave me a really hard\
  \ time.  He even broke a small statue I had (on purpose I think) and when I told\
  \ him to go sit in the living room he told me he didn\u2019t have to listen to me\
  \ and went outside.  When my gf got home I told her about it and she said that he\
  \ had a point and to leave punishment up to her.   \n\nSince then I\u2019ve had\
  \ the opinion that if I can\u2019t have a say in how he acts then he is 100% her\
  \ responsibility.  I\u2019ve told her that if she and him comes to my place and\
  \ she leaves she needs to hire a sitter.   I\u2019ve also stopped paying for meals\
  \ when we all go out to eat.  Instead of paying the whole bill I have it split and\
  \ pay for mine.  I don\u2019t make attempts to plan stuff he might enjoy as well.\
  \  \n\nIt\u2019s only been a few weeks but it\u2019s causing a lot of fights.  \
  \ I feel like I\u2019m just standing up for myself though and setting some boundaries.\
  \  She\u2019s right, he is her son."
