selftext: 'I am very self conscious about my weight. I am very skinny because of my
  fast metabolism and im very bony. It tears me apart when i hear people calling me
  a twig. I was eating lunch with some of my friends and the biggest one in the group
  said "Eat" when i was throwing out half of my sandwich. I said "Im not hungry" and
  she said "You have to eat, your a twig" they already know i have a fast metabolism
  because i told them before about it when they asked why i was so bony. I snapped
  back and said "I''d rather be a twig then a whole tree" and suddenly im the asshole.
  Everyone in my group of friends hate me and i want to know if its my fault.


  Edit: wow ok i didnt expect this to blow up. Now i can say my alt account has more
  karma then my main. I saw people concerned about my weight. My highschool has lunch
  very early and i had a big breakfest thats why i wasn''t that hungry. I just believed
  i was skinny because of a fast metabolism because thats what my mom told me but
  now im starting to believe it might be something else. I appreciate all the tips
  and concern'
