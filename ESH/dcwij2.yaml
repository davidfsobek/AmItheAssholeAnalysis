selftext: 'I keep a very clean apartment and grew up with strict parents when it came
  to cleanliness. We were required to immediately take our shoes off, change into
  lounge clothes, wash our hands, etc. upon coming home. While I''m not as clean as
  my parents, those rules have been engrained in me and I would say I definitely keep
  a cleaner home than most of my peers.


  Recently the weather has gotten colder, and my boyfriend has a nice waterproof jacket
  that he wears constantly. It''s that type of material that you don''t wash often,
  kind of [like this](https://www.sunnysports.com/Image/Product/Large/MRMMJMLRAN.jpg).


  The problem is that he insists on wearing this jacket inside, even when we''re cuddling
  under a blanket on the couch. It drives me nuts because when I''m home, I''m usually
  in "clean lounge clothes" and I don''t want to cuddle up next to a jacket that''s
  been at work, on the bus, thrown on the floor, etc. This type of material is also
  very "outside-only" typically so it''s hard for me to mentally relax when I see
  it on inside, kind of like seeing someone walk around with a backpack on at home.


  I''ve offered him hoodies to wear instead (they''re his hoodies, he keeps them at
  my house but rarely wears them), but he refuses and says his jacket is more comfortable.
  He says I shouldn''t be able to police what he wears but at the end of the day,
  it''s my apartment and I feel like I have a right to enforce rules that make me
  comfortable.


  He and I both love this sub so we figured we''d post our disagreement in here. So
  Reddit, AITA?


  Edit: I''m glad to see that Reddit is so divided on this! Thanks everyone for contributing
  your opinions.'
