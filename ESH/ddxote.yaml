selftext: "FINAL EDIT-First off, thank you for most of your comments.  This was a\
  \ huge reality check for me.  I completely understand and accept my judgement-I\
  \ was a huge ass.  I didn\u2019t need to bring my opinion into it.  For those of\
  \ you who slammed me for being political, I totally understand your point and will\
  \ not bring my opinion into matters such as this.  It was wrong of me to judge two\
  \ parents so harshly because I don\u2019t have kids, and therefore don\u2019t know\
  \ how things can go when youre faced with difficult decisions; and maybe this was\
  \ a difficult decision for those parents.  I didn\u2019t even think to separate\
  \ my harsh, judgmental opinion from my valid argument and that is something I plan\
  \ to reflect on and adjust.\n\nThank you to those of you who were able to call me\
  \ out on my shit without simultaneously making me *feel* like shit.\n\nFor those\
  \ of you who called my intelligence into question, and insulted my character and\
  \ personality-best of luck to you.\n\nThanks again, I will do better in the future.\
  \  If anyone has any further questions or comments feel free to pm me so I can respond,\n\
  \nEDIT: my new internet friend, u/FuckOffSupreme suggested I update my post with\
  \ this comment that i responded to her comment with:\n\nI don\u2019t think I deserve\
  \ a pat on the back, trust me. I respect and admire people who can convey their\
  \ opinions without sounding like a dick-im not one of them. The only reason i stated\
  \ that was as a reason for being so pissed. I mention this in another comment more\
  \ specifically, but my city is really high in terms of violence and homicide when\
  \ compared to the rest of the country. Thats why it makes me so upset. Why bring\
  \ a seriously, seriously impressionable kid to something that displays all that\
  \ freaking shit for literally 2 straight hours. And it makes the violent guy reallly\
  \ reaaally sympathetic dude and thinking about a kid seeing that and retaining it\
  \ makes me really frustrated and really sad. Kids are not stupid. Id bet money on\
  \ this film making an impression on that kid, and that pisses me off because it\
  \ was completely unnecessary for the kid to see the movie in the first place. It\
  \ pisses me off, and I did not mention it in order to get a pat on the back. Im\
  \ sorry for giving you that impression, i must have phrased something in my OP wrong.\n\
  \n\nI (23F) saw the Joker with my fiance (22M) tonight, the show began at 9 pm.\
  \ During previews, I hear a kid talking-clear childs voice talking about their \u201C\
  tummy\u201D.  I look at my fiance and go \u201Cdid i just hear a fuckin child\u201D\
  , he goes, \u201Cyep\u201D, and I respond \u201Canyone who uses the word tummy should\
  \ not be seeing this fuckin movie\u201D We were talking in a little quiter voices\
  \ than normal speaking voices.\n\n\nThroughout the film this kid is talking. Repeating\
  \ words theyre saying in the film like \u201Cpaycheck\u201D.  Everytime a gun goes\
  \ off, he laughs. After it happened 15 times, I say, somewhat loudly & during a\
  \ quiet moment, \u201Cthis is ridiculous\u201D.  Then, during a particularly gruesome\
  \ part of the movie, I turned around and gave the parents a look.\n\nAfter the movie\
  \ the Mom comes up to me blubbering about how I made them feel, \u201Cworse than\
  \ they ever felt\u201D and, \u201Chow could i so harshly criticize someone i don\u2019\
  t know particularly a small child\u201D. After she finished ranting I calmy told\
  \ her that I couldnt care less about her feelings and that people who think bringing\
  \ their 6 year old to a violent movie probably shouldnt procreate in the first place.\
  \  The woman didnt have anything to say but the guy looked like he wouldve hit me\
  \ if i wasnt a third of his size and a female.\n\nFiance told me I was a bit of\
  \ a dick. I guess I could have kept my mouth shut but I didnt care to. Kids these\
  \ days in the US are already so wrongfully involved in fucking gun violence, why\
  \ would you bring a child to a movie that (if you don\u2019t have any context) basically\
  \ glorifies it for 2 hours. I stand by what I said but, AITA?"
