selftext: "My ex husband of three years doesn\u2019t believe that our two oldest children\
  \ are his. He has been telling people this, including the partner of the oldest\
  \ child. The oldest has basically been disowned, and is hurt by by this. The children,\
  \ all adults, are all his children. The youngest child adores the father, and doesn\u2019\
  t know he is acting like this towards the siblings. WIBTA if I got DNA test results\
  \ and published them in a public way? In the local paper or on Facebook? This post\
  \ is a rewrite of a post to Advice. Thanks\n\nINFO: I did not cheat during my marriage.\
  \ Turns out that he did. He has previously accused me of the older children being\
  \ someone else\u2019s, I told him that he could set up the DNA test and I would\
  \ pay. This didn\u2019t happen\n\nEDIT: My plan is to have a conference call with\
  \ the children in a day or so (when I can get through the next conversation without\
  \ losing it) and just ask them what they want to do. Reddit is right. I would be\
  \ TA if I published, and although some kind of slap down might feel good in the\
  \ short term will do nothing for the children longer term. My thanks to all who\u2019\
  ve responded with clear, concise and cogent positions on this. Your input, positive\
  \ or otherwise, is appreciated."
