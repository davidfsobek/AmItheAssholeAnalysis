selftext: "I\u2019m 28. I had one miscarriage with an accidental pregnancy with my\
  \ ex 6 years ago. It turned out to be a blessing because my ex was verbally abusive\
  \ and psychological. I was pretty emotional about my miscarriage at the time so\
  \ I understand how heartbreaking it is. We\u2019re going to call my older sister\
  \ Julia. She is 8 years older then me and has a twin Peggy. Peggy has two kids.\
  \ They are miracles . Peggy had her first child and then 4 miscarriages after before\
  \ having her son. Julia was quite rude to us not really caring about our miscarriages\
  \ and making comments like get over it. All that changed until she lost her first\
  \ pregnancy.she never apologized for how she treated ya but wanted all the attention\
  \ and sympathy for her own miscarriage. Julia has one son who is almost two. She\
  \ has subsequently suffered 4 more first trimester miscarriages since then. She\
  \ gets pregnant almost immediately but can\u2019t sustain them. She\u2019s seeing\
  \ a fertility specialist who has done genetic testing. I feel bad for her. Everyone\
  \ has suggested to her to take some time off trying to conceive and let her body\
  \ heal. She\u2019s had two miscarriages since June. We recognize her losses and\
  \ reach our and ask what we can do to help her. Even if it\u2019s just watching\
  \ her son \n\nI don\u2019t want children anymore. I had the start of cervical cancer\
  \ so I may not be able to have any anyway. For some women this is a huge loss, for\
  \ me I feel okay in the fact I may not have kids. They aren\u2019t a huge want for\
  \ me. My sister has known this before she even got pregnant. I like having the \
  \ freedom to sleep in on days off etc. freedoms having a child would take away.\
  \ \n\nJulia came to visit yesterday. Julia has a very strained relationship with\
  \ everyone. She\u2019s very rude,condescending, pushes peoples buttons and just\
  \ acts ultimately that she\u2019s above everyone. She will come to your home and\
  \ rearrange crap because she doesn\u2019t like it where it is, or tell you your\
  \ shortcomings.  She\u2019s not above making weight comments or physical attribute\
  \ comments. I see her as little as possible because I can\u2019t handle her bad\
  \ behavior. \n\nYesterday she said something that really pushed my buttons. I lost\
  \ my dog and cat in a month period due to old age and medical conditions. They were\
  \ my babies. She said you can just get a new one. I told her to leave. I wanted\
  \ to say you can just get a new baby so she knows how her comment made me feel.\
  \ I\u2019m sick of hearing about her fertility woes and told her so.  Our one sister\
  \ is no contact with her.  She has no problems being mean to us without thinking\
  \ twice, but when someone doesn\u2019t give her all the sympathy in the world it\u2019\
  s an issue. \n\n\nAITA for essentially telling her I don\u2019t give a crap about\
  \ her fertility issues after she made a rude comment to me"
