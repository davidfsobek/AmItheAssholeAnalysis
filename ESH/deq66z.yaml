selftext: "Reposting with proper formatting\n\n\nMy friends and I were going to a\
  \ pretty exclusive night club in Manhattan. Now I don\u2019t do this often because\
  \ it\u2019s a pretty expensive habit.\n\nIt was a big group of us in total 6 of\
  \ us some guys and some girls. Now my friend Cindy joined us and we have been friends\
  \ for a bit.\n\nWe had been standing in line for about 35 mins. When it was our\
  \ turn the bouncer let two of our female friends through guessing it was because\
  \ they were younger. However for Cindy and the other guys they charged us a minimum\
  \ bar tab. Cindy then starts arguing with the bouncer saying that how come he let\
  \ our other female friends through. We try to defuse the situation and even offer\
  \ to pay for her bar tab.\n\nShe then says she is going to leave, and expects us\
  \ to join her. We basically all stay and she leaves by herself in tears. \n\nAfter\
  \ this she is angry with everyone in our group especially the girls in the group\
  \ that got in free. She has told everyone she can about what happened about how\
  \ we supported the devaluing of women.\n\nI don\u2019t think I was an asshole at\
  \ all, we offered to pay for her to get in, and I don\u2019t see how she can invoke\
  \ gender equality when she was perfectly fine with us guys having to pay the bar\
  \ tab.\n\nI would like to put this situation behind us as a friend group but Cindy\
  \ is expecting an apology."
