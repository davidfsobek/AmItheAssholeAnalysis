selftext: 'Okay so a little background info: My GF and I are both 26, we met in college
  and both have our degrees. She is the first and only person in her family to attend
  and graduate with a bachelors degree and she did it with 0 assistance from them.
  They have always been really weird(insecure) about it and often make negative comments
  about college/education in general. She worked very hard and is now a teacher.


  Last weekend we attended a family dinner at her oldest sister and BIL''s house.
  Their daughter(GF''s niece) just graduated high school and the topic of her attending
  college came up so my GF encouraged her to start taking classes at the local community
  college. Eventually BIL looks to us and says college is too expensive and is just
  a place for rich kids to party. Most of the family including her mom nods in agreement.
  I just say something along the lines of, "yeah the cost of college has become ridiculous".
  My GF adds that it''s also a great place to meet people and tells them how we met
  our best friends in college, to which BIL responds "you don''t need to pay $15 grand
  a year to make friends". GF insists she learned a lot in college and would not be
  who she is today without it and we move away from the topic.


  Later in the night we''re all playing an apples to apples variant game and the topic
  of college gets brought up by BIL again. This time he''s obviously been thinking
  about it and launches into a rant about how the most successful people never went
  to college, specifically Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, and Elon Musk. Saying how you don''t
  need an education to start a successful business(BIL has a window tinting/car wrapping
  business) and he how makes way more than my GF without a college degree, so it''s
  a giant waste of time and money. When he finishes I laugh at him and say "Are you
  really comparing yourself to Steve Jobs and Bill Gates? I didn''t know tinting windows
  was more important than teaching kids." He gets angry and accuses me of being jealous
  of him because I wasted my time and money on college. I said "why would I be jealous
  of your business when a 15 year old with an X-acto knife and a squeegee could steal
  all of your clients tomorrow? If college isn''t important then why do you need a
  degree to work at Apple, Miscrosoft, and Tesla? I guess they think it''s pretty
  important, also they did go to college, specifically HARVARD and STANFORD they just
  dropped out to start their businesses". Then I say to GF''s niece, "your dad''s
  right tho, you definitely don''t need to go to college to learn how to tint windows".


  All hell broke loose and now everyone is mad at me, including my GF. I feel like
  I am the asshole for mocking his profession, but at the same time I really felt
  like he deserved it and I am tired of them making petty digs at my GF and me because
  we went to college. GF thinks I should''ve just kept my mouth shut and I should
  apologize to him. AITA?'

  and "ruining" the night?
