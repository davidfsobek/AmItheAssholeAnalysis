selftext: "Ok so I know it doesn\u2019t sound great and I can already sense the people\
  \ telling me this story sounds fake, I know how it looks, but I\u2019m honestly\
  \ really upset about this whole thing and just want a bit of clarity. My boyfriend\
  \ helped me write this and we\u2019ll be reading the comments together.\n\nSo my\
  \ boyfriend \u201CBen\u201D has an amazing job. I can\u2019t get into much detail\
  \ as I don\u2019t want anyone guessing who he is or what he does but part of it\
  \ requires him to appear in YouTube videos every few weeks or so on his company\u2019\
  s channel. He\u2019s not famous or anything like that but the channel grew in popularity\
  \ throughout the last few years and people have increasingly started to recognize\
  \ him when we\u2019re out. I don\u2019t really mind, most people just want to have\
  \ a quick chat or show their support, not really any pics or anything. \n\nWe went\
  \ out to eat at this new restaurant we wanted to try and sat on the patio, right\
  \ by the barrier. As we were waiting for our food, this girl (20-something) walking\
  \ by recognized him and started FREAKING OUT as if he was an actual celebrity or\
  \ something. He was a bit taken aback since she was being super loud and he\u2019\
  s not used to having fans, like at all. Everyone was staring at us, but I thought\
  \ it was kinda funny and offered to take a picture. Afterwards though, SHE WOULDNT\
  \ LEAVE. We\u2019re talking like 25-30 mins of her pretending I don\u2019t exist\
  \ and trying to make small talk/explicitly flirting with my boyfriend. She was also\
  \ visibly filming the whole thing too (pointing the camera at us then on herself,\
  \ so I saw that was recording) Our food even got to our table and we weren\u2019\
  t sure what to do. I eventually just said something like \u201CHey I\u2019m sorry\
  \ but this is a special night out for us and we\u2019d like to eat our dinner alone\
  \ if that\u2019s ok!\u201D Which she ignored and kept hovering over our table. My\
  \ boyfriend reiterated the same thing and she just sighed and walked away. \n\n\
  She came back 10 mins later, still filming, and started talking as if nothing happened.\
  \ I told her to stop filming us as it was uncomfortable and she pretended to not\
  \ hear me, again. So I (aggressively, I\u2019ll admit it) grabbed her phone, deleted\
  \ the vids, threw it back at her and screamed at her she was embarrassing herself\
  \ trying to pick up MY boyfriend and needed to leave us alone. She started crying,\
  \ said sorry, and left. \n\n\u201CBen\u201D is telling me that I was a huge ass\
  \ because she obviously seemed to have some sort of difficulty assessing social\
  \ cues/situations, but to me it just looked like she was an entitled brat that wouldn\u2019\
  t take no for an answer. AITA here??\n\n\nEDIT: Need to mention that a few waiters/customers\
  \ told her to leave the second time after I told her to stop filming, and she ignored\
  \ them as well. The manager was notified right before the scene but got to the table\
  \ right when the woman started crying, then she left."
