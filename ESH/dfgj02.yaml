selftext: "I was born on a Res and lived there for most of my life until going to\
  \ college in a nearby state. In my community, we have a number of talented women\
  \ who are amazing at beading. They make some truly remarkable stuff. Caveat is that\
  \ they will only sell or trade to other people from the community, and possibly\
  \ another tribal group. It's just how they do it. \n\nI have 30 or so pairs of all\
  \ kinds and wear them with pride. Almost every day I wear a brick stitch earring\
  \ of some kind, it's just part of who I am, where I'm from, etc. Brings me a lot\
  \ of joy.\n\nAnyway a woman at work has really fallen in love with them. She compliments\
  \ them and examines them. No issue there. Lots of people do. One day recently though,\
  \ she asked me where I got them and if the person has an \"Etsy\" shop or something\
  \ where she can buy her own. This woman is white with not a drop of the heritage\
  \ in her, by her own admission. \n\nNow... personally I have no issue with white\
  \ people wearing the earrings! It's not about that. Wear whatever you want. But\
  \ the women in my community do not sell them to outsiders (again, for the most part).\
  \ It's just not done. \n\nI told her no, and she asked for the contact information\
  \ so she could commission a pair. I told her no again, that the person who makes\
  \ them is very particular about who she makes them for. She kept pressing me, telling\
  \ me \"Well let her make that decision!\" and stuff like that. \n\nI got tired of\
  \ this and told her, point blank, this person will not create or sell anything for\
  \ you because you are white. She got extremely upset and threatened to make a statement\
  \ to HR about me being racially discriminating.\n\nAITA? \n\nMy reasoning is that\
  \ if she wants beaded earrings, she can learn to make them herself, she can buy\
  \ them from anyone else (there are so many white women on etsy who make \"boho style\"\
  \ earrings), etc. She is merely upset because this one person will not cater to\
  \ her."
