selftext: "A week ago my sons school rang me and told me one of his friends had gone\
  \ to a teacher because my son hadnt bought anything at school or broughtq in a packed\
  \ lunch.\n\nI give me son \xA34 everyday for food so I was shocked. When he got\
  \ home I asked him what he ate. He said pizza. I checked the school menu and they\
  \ were not serving pizza that day. I knew he was lying. I told him to be honest\
  \ about what he was eating at school recently. He admitted he hadnt been eating\
  \ but begged me not to ring the school. \n\nHe was never overweight or anything\
  \ so I couldnt fathom why he wasnt eating and when I asked him he said it was a\
  \ diet. I also schedueled therapy.\n\nThe school can check what students were buying\
  \ so I rang up and asked if they could tell me for the next few weeks what he was\
  \ buying. I also asked if they could have someone make sure he didnt throw it away.\
  \ They said they would keep an eye on him. For a few days it seemed like my son\
  \ was eating but then he heard me on the phone and realised who i was talking to\
  \ and what about. He had a meltdown and screamed at me and said I dont trust him\
  \ and I am an awful parent and he said he will tell the school I abuse him (i dont)\
  \ if I kept ringing up. \n\nI promised him I wont but still rang up. I had to be\
  \ sure he was eating. I feel like I am deceiving him but is it for the best. I am\
  \ afraid he will do it again and I only want to check for the next few weeks.\n\n\
  AITA for lying? If he finds out I cant imagine how angry he would be.\n\nBtw hes\
  \ 15."

  it when he figured it out.
