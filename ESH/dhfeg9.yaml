selftext: "Note. My step-daughter, Madeline, was about a year old when I married her\
  \ mother, Jessica. Madeline\u2019s father died before she was born. \n \nMadeline\
  \ is currently 15, and she\u2019s rebelling for almost everything. She did something\
  \ bad, so while picking her up, I set a punishment up for her. Then she said \u201C\
  You\u2019re not my dad. I don\u2019t have to follow you\u201D. Honestly, I got a\
  \ bit hurt from that. But I understand that she didn\u2019t mean it, and that she\u2019\
  d probably change. I just replied \u201CI\u2019m still your legal guardian for the\
  \ next 3 years, and as long as your in my house, you have to follow my rules.\u201D\
  \ \n \nThat happened about 2 days ago. So our family was going grocery shopping,\
  \ when Madeline said \u201CI\u2019m hungry. I need food.\u201D I decide to be extremely\
  \ cheeky and say \u201CHi Hungry, I\u2019m not your dad.\u201D My son just started\
  \ to laugh uncontrollably. My daughter was just quiet with embarrassment. And my\
  \ wife was berating me \u201CNot to stoop down to her level.\u201D \n \nI honestly\
  \ thought it was a funny dad joke. And my son agrees. So AITA?\n \nEdit: I did adopt\
  \ her. So legally I am her parent.\n\n \nMini Update: I\u2019ll probably give a\
  \ full update later but here is what happened so far. I go to my daughter\u2019\
  s room after dinner and begin talking with her. \u201CHey. I\u2019m really sorry\
  \ that I hurt you by the words I said. And I am really your dad. I changed your\
  \ diapers, I met your boyfriend, and I plan on helping you through college. And\
  \ plus I\u2019m legally your dad, so we\u2019re stuck together. But seriously, I\u2019\
  m going to love you like my daughter even if you don\u2019t think I\u2019m your\
  \ dad. Then I hugged her. She did start to cry. I assume that\u2019s good."
