selftext: 'I''m a 26 y/o man and my friend is 26 y/o female, we''ve known each other
  since high school. She was the only girl that hung out with our group of rednecks
  and has always been one of the guys. So we were all going to a concert and decided
  to meet up at the bar, she was the first one there and I was 2nd so when I went
  up to her I said what''s up you fucking hooker was the corner already taken tonight,
  she said no why was your cousin and I didn''t think anybody heard but oh boy was
  I wrong. Some lady probably mid to late 20s came up to me and went off saying how
  sexist I am and that I''m a piece of shit for calling a woman a hooker and she was
  not being quiet about it either. So after her rant I told her that the woman I was
  talking to is one of my best friends so she can go fuck herself and mind her own
  damn business, she said it was still sexist and I''m an even bigger asshole for
  telling her to go fuck herself. I think that she should have minded her own business
  as it was clear after my friends response that we know each other. So was I the
  asshole here?


  I wanted to add I didn''t yell at the woman I told her in my normal tone that i
  was talking to my friend and to go fuck herself.'
