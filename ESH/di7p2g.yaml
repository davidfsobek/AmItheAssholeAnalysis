selftext: "Im not sure how to start this but appreciate any advice. Excuse formatting\
  \ as i am on mobile. \n\nMy husband and I have been together 3 years. While i am\
  \ definitely more ambitious than he is, that has never been an issue and i appreciate\
  \ his consitency to my crazy. \n\nTwo years ago i took a job in a specialized field\
  \ thay paid decently. At this point, i am earning about 15k higher than my husband,\
  \ but paying 80% of our shared bills (he has student loans and i do not) . \n\n\
  To put it llightly, i am unhappy at work. I work long hours, and then immediately\
  \ come home to cook (husband does not, but does yard work and laundry which we decided\
  \ was a fair trade off) and then straight to bed. I am exhausted.\n\nBy contrast,\
  \ my husband works a lower paying nonprofit job. He doesnt enjoy the work but they\
  \ pretty much let him do whatever he wants and provide him ample vacation time so\
  \ its a win. He could earn much more but enjoys the perks that this job affords\
  \ him. \n\nI am stressed to the max, and while i have been looking for comparable\
  \ work, i cannot afford to take a paycut of any kind which has crippled my job search,\
  \ as i work in a specialty and hiring has been slow here. When i have previously\
  \ expressed my frustration feeling trapped in supporting our family while being\
  \ so miserable, my husband tells me to go see a therapist (i do) and talk it out.\
  \ \n\nLast night i snapped and told him his therapist recommendations arent helping,\
  \ and that what would really help is if he got a job that took some pressure off\
  \ of me. For context, earlier this year he was promoted and told me he would be\
  \ helping me out more with bills, and then promptly put his pay raise into his retirement\
  \ and carried on status quo. He also does a job that IS hiring in our area, but\
  \ is happy in his current situation (which i genuinely dont want to take away from\
  \ him). \n\nHe got quiet when i said this, and left the room. I feel somewhat relieved\
  \ to have said it, but also feel like a complete jerk for having brought it up at\
  \ all. I don't want him to be miserable, but feel like hes not empathetic to my\
  \ side. \n\nReddit please give me some clarity, am i the asshole?\n\nEdit for clarity:\
  \ we have discussed this before and he shuts down every time, last night I was crying\
  \ and explaining why Im stressed and he was continuing to skirt the issue/not respond,\
  \ and finally said \"thanks for sharing\",  which is why I snapped. As for myself,\
  \ I have tried cutting back on hours and was threatened with termination for \"\
  being unavailable\"."
