selftext: "WIBTA-\n\nThis is my first time posting and mum thinks im being unreasonable\
  \ but would like to know if I would be a Ahole \n\nLil bit back story (me in my\
  \ 30s) found out around the same time my much younger sister (24) got pregnant due\
  \ in Feb next yr  and I am basically infertile PCOS with strong possibility of \_\
  Endometriosis so while im grieving my choice of wanting kids in the future is pretty\
  \ much taken away from me (as I pictured myself as older mum)\n\nBut not once have\
  \ I rained on her parade, I told her about mine doc results and notes, she shrugged\
  \ it off, but it is whatever my sis can be self centred and well being a first mum\
  \ I guess its expected shes excited \_for herself and I was for her, still am certain\
  \ degree..\n\nAnyho she already TOLD me that ill be babysitting if our mother (\
  \ soon to be Gran) can\u2019t, when im not working.. I was \u201Cerr ok then\u201D\
  \n\nWe found out its going to be a Girl which of course all happy about, I am such\
  \ a bow girly girl in some cases that I went out bought the little one some bows\
  \ for her when she gets to 3-4 years old IF she wants to wear one (cheap version\
  \ of Jojo bows) .. but my sis is DEAD against that idea, she doesn't want her daughter\
  \ to dress up in anything I LOVE and bows out of the question.. \n\nI explained,\
  \ well if you want me to baby sit can\u2019t I just dress her just for the day?\u2026\
  \u2026NOPE shes practically screaming at this point NO bows no fairy/mermaid dresses\
  \ NOTHING because that means shell be just like her auntie and doesn't want that\
  \ ( I love fantasy creatures)\n\nI told her that hurts I cant have kids so I wont\
  \ be able to experience anything like this formyself , would be nice just have a\
  \ girly day with my future niece, im not trying to be a parent its just have fun..\
  \ \n\nYeah she does not care its her word is final,\n\nSo I said ok then fine, I\
  \ will not be baby sitting, do no expect me to go out my way to change nappies (diapers),\
  \ clothe or bathe her I will not be responsible for her, you will just need take\
  \ her with you to do errands etc and I walked away..\n\nMy mother thinks I been\
  \ unreasonable because shes a new mum and I need to let it go and just sneak it\
  \ while shes at work or whatever, but I feel she being to petty for petty reasons,\
  \ not legit ones\n\nSo folks would I be A hole?\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\\
  ~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\\
  ~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\`\n\nNote: I will still bond\
  \ with my Niece when mum baby sits her (as she offered and so excited to be a Gran\
  \ that she happily do it anytime)\n\nIll never take it out on my Niece as its not\
  \ her fault that her mum and I have a broken bond for many many years ( we are polar\
  \ opposites maybe 95% of the time)\n\nAnd before I post I want to clarify by no\
  \ means I want to parent my Niece, im not very maternal right now anyways, I have\
  \ so much goals in my life that Kids/Babies RIGHT NOW are a no no\n\nSorry for the\
  \ length of it to and I hope makes sense, im so bad at typing/explaining"
title: WIBTA- If refuse to babysit in the future if I will be told NO on what my Niece
  will wear in my care ?
