selftext: "So my brother passed away in August, we\u2019re identical twins with the\
  \ small exception that he had facial hair and I do not, other than that we\u2019\
  re pretty much carbon copies. My SIL did not take their kids (2 and 4) to the funeral\
  \ as it would\u2019ve been traumatic to them and I totally respect that, however,\
  \ she has also let them Believe that he is me. I\u2019ve been at the house often\
  \ helping out with the kids and doing whatever I can with them and I feel as if\
  \ I am also sort of helping her in a way by not really letting them process that\
  \ I am, in fact, not my brother. She\u2019s caught onto it too, but won\u2019t tell\
  \ them and I Think it\u2019s cruel on her part to do that to them. She has to be\
  \ apart of the telling process but she keeps putting it off and I refuse to let\
  \ it snowball into something far worse on the children AND her. She\u2019s never\
  \ made any advances toward me but I also believe in her mind this is how she\u2019\
  s coping, by pretending he isn\u2019t really gone because she \u201Ctechnically\u201D\
  \ does still see \u201Chis\u201D face everyday. Would I be the asshole if I told\
  \ them that their dad died and it\u2019s really just uncle J helping around the\
  \ house?\n\nI\u2019m also concerned that at a certain point, I can\u2019t \u201C\
  reintroduce\u201D myself back into their lives because I look exactly like him."
