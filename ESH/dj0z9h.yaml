selftext: "So my girlfriend and I have a 4 year old daughter. She was unexpected and\
  \ honestly we may have been a little too young to have a child but of course we\
  \ are making it work. My gf and I have had a happy 6 years but not without our problems.\
  \ Our current problem? Her constant use of profanities around our child. \n\nShe\
  \ has also made it quite clear clear she doesn\u2019t care if our child says these\
  \ words. Of course I\u2019ve tried to tell my daughter these words aren\u2019t nice\
  \ and they need to stop but her response is always \u201Cmomma says them!\u201D\
  \ My girlfriends idiotic response is \u201Cthey are just fucking words!\u201D \n\
  \nMy daughters constant use of these profanities has earned her the title of the\
  \ bad kid in her class. None of the parents ever want to have play dates because\
  \ my daughter teaches their children the words. We are constantly having conferences\
  \ with her teacher who is also fed up with my gf. \n\nI\u2019m honestly incredibly\
  \ fed up! I have taken to calling my gf profanities constantly and when she gets\
  \ upset my response is \u201Cthey are just fucking words!\u201D My daughter is now\
  \ calling her mother profanities as well and she has told her to stop. My daughters\
  \ response when told to stop, \u201Cbut daddy says it!\u201D\n\nI just want my gf\
  \ to see how these words make people feel but I know it\u2019s very mean and I do\
  \ feel bad. I just don\u2019t know if I should continue this crusade or give up.\
  \ AITA?"
