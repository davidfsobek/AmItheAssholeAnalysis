selftext: 'Hi there! First post. English is my second language.


  My [26F] sister [32F] lives separately from our family and has been for about five
  years. We are quite close and see each other every weekend if we can (work schedules
  sometimes make it difficult).


  Ever since my sister moved out, she never really wanted to give me a set of keys
  to her apartment. I live with our mum and she has keys to our house. It is not within
  our family''s habit to show up unannounced or to go snooping through each other''s
  belongings. Privacy has always been a huge thing in our family. I normally wouldn''t
  keep it against my sister - not having a set of keys - but there are two problems.


  1. She invites me over often;


  2. She is chronically late.


  And I don''t mean 5 minutes late. I''m talking 30 minutes late. We would talk about
  meeting at 5:20 pm at her place for a girl''s night and she''d be there by 5:50.
  I''d say I can deal with that on an average day but last time... uhhh... let''s
  say I needed to use the bathroom. I needed to just let my guts go wild because clearly
  i ate something bad for lunch.


  And she wasn''t there by the time I was.


  I text her frantically asking if she has a spare hidden anywhere and she said no.
  I was panicking because I''d be standing with shit-stained pants if this situation
  didn''t get resolved. I kept texting her to hurry and come home to let me in to
  goddamn SHIT IN A TOILET and not into my pants while running up and down her street
  trying to find a place with a restroom. And then she texted me, go to a mall. The
  mall is a 30 minute walk (or a 15 minute run but who can run at that point).


  Luckily, I found a Thai massage parlor whose ladies allowed me to use their in-parlor
  facility. I came out looking sick and they even offered me tea ;;A;; I''ve gone
  twice to get massage there after that as gratitude.


  Needless to say, by the time my sister was actually home, I was mad. It was like
  six weeks ago and I''ve refused to go to her place UNLESS she texts me she''s already
  there. It takes about 30 minutes by car for me to get to her.


  My sister thinks I''m an asshole for overreacting and refusing to come over in this
  way. I''ve been angry about that and recently learned that her BF, who doesn''t
  even live with her as of now, has a set of keys and has had it since 2nd month of
  their dating.


  Am I the asshole in this?


  EDIT: idk if it''s clear from the text but the time it happened she asked me over.
  As in, I was invited to come. Getting a lot of YTAs and accept that.'
