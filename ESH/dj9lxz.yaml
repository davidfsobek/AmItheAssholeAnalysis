selftext: "I have a 27 year old stepdaughter, I\u2019ve been in her life since she\
  \ was maybe 5, so we are close and have a greet relationship. Her name is Joanne.\
  \ \n\nShe is very very much into the Instagram life (actually she has many followers\
  \ and goes a lot on brand endorsed trips etc) and unfortunately she has a Great\
  \ Dane that is little more than a prop for her instagram pictures. \n\nJoanne has\
  \ a personal assistant who usually takes care of the dog, but she is *very badly*\
  \ socialized. My step daughter is in love with this dog and doesn\u2019t train it/\
  \ discipline it whatsoever. I understand puppy love, but Joanne is on another planet\
  \ where this dog is concerned- to give you an idea, it chewed through $4500 of upholstery\
  \ in my stepdaughters car and she laughed it off. And she is VERY careful with her\
  \ belongings but because it was her dog it was forgiven straight away.  \n\nMy husbands\
  \ cousin passed away 4 years ago from an aggressive cancer that left her gone a\
  \ week after her diagnosis. My husband and his cousin were close growing up, like\
  \ siblings, and we immediately offered to adopt her daughter out of love and desire\
  \ to keep our niece close to us. She is 15 years old and her name is Charlie. \n\
  \nJo and Charlie are *so unbelievably* close, except for where the dog is concerned.\
  \ For whatever reason, the dog *hates* my 15 y/o and growls, stops her from leaving\
  \ or entering rooms, follows her from room to room growing etc. \n\nJo thinks it\u2019\
  s super cute and funny, despite her father telling her *many many times* that it\u2019\
  s an accident waiting to happen and that she needs to discipline her dog. Charlie\
  \ is terrified of dogs and reacts negatively too, which obviously sets off the dog\
  \ even more but she\u2019s a kid and is a jumpy kid at that- the onus is on Jo to\
  \ calm her dog down. \n\nJo wants to move in to our place from now- January because\
  \ she is massively remodelling her home and expanding. She\u2019s offered us a symbolic\
  \ (ridiculous) amount of $ to allow her to live with us, which is silly because\
  \ she\u2019s our daughter and she\u2019s always welcome, but I told her it couldn\u2019\
  t be a possibility UNLESS she takes her dog to obedience classes because the dog\
  \ is one day going to lunge at Charlie and that\u2019s just unacceptable. \n\nShe\
  \ said she hasn\u2019t got time to go to obedience classes, and asked if we couldn\u2019\
  t just take the dog and go ourselves. I\u2019m considering it, but my husband thinks\
  \ that we should tell her she can\u2019t stay unless she makes the time for these\
  \ classes. Charlie is terrified and has made it clear she would rather not stay\
  \ around the dog for an extended period of time whatsoever."
