selftext: "My ex-wife and I have been divorced for almost 2 years now. Our marriage\
  \ was falling apart for quite some time before she left, it was something I was\
  \ expecting. What I didn't expect, was for her to run off without the kids. \n\n\
  She ran off with some little 20 year old boy toy. They've been homeless for the\
  \ last 18 months, bouncing back and forth between friends and hotel rooms.\n\nAfter\
  \ 18 months they finally got a one bedroom studio apartment. since I've literally\
  \ done everything with the kids by myself the last 18 months. I figured it was about\
  \ time she took them for a couple of days a week, the kids have been dying to spend\
  \ some time with their mother anyways.\n\nI pretty much had to force her to take\
  \ her own children, there was nothing but excuses on why she couldn't have her own\
  \ kids. I had to threaten to take her to court for child support in order to get\
  \ her to take them. \n\nI figured I'd use this extra time to get a couple extra\
  \ hours at work, so maybe I could afford a decent Christmas this year.\n\nI got\
  \ a phone call yesterday afternoon from my ex-wife saying her ride bailed on her\
  \ and she had no way to pick up our kids from school. SHE ONLY LIVES 2 MILES AWAY\
  \ FROM THE SCHOOL!!! I told her she was just have to walk, it was literally the\
  \ only time she had to do anything with the kids so far this school year. \n\nNow\
  \ she's making me out to be the bad parent because I refused to get the kids from\
  \ school."
