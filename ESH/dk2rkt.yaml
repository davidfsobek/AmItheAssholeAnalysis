selftext: "Ever since we(27) had a baby, my wife had been talking like a baby herself.\n\
  \n\nRather than teaching the baby to talk like a person, it's as if my wife's language\
  \ has become baby-like. She would make noises in between conversations like \"Bo-dee-bo-dee-chooop\"\
  \ and \"Awowo-fwatata\", even when talking with adults. This is especially embarrassing\
  \ when I am with her in public places, when she talks like that to complete strangers.\
  \ \n\n\nI have been telling nicely to her to not do that but she would just laugh\
  \ it off, totally oblivious to how people around us stare whenever she talk like\
  \ a baby. I have to point out that she is not in the spectrum, just a crazy new\
  \ mum, in fact too crazy sometimes.\n\n\nIt was a day off for us when we have my\
  \ parents babysitting the baby and we finally have some time by ourselves. We went\
  \ out for dinner and she done it again, talking to the waiter, something like this:\n\
  \n\n\"Yippy thanks ya-ha-ha-hah. Owoyoyaya by the way can you give us an extra plate\
  \ for this?\"\n\n\nSeeing how the waiter staring at her as if she is some kind of\
  \ mentality challenged. I rolled my eyes and told her:\n\n\n\"I am taking a break\
  \ today and don't need another baby who cannot even talk properly to look after.\
  \ Please excuse me.\" \n\n\nThen I left the restaurant without her. I don't know\
  \ what occurred to me but I probably shouldn't have done that, but I guess it kinda\
  \ just snapped. AITA?"
