selftext: "RSVPs dont seem to be a \"thing\" here. You can send out invitations, you\
  \ can follow up twice, no one responds. Everyone shows up to the party and most\
  \ bring extra kids. \n\nI would rather not host any parties, at all, ever. Especially\
  \ when planning is impossible because no one can be bothered to send a quick message\
  \ to let me know how many might be in attendance. But my kid is turning 7 and he\
  \ loves this shit. It's his birthday. \n\nLast year I sent out 24 invitations, received\
  \ rsvps for 4 kids. 32 were dumped on my door step. The year prior was a similar\
  \ story. \n\nThis year we sent out 22 invitations with a request to contact me by\
  \ phone, text, email or facebook. I've sent a few follow ups with no response. I\
  \ have 4 kids that have RSVPd. \n\nThe party was originally planned at an indoor\
  \ playground nearby. The party place are hounding me for numbers and threatening\
  \ to cancel the reservation if I can't provide them. Fair enough. \n\nMy kid would\
  \ actually prefer to hold his party at another location. I had vetoed it because\
  \ it was way too expensive for the number of kids he wanted to invite, but for size\
  \ of the party that have RSVPd, the cost would be perfectly reasonable. \n\nI want\
  \ to cancel the party at the indoor playground, move it to the location that my\
  \ son would prefer and plan to take only the kids that have RSVPd. \n\nIt seems\
  \ like a pretty reasonable course of action, but I'm pretty sure that 25 little\
  \ kids will show up, gifts in hand, expecting a birthday party at the original place.\
  \ There will be no party. \n\nSo, AITA for making that the parents problem? Or just\
  \ move on and plan a smaller party with the kids that I have been notified to expect?\
  \ \n\nI don't want to communicate the location change to everyone, because the cost\
  \ would be extreme if everyone showed up. I also don't want to continue planning\
  \ parties for somewhere between 4- 40 kids because no one can be bothered to send\
  \ a damned text message to let me know if I should expect their kid."
