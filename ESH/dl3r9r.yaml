selftext: "About a year ago my son was born via c-section. There was a complication,\
  \ the umbilical cord was wrapped around his neck, and this was about a month before\
  \ he was supposed to be due. Everything is now good. He\u2019s a fine and healthy\
  \ baby. \n\nAfter he was born all my siblings and in laws came to visit, except\
  \ for my sister. I didn\u2019t really mind at the time since she was studying and\
  \ was about 2 hours away. But then later on I started noticing that she never really\
  \ took to my son. She barely acknowledges that he\u2019s in the room, never holds\
  \ him, and even once had a look of disgust on her face when he started crying. It\
  \ was a bit upsetting because she\u2019s about a year older than me and my old sister\
  \ while my other siblings are boys and a lot of my cousins growing up we\u2019re\
  \ boys as well. \n\nThen came thanksgiving (Canada) and we\u2019re all chatting\
  \ and drinking some wine and I showed some pictures to my SILs of my son walking\
  \ and running and the usual things since we don\u2019t get to see each other as\
  \ often. My sister has this big look on her face and just starts laying it on me\
  \ about how could I think that having a son was a bigger accomplishment than my\
  \ degree, that my son wasn\u2019t even a big deal, and all he does is drool and\
  \ do nothing. \n\nUpset, I tried to shrug it off and laugh because she must have\
  \ been really drunk right? Nope. She was dead serious. One of my SIL asked if my\
  \ sister likes kids. She said nope not a single one. Asked if she liked her nieces\
  \ and nephews. Only when they got older my sister started liking them apparently\
  \ and when they were younger, she just pretended to like them. So I asked her what\
  \ was it about my son that made her hate him, then I went on for about about how\
  \ I gave birth to him and I loved him and I loved my nieces and nephews. She cut\
  \ me off and said that I actually didn\u2019t do anything during the birth since\
  \ it was a c-section. I froze for a second as my SILs yelled at her for saying something\
  \ like that and my sister didn\u2019t care. She yelled back saying that she was\
  \ never prioritize her degree over a child that could barely hold its own head and\
  \ said she was never damage her body like that. \n\nI told her that she was wrong\
  \ and that the reason why she will never become a mother was because nobody in their\
  \ right mind would ever want to touch a cold heartless person like her. There were\
  \ definitely some profanity used and one of my nieces took a video. So now my sisters\
  \ pissed off at me, won\u2019t return my calls or texts and is now referring to\
  \ me as a breeder. My dad even said I was being a bit of an asshole and that my\
  \ sister was going through a lot. I always listen to him and his advice and now\
  \ I\u2019m just conflicted with everything since she\u2019s my sister. So reddit,\
  \ AITA?"
