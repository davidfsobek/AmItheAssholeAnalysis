selftext: "I have three kids, two boys aged 20 and 19, and a daughter aged 24. My\
  \ ex husband is still very close with us and we remain basically best friends. \n\
  \nWe all planned a vacation together to cape cod, but we sort of came to the conclusion\
  \ that we shouldn't invite my daughter Laura. Laura... she can be a mean person.\
  \ She is quick to anger and can be extremely demanding to others (especially aimed\
  \ at her two brothers) and sometimes even just a night out to dinner with her can\
  \ be hard to get through because of the way she acts. I just wanna give a quick\
  \ example, we went to my cousins wedding and had to sleep over my sisters house\
  \ the night before. My son had a blanket on the couch, and left it there while he\
  \ went to go make breakfast. Laura, when she woke up, looked at the blanket, then\
  \ asked him furiously \"are you going to fucking pick this up? You're just going\
  \ to fucking leave this here like some slob? Pick it the fuck up\" at a volume that\
  \ most of the people in the house could hear. My son doesn't even want to talk back\
  \ to her for fear of escalating her anger, so he just did it. Another example is\
  \ that my son left a pan in the sink to soak before washing it, and she flipped\
  \ a shit and started calling him lazy and a brat and all this stuff. Over one pan.\
  \ One time she asked my husband to do Yoga and he didn't want to, and she basically\
  \ started berating him for being unhealthy and making his refusal to do yoga into\
  \ this big thing. One time my son was having a migraine and had to cancel going\
  \ to his aunts dinner, and Laura just absolutely berated him and insulted him for\
  \ not 'sucking the pain up and going'. That is a microcosm of how she acts, not\
  \ only to them, but to us as well, and her boyfriends and friends. If she finds\
  \ even the slightest thing wrong with someone, she will point it out, viciously.\
  \ \n\nShe can also be funny and charming and talkative! She isn't all bad. But she\
  \ seems to have a problem when it comes to not being able to keep quiet over even\
  \ slight things she finds annoying. \n\nWe want to have a fun vacation. But the\
  \ thought of being with her for a week makes us all groan. It only takes one of\
  \ her 'attacks' at us to really dampen the mood, especially when she starts insulting\
  \ peoples characters and demeaning them. Me and my husband try to calm her down\
  \ and tell her she's being irrational but there's no point at all, she just aims\
  \ it at us and escalates further. \n\nSo we aren't telling her we're going. We're\
  \ just gonna go. Are we the asshole for this? For basically abandoning our daughter\
  \ to go on vacation without her? She would 100% be excited to go if we asked her,\
  \ and she only lives 2 hours away from where we're going (we live in nyc, she lives\
  \ in providence (but spends half her year in nyc). It sucks, because I do love her,\
  \ but I also don't want to ruin a family vacation. I keep thinking how much fun\
  \ it'll be to go with just the boys, and how awful it will be to go with her...\
  \ but also how bad it is to not invite my own daughter."
