selftext: "Not my story, but my brother's, and I'm really unsure where I stand on\
  \ it.\n\nMy little brother, is doing an internship with a large corporation. He\
  \ organized an internal food drive, in which the floor that donates the most wins\
  \ free pizza for lunch on a Friday. \n\nAt the conclusion of the food drive, my\
  \ brother called the pizza place on a Monday and asked about the logistics of ordering\
  \ 35 pizzas, on a Friday, during lunch hour. They said it wouldn't be a problem,\
  \ and to place the order Wednesday morning. \n\nHe calls back Wednesday, and speaks\
  \ with the same manager. The manager tells him they can no longer do the order,\
  \ as it's too big of an order to do during their Friday lunch rush. He recommends\
  \ my brother try the middle of the following week, and they agree on the following\
  \ Tuesday.\n\nMonday rolls around and my brother places the order, and uses the\
  \ corporate credit card to pay over the phone. The manager then tells him they cannot\
  \ have 35 pizzas ready at 12:30, but can have 18 ready at noon, and another 17 ready\
  \ at 12:45. My brother tells him that would work. When asked what to put on the\
  \ line for a tip amount, my brother responds $0.\n\nNoon on Tuesday, my brother\
  \ shows up at the pizza place, picks up the first 18 pizzas, and delivers them to\
  \ the winning office floor lunch room. Then, he returns to the store to pick up\
  \ the remaining 17 pizzas. \n\nWhile waiting for the second round of pizzas at the\
  \ store, the following exchange occurs:\n\nManager: \"Are you going to leave a tip?\"\
  \n\nBrother: \"No.\"\n\nManager: \"Usually with large orders like this you are required\
  \ to leave a tip\"\n\nBrother: \"You aren't delivering or serving these pizzas.\
  \ When we talked on the phone yesterday you did not mention a mandatory tip\".\n\
  \nManager: \"It's corporate policy that orders this large require a 15% gratuity\"\
  . \n\nBrother: \"That isn't what we agreed to on the phone yesterday. I'm not leaving\
  \ a tip\".\n\nManager: \"Well then you aren't getting the rest of your pizzas\"\
  . \n\nAt this point, my brother and the manager begin arguing, escalating to the\
  \ point of my brother's coworker pulling him to the side and recommending a small\
  \ tip (5%). My brother relents. He tells the manager he will leave a tip, but he\
  \ wants to choose the amount. He hands the manager his card, who runs it and hands\
  \ him back a new receipt for the order, with a 15% gratuity assessed ($125 instead\
  \ of $40).\n\nMy brother then gets into a yelling match with the manager, and is\
  \ escorted out of the restaurant by his coworker. \n\nIs my brother the asshole?"
