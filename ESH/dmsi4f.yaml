selftext: "My ex husband and I were together for 17 years. We have 3 children together.\
  \ My ex is an senior Vice President for a major company in NYC. He worked hard over\
  \ the years and we were graciously rewarded financially. Both of us work full time\
  \ and our schedules can often run late into the night, not to mention we both make\
  \ frequent business trips. This led us to making a mutual decision to hire a full\
  \ time nanny. \n\nInitially, we hired two young girls to take care of our children.\
  \ The \u2018nanny\u2019 took care of our children during the week and a separate,\
  \ part timer would do the weekend duties on the occasion that both my husband and\
  \ I were out of town. Our main nanny was amazing, but after a year, she decided\
  \ to take a job opportunity to better advance her career. We then decided to promote\
  \ our \u2018part time\u2019 girl to the main nanny role.\n\nA few months in, I began\
  \ to notice my husband having extra attitude with me. He was constantly taking his\
  \ stress out of me, which was out of the norm. I started noticing how his mood would\
  \ change when the nanny was around and I noticed how he treated her much different\
  \ compared to the rest of us.\n\nSix months later, he filed for divorce. Less than\
  \ a year after the divorce was finalized, they quietly began dating (SHOCKER) and\
  \ they were engaged and married within another year. We have joint custody of the\
  \ kids. They stay with their dad during the week, since he kept our old place, which\
  \ is within close proximity to their school. They spend weekends and most holidays\
  \ with me. We both live in the city still so it\u2019s fairly easy to transport\
  \ them from place to place. \n\nI have rarely spoken to her since they officially\
  \ hooked up. The only time I ever see her is when we swap the kids. When I am forced\
  \ to speak to her, it\u2019s usually a simple \u2018hello\u2019 or \u2018thanks\u2019\
  . It\u2019s always awkward but I cannot fathom humanizing this woman who played\
  \ a massive role in ending my marriage.  She\u2019s simply a homewrecker to me,\
  \ nothing more, nothing less. \n\nRecently, I\u2019ve noticed my kids have been\
  \ referring to her as \u2018Mom\u2019 while speaking of her and it has infuriated\
  \ me to the third degree. My ex and this woman are brainwashing MY children into\
  \ believing this be the norm. Per our divorce decree, neither my husband nor I are\
  \ allowed to speak of each other in a negative way towards our children. This has\
  \ been really hard for me to keep my mouth shut and not call her out for what she\
  \ is in front of MY children.\n\nAs I dropped the kids off Sunday evening, I simply\
  \ told her that she will never be \u2018Mom\u2019 to the kids, regardless of what\
  \ her and my ex try to cram down their throats. Monday morning, I got a text from\
  \ my ex cussing me out for my comment. He revealed that she\u2019s pregnant with\
  \ their child and that me yelling at her the way I did seriously upset her and could\
  \ have done damage with her being pregnant and all. He threatened to take me back\
  \ to court and attempt to gain full custody. \n\nWas my heat of the moment blowout\
  \ justified?"
