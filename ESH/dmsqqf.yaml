selftext: "My little brother is the single dad of a three year old daughter. He's\
  \ honestly a really good father, which is amazing considering that he's only 20\
  \ years old and the fact that our own father is a top drawer p.o.s. so he never\
  \ had a good example to learn from.\n\nNow I myself am just kinda indifferent towards\
  \ kids in general. I don't particularly like them, but I don't exactly dislike them\
  \ either. I'm not gonna go out of my way to have kids, but if they happened to come\
  \ along at some point I'd still be pretty happy. That said, I adore my niece. As\
  \ for my wife, she's mentioned she doesn't like or want kids a couple of times but\
  \ through her actions she seemed like her attitude towards kids was much the same\
  \ as mine. She's also never seemed to have any prior issue with my niece, though\
  \ she's never been quite as involved as I am with her.\n\nSo, the potential arsehole\
  \ situation. Last week, my brother got hit pretty hard and suddenly with some kind\
  \ of bug. He was okay on Thursday, on Friday he was spewing his guts up and couldn't\
  \ even keep water down. He and I are similar in that we rarely get sick and if we\
  \ do we get *sick* so I knew he must have been feeling like absolute hell, and I\
  \ didn't really want my niece to catch what he had, so I offered to have her stay\
  \ over at my place for a weekend so he could rest up and not risk infecting her.\
  \ He accepted, and I took my niece to my place that afternoon. \n\nWell, the wife\
  \ wasn't happy about it. She kept it together in front of the kid but hit the roof\
  \ after she'd been put to bed. She claimed she hates children and I knew that and\
  \ said she can't believe I'd sprung this on her. I was shocked. She's never told\
  \ me she *hates* children and has always seemed to like my niece. To make matters\
  \ worse she complained the whole weekend about my niece being there, even in front\
  \ of the kid, including going in a full sulk because I put a kid's show on the TV\
  \ to help settle my niece before bedtime (this was in the living room, we also have\
  \ TVs in the bedroom and kitchen). Took my niece home Sunday as agreed and my brother\
  \ was grateful but my wife has been cold with me since. Was this a colossal fuck\
  \ up on my part or is the missus being irrational?"
