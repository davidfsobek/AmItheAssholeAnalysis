selftext: 'I never had a great relationship with my brother mostly because of him,
  he''s 17 and I''m 21. He was a real shithead growing up, he would intentionally
  hurt himself to get me in trouble, cry when he didn''t get his way, scratch up the
  discs to my games and it didn''t help that he was a mama''s boy.


  He also has a napoleon complex, he''s 5''6'''' whereas I am 6''4''''. He is convinced
  the world (mostly women) is against him because of his height. I keep telling him
  it''s because of his shit personality that no one wants to date him or be his friend
  and not because of his height, I remember linking him that bagel freakout video
  asking if that was him to rile him up, It probably doesn''t help that I continuously
  make fun of his height.


  He also makes alot of incel-type comments on his social media, nothing too extreme
  but it''s still alarming sometimes. I mostly poke fun at those comments telling
  him he will one day regret saying those things, he doesn''t seem to get it.


  Anyways the past few months I''ve been distancing myself from him, I''ve been visiting
  home less, commenting on his socials way less, texting him less (not that I texted
  him that much before). Slowly until I cut all contact with him, I have no desire
  to have a relationship with him, we were never on good terms to begin with and these
  past few months he''s been posting way more cringing incel shit and lashing out
  at me more.


  I wish were cool but his behavior growing up combined with his shitty attitude+behavior
  now has prevented us from ever getting close, I know I have a hand in that but at
  the end of day it''s always been because of him, there''s a chance he may see this
  but I don''t really care anymore.'

  behavior?
