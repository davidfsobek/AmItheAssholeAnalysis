selftext: "Throwaway just in case. I'm (27) 16 weeks pregnant with my second child.\
  \ My sister (30) is a little more than 17 weeks pregnant with her first. We have\
  \ never been super close but we've always had a pretty decent relationship. We live\
  \ in different states (about a 24 hour drive apart) and only see each other maybe\
  \ 1-2 times a year. We both found out we were pregnant around the same time. I feel\
  \ like I've been trying really hard to let her have the spotlight because I know\
  \ how exciting it is to have your first baby. I let her decide when she wanted to\
  \ tell our family and then waited a couple of weeks to tell them about my pregnancy\
  \ so she could have her moment. I've been her support during all her appointments\
  \ and I've been available to answer all her questions and try to help her out as\
  \ best as I can. (She is in a healthy relationship but she's expressed that she\
  \ likes talking to me because I've been there before.) I've tried to minimize talking\
  \ about my own pregnancy because I really want her to feel like the center of attention.\
  \ I know how it feels to be so excited about something and then basically get shot\
  \ down and I don't want to do that to her. \n\nHere's the problem, though. My initial\
  \ plan was to make a public pregnancy announcement around 13 weeks. My sister told\
  \ me she really wanted to announce her pregnancy first so my spouse and I decided\
  \ to postpone and wait for her to announce before we did. She still hasn't announced.\
  \ I thought of a great idea for an announcement on Halloween and I'm really excited\
  \ about it. I'll also be over 17 weeks at that point. (For anyone who is wondering\
  \ people usually announce around 12 weeks.) I told my sister my plan and she, well,\
  \ lost it. She got so upset saying she was planning to do an announcement on Halloween\
  \ and I have to wait because she doesn't want to be overshadowed by her little sister\
  \ and I've already gotten to have a baby so her's is more important, etc. etc. Now,\
  \ I know a lot of this is hormones because she's usually a really rational person\
  \ and can discuss things with minimal emotion to come to an agreement. So I told\
  \ her I would think about it but I was really set on announcing on Halloween. We\
  \ ended the conversation with her telling me, basically, that if I didn't change\
  \ my announcement I was a bad sister and I didn't care about her. \n\nFrom my perspective,\
  \ I've tried really hard to make her feel special and not steal her thunder. I've\
  \ double checked with her before telling any family and I even waited to tell my\
  \ dad until she said it was okay. I don't want to \"steal her moment\" but also,\
  \ I've given her plenty of time to have a moment. So, AITA here?"
