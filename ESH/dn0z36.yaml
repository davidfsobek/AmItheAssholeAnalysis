selftext: "So I'm a college student and entirety dependent on my meal plan. I also\
  \ keep kosher.  They only put out the one kosher option twice a day and when it's\
  \ gone it's gone. So today there were three balls of Falafel left in the section\
  \ and there was a guy with a Cheeseburger. Eventhough he got there first I asked\
  \  \"excuse me, but since you don't keep kosher and there's only enough for one\
  \ can I have the Falafel.\" I also told him that he really shouldn't bring the cheeseburger\
  \ into the kosher section in the future and not to let it touch anything so it doesn't\
  \ comprise the entire section. He proceeded to yell at me how dare I assume he doesn't\
  \ keep kosher. I pointed out that he's holding a cheeseburger and wearing a crucifix\
  \ and  told him that if he eats the Falafel I don't eat lunch. And I told him he\
  \ should leave the food for people who need it. He pointed out that it's better\
  \ and that there's no other \nFalafel in the dining hall today. I took the Falafel\
  \ but he kept yelling at me for the entirety of the time I spent in the dining hall\
  \ and a lot of people took his side that I can't personally deny him the food from\
  \ the kosher section but it is posted as for kosher students only. Am I in the wrong\
  \ for taking the only food I can eat when he was there first.\n\nEdit More Info:\
  \ I've been campaigning for a kosher section for years and the school just added\
  \ it. The section also has multiple signs prohibiting students who don't keep kosher\
  \ from eating the food or bringing in food from other parts of the hall"
