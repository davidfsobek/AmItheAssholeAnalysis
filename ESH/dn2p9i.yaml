selftext: "I\u2019ve asked my friends, and they are genuinely divided, so I thought\
  \ to ask Reddit. I (31F) am childfree, and I work with Chloe (40?F). We\u2019ve\
  \ become good friends over the past year or so, and we hang out most weekends. We\
  \ are both into knitting and wine, and we are both really chill.\n\nIdeal friendship,\
  \ right? Well, she has a 15 y/o son (Braden), who is really unclean. He stinks like\
  \ rotting meat and BO, and he also has this awful metallic odor that makes me gag.\
  \ I know it\u2019s not a neglect issue, because Chloe\u2019s younger daughter (11F)\
  \ has never stunk. Lately, I haven\u2019t even wanted to go over to Chloe\u2019\
  s, and I don\u2019t want to invite her to my house in case she brings her son. \n\
  \nLady week was the last straw. We decided to go to the craft store together, and\
  \ Braden wanted to come. I drove them there, and my upholstery stank for a good\
  \ three days after. The next day at work, Chloe asked if I wanted to come over for\
  \ dinner, and I had to tell her no. She really pushed me for a reason, and I told\
  \ her her son smells like ass and I basically can\u2019t be around him until he\
  \ works on his cleanliness. She sent me a text later (pasted here): \u201CHi yall-need-weed,\
  \ the things you said about Braden were really uncalled for and I don\u2019t want\
  \ you to talk about my kids in a bad way. I am a good mom. Don\u2019t talk to me\
  \ until you apologize.\u201D\n\nAITA? Should I apologize?\n\nEdit for more info:\
  \ yes, I did unfortunately phrase it that way. We both cuss a lot, but I definitely\
  \ could\u2019ve been gentler. \n\nNo, I won\u2019t be calling the authorities on\
  \ Chloe. Their house is clean, he has access to washer/ dryer/ shower, this kid\
  \ just inexplicably reeks.\n\nYes, Braden comes with his mom to my house a lot.\
  \ He doesn\u2019t really have friends or out of school activities, and he likes\
  \ some of the gaming systems I have.\n\nEdit 2: no, I\u2019m not one of those childfree\
  \ people who hates kids. I\u2019m mainly childfree because I like the freedom, and\
  \ I\u2019ve never really had a maternal instinct. \n\nAlso, \u201CLady week\u201D\
  \ was a typo - I meant \u201Clast week\u201D. Fat fingers ftw!"
