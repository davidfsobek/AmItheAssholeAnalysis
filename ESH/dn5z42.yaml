selftext: "Posting this for my parents. And sorry for the rambling, I\u2019m just\
  \ trying to get as much information as possible out there.\n\nMy stepsister is 28\
  \ years old and has 7 kids (pregnant with number 8). The oldest one turned 9 in\
  \ September and still wears pull ups. My step sister doesn\u2019t like children\
  \ but loves babies. So, once her child gets to be about 10 months old, she just\
  \ discards it essentially and gets pregnant again. \n\nHer kids aren\u2019t in school\
  \ regularly and the oldest one is still in 2nd grade. She can\u2019t move on because\
  \ of truancy issues. Her mom doesn\u2019t like having to wake up early so if she\
  \ doesn\u2019t wake up early enough to get them to school, they just don\u2019t\
  \ go. \n\nIf you go to her house (which is only 3 bedrooms), it\u2019s a complete\
  \ mess. The kids don\u2019t have beds and they just sleep on the floor or the couches.\
  \ There\u2019s trash and old food everywhere. She doesn\u2019t cook or clean so\
  \ the kids live off of fast food, Little Debbie snacks, chips, and soda. \n\nThe\
  \ kids get their clothing from Dollar General, but she constantly has the latest\
  \ phones, designer bags, and name brand clothing. \n\nAll of the kids have very\
  \ unconventional names that will make both childhood and adulthood frustrating to\
  \ say the least.\n\nRecently, she moved her family about 3 hours away from my parents\
  \ and they\u2019re all staying in 1 hotel room for an indefinite amount of time.\
  \ \n\nIt\u2019s gotten to the point where my parents want to call CPS on her, but\
  \ if they did, she would absolutely get all of her children taken away. The only\
  \ thing stopping them is that they don\u2019t want to be stuck raising 8 young children\
  \ in their 50\u2019s and they know that if the kids were put in the system, they\u2019\
  d get separated. They are more than financially capable to care for them if that\
  \ means anything.\n\nSo, would they be the asshole if they called CPS and let the\
  \ kids get put into foster care?\n\nEDIT: I haven\u2019t called CPS myself because\
  \ I live about 15 hours away and haven\u2019t spoken to my stepsister in about 12\
  \ years (since she moved out of our family home). I don\u2019t know her phone number,\
  \ her address, or anything along those lines. Everything I know has been passed\
  \ along by family members who are still in contact.\n\nUPDATE: I shared this thread\
  \ with my mom and she\u2019s been reading everything as it\u2019s come in. She wanted\
  \ me to let everyone know that a CPS case has been open for a while on my stepsister.\
  \ The agent assigned to the case never does unannounced visits so my stepsister\
  \ always has enough time to clean and tell the kids what to say. The whole point\
  \ of the thread was to see if she should call the agent and tell her that my stepsister\
  \ moved her family (without telling the state), but she knew that if she made that\
  \ call, the kids would be taken from her since they\u2019ve been on a development\
  \ plan for quite a bit. She emailed the agent with where they\u2019re staying and\
  \ called the 1800 number provided since their office is closed.\n\nTo answer a few\
  \ questions:\n- My stepsister is married, but she\u2019s very abusive and manipulative.\
  \ Her husband has an old school Nokia phone because she doesn\u2019t want him to\
  \ have access to the internet. \n- Her obgyn has mentioned getting her tubes tied\
  \ multiple times but my stepsister refuses. It\u2019s gotten to a point where pregnancy\
  \ significantly affects her health and the health of the unborn child.\n- My family\
  \ isn\u2019t very close so my parents didn\u2019t know that her situation had escalated\
  \ until she moved closer to them about 2 years ago and they saw it first hand. \n\
  - My two younger brothers have children of their own to care for and I\u2019m very\
  \ much child free. Dispersing my stepsisters children amongst us would just create\
  \ financial stress and burden on us.\n\nThanks for all the feedback! I think it\
  \ was good for my parents to hear it from an unbiased point of view."
