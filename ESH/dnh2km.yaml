selftext: "Every year on our anniversary, my fiance and I wake up early to go to the\
  \ beach and watch the sunrise together. It's a very special tradition, as we have\
  \ both overcome a number of personal challenges during our time together, and the\
  \ symbolism of watching a new day begin is deeply meaningful for us. \n\nWe decided\
  \ we wanted to incorporate this into our wedding. Our plan is to have our ceremony\
  \ on the beach the and have everyone walk over to a beachfront restaurant for breakfast,\
  \ bloody Marys and mimosas (we've already talked to the restaurant owner about this,\
  \ who loves the idea and said he'd be happy to open early for us). After that, everyone\
  \ is free for the remainder of the day. Our friends and family are mostly local\
  \ and should all be able to travel to the beach in under an hour, except for some\
  \ extended family flying in from Canada, but that's unavoidable.\n\nBased on our\
  \ geographic location and the date of the wedding next summer, we've scheduled the\
  \ ceremony start time for 5:30 a.m., when there should be plenty of light but the\
  \ sun itself won't be quite visible yet.\n\nWe've been getting a LOT of backlash\
  \ from our families about this, who say this is way too early and we need to move\
  \ the ceremony to a more \"normal\" time of day. But my fiance and I don't feel\
  \ like we're asking for anything that unreasonable. AITA?"
