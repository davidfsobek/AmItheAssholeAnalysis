selftext: 'Unfortunately my girlfriend''s social skills aren''t excellent and as a
  result whenever she is annoyed at me she is totally incapable of expressing why
  she is annoyed, so she resorts to totally ignoring me.


  Yesterday at 1:00 we were supposed to meet up for a birthday meal for a good friend.
  In the morning I sent her a few messages saying "what time should I pick you up"
  and such, all of which went ignored. I decided to just pretend that she was asleep
  and I went without her. When I arrived I just made a joke saying "I think she''s
  still asleep", she hasn''t replied to any of my messages. At about 12:45 I got a
  string of messages asking where I was and what''s going on. I just played dumb and
  said "Wait, you''re ready? I thought you were still in bed or something??"


  I knew fine well that she was ready to leave the house but I didn''t want to play
  this stupid game and I don''t like the disrespect of being totally ignored like
  this, so I just decided to not pick her up.


  Obviously she was mad at me and had no idea how to express her emotions besides
  bursts of anger and then ghosting.'
