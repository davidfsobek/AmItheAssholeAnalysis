selftext: "Ok guys , I know I should've reacted differently, but I was appalled by\
  \ what that woman was teaching her child. \n\nFor some context, when I record I\
  \ usually wear pink hoodies and sunglasses. Not always, but many times.\nLast day\
  \ when we finished recording I was thirsty so I left the studio and went straight\
  \ to the supermarket.  \n\nWas buying some tea when I heard giggles next to me.\
  \ It was this woman ( mid 30's) , with her daughter pointing directly at me . I'm\
  \ kinda used to it as some people recognize me. But they were making fun of me wearing\
  \ pink. \nDidn't think much of it.  Let them have a laugh.  No harm done. \nFast\
  \ forward 5m , heard giggles again. Same woman with her kid.  Turned around and\
  \ saw the woman trying to get her kid to make fun of me because real men don't wear\
  \ pink.  \nAt this point I was blown away and sad for the little girl being taught\
  \ to be judgmental just based on looks.  But ok,  it wasn't my place to interfere\
  \ so, again,  I carried on with the shopping.  Guess who was also in line to pay?\
  \ Yeah  , same woman and her daughter.  \n\nNow,  I have a wife with some health\
  \ issues.  She looks really sick. She's skinny, blind from one eye and she's dealing\
  \ with depression and a severe eating disorder. \nIt would shatter her if someone\
  \ purposely let her know that they're making fun of her appearance, plus, we have\
  \ a 2yo daughter so I must admit I may be overly sensitive about that. \n\nBack\
  \ to the supermarket queue.\n\nThere she was yet again laughing at my face literally.\
  \  That's not what upset me. I was blown away,  how can this mother try to pass\
  \ on this kind of behaviour to her own daughter?  I approached her and said, \"\
  \  do you want me to buy something for you to eat?  Because tbh you really look\
  \ like a crackhead and that must be hard on your daughter having to see her own\
  \ mother looking like that. I noticed you laughing, are you high right now?  Tss\
  \ tss what a shame\" \n\nHer face turned red as there were more people eavesdropping\
  \ by now , but said nothing.  I finished with \" you know what,  real men might\
  \ not wear pink, but I'm pretty sure I would never teach my daughter to make other\
  \ people feel bad about their appearance\" . \n\nWas I out of line? I kinda feel\
  \ guilty for the kid but,  I honestly don't think I was in the wrong. AITA?\n\n\n\
  Edit: thank you guys for really letting me have it.  I agree with most commenters\
  \ . Also , great suggestions on how to handle it better.  \nThe one thing I don't\
  \ get is why some people doubt this is real.  Like,  it's not even a good story\
  \ and no absurd punchlines. \n\nhttps://ibb.co/P1TfQtW , this was what i was wearing.\
  \  I hope the link works."
