selftext: "Edit1#- wow this blew up. I'll take some time to read through people's\
  \ replies.\n\nMy gf (lets call her Jade) has been in the closet her whole life.\
  \ I completely respect her decision to not tell her family, she only sees them once/twice\
  \ a year and they are extremely traditional and have made multiple comments about\
  \ gays ruining marriage etc. Your typical homophobic old 'stuck in their ways' couple.\
  \ \n\nJade has had a 'boyfriend' for 3 years now. He is a devout Christian (no sex\
  \ before marriage) and spends most of his time away on business trips. I met Jade\
  \ 2 years ago and we started full blown dating. When she told me she had a 'boyfriend'\
  \ (she did the air quotes irl) she told me it was just to keep her parents out of\
  \ her private life and keep them happy. This was about 4 months into us dating because\
  \ i found a photo of Jade and Mark on the side and freaked out (obviously). Mark\
  \ has gotten used to me as a 'best friend' (im almost constantly around) and he's\
  \ pretty oblivious to our relationship. She never kisses him/does PDA.\n\nI know\
  \ she's cheating and i'm wrong for partaking knowingly but i love her and i do see\
  \ myself with her in the future. \n\nIll cut to the chase now you have some context.\
  \ A few days i got sick of the situation and told Jade she needs to tell Mark and\
  \ leave him so we can be together normally. Well she didnt take it well and told\
  \ me that she couldn't just leave him yet as she was accommodating her parents in\
  \ a couple weeks time. I told her if she doesn't tell him i will. \n\nI'm already\
  \ prepping myself up with what i'm going to say to him, but AITA for doing so?"
