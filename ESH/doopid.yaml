selftext: 'Long title, but short story. My close friend "Kate" and I are SUPER into
  Halloween. We love all things spooky and we get hype about it. All our friends know
  this, and we alternate throwing a big Halloween bash. As a result, during the week
  of Halloween, people prank us a lot, and are always bringing cool or spooky stuff
  to us, etc.


  One of our friends decided to prank us the other night by scaring us while we were
  out jogging, by jumping out in full costume with a knife. Obviously, we were terrified.
  Where I got so scared I kind of froze, Kate immediately booked it running, almost
  knocking me over in the process, and literally ran all the way back to her car and
  drove off. By this point, I knew it was a prank because our costumed friend was
  laughing his fucking ass off.


  She did apologize for leaving me, but she said she looked back multiple times, and
  I was never running with her (she did not). She also said she waited for a second
  when she got to the car to see if I was coming, but I REALLY doubt that because
  I could see her. Apparently, she called one of our friends first thing to tell them
  they needed to come to where we were and call the police, but that friend was in
  on the joke and told her what happened.


  Anyway, my feelings are really hurt about this. Not only did she completely abandon
  me, she almost knocked me over, and she drove off immediately. I also screamed her
  name and she didn''t even turn around. I get the initial fight or flight response,
  but to not even look back or wait even a second in the car for me to catch up really
  rubs me the wrong way. Our friends are split between thinking it''s hilarious, and
  thinking it''s hysterical. No one is willing to judge anyone to be an asshole. Things
  are tense, so I''m thinking of not going to her Halloween party this year, though
  that devastates me as well and I''m not sure how we''ll stay as close as we were
  when I know that she would literally leave me to die.


  **EDIT:** Just to be clear, I am NOT upset that she ran away. I know it''s a natural
  reaction to run away. I''m upset that she nearly knocked me over, didn''t look even
  once she was in the car, and that she immediately sped off in the car such that
  even if I HAD been running to the car, I wouldn''t have been able to get in before
  she took off. Even though she claimed she did. I know this, because my friend almost
  immediately revealed it was a prank, so if she''d looked back at us at any point,
  she would have known there was no real danger. I also know when she called my friend,
  which was well after everything went down.'
title: AITA For being mad at and (potentially taking a break from) my friend for leaving
  me when she thought we were in danger?
