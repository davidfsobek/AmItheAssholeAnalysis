selftext: "This story happened a few years ago and when I told this story to a newer\
  \ friend he called us assholes.  \n\nMy friends and I used to rent a house in a\
  \ downtown area that was on a one way street.  The house didn't have a driveway\
  \ so we would have to park on the street.  We could fit four cars in front of the\
  \ house.  The house was on the corner lot.  We generally never had any problems.\
  \  \n\nLiving down the street was an older (55f) lady named \"Gloria\" with her\
  \ adult children.  She had her own driveway but would occasionally park in the street\
  \ due to her kids parking in the driveway.  The problem began when she would park\
  \ in front of our house.  We had no problem with her parking in front of the house\
  \ but she would park in a way that no one could park behind her due to another driveway.\
  \  We could only park one in front of her and if someone parked in front of that\
  \ car they would run the risk of a ticket for being to close to the crosswalk since\
  \ it was a corner house.  We asked Gloria at least ten times to be more mindful\
  \ of how she parked in front of the house yet she still kept doing it.  \n\nNight\
  \ of the incident.  We came home on a Saturday night and she had parked like that\
  \ again.  My roommate and I were fed up.  So he guided me to parking within two\
  \ inches of her back bumper.  I guided him within two inches of her front bumper\
  \ and then we went inside to go to bed.  Seven a.m. she came and started beating\
  \ on our door.  (She was an avid church goer) I was greeted with a hail of insults\
  \ and that we needed to move our cars.  I said ok, shut the door and went back upstairs.\
  \  Thirty minutes later a cop was knocking on our door.  He asked us to move our\
  \ cars and we said sure and walked out to move them.  She was still yelling at the\
  \ cop about arresting us.  We said good morning to her and he just got in his cruiser\
  \ and left.  \n\nSo, are we the assholes for blocking her in and making her late\
  \ to church?\n\n\nEdit: I don't think I've seen so many varied judgements while\
  \ also agreeing lmao"
