selftext: 'She''s a friend of mine since middle school, we''re in high school now,
  15 years old. She claims she''s not homophobic (I''m a gay guy, by the way) but
  then also acts like gay and lesbian sex is the most disgusting thing imaginable.
  And she believes no one can call her a homophobe because she''s just having a natural
  reaction as a straight person.


  Tbh I''m tempted to tell her, the next time she starts ranting about her disgust,
  that I personally find vaginas gross because I''m not attracted to them, so I''m
  having a natural reaction. Before anyone attacks me, I don''t actually think vaginas
  are disgusting, well I normally don''t think about vaginas at all, they''re just
  a body part that doesn''t turn me on. The only reason I want to say this is to give
  her a taste of her own medicine.


  WIBTA if I went through with this?'
