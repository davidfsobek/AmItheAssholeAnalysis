selftext: "\nOkay so bit of an explanation. I'm on the train from London to Brussels,\
  \ it's about 4 hours long and I bought a seat in standard premier. Which is triple\
  \ the amount of money for regular second class. \n\nThe family next to me has been\
  \ unusual the whole route. \nThe child is watching videos on an iPhone 11 pro without\
  \ headset. \nThe dad is asleep and the mom has been on her phone none stop with\
  \ airpods in. \nThe kid is very loud and not being corrected so when she loudly\
  \ squealed I made a sound because it hurt my ears. \nThe dad suddenly got mad at\
  \ me and told me she was just a child. \nI told them if she can't keep it down they\
  \ should have booked seats in second class because we all paid a lot of money for\
  \ the extra comfort. \n\nHe started calling me names in French and now I'm doubting\
  \ myself. \nAm I the asshole? I have absolutely no idea how I should feel about\
  \ this and I'm stuck for another 2 hours.\n\nEdit: autocorrect screwed me over and\
  \ said squeezed instead of squealing idk why."
