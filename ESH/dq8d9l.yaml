selftext: "I have this coworker, let's call her Sally. \n \n Sally always gets off\
  \ work early, gets longer lunch breaks, and constantly makes excuses because she\
  \ had a miscarriage 25 years ago(older than me). I usually don't care, but I had\
  \ to finish a project all by myself, and I had to work overtime to finish it. This\
  \ cut into date night with my wife, Sally got to leave work 1 hour early, like usual.\
  \ \n \nThe next day, I'm pretty pissed. I was forced to work an extra couple hours,\
  \ and it cut into my lovey time. Sally starts to say her thing \"Uhh. I think I\
  \ have to leave an hour early again\". Then I finish her thing. \"Yeah, we know.\
  \ You have to pray for your dead child\". Honestly I didn't mean to say it out loud.\
  \ It was just something I was thinking. I felt so shitty afterwards. \n \nMy coworkers\
  \ surprisingly said nothing to me. Sally on the other hand called me an asshole\
  \ while crying. AITA?"
