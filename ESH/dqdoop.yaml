selftext: "Literally a shit post I suppose but here we go.\n\nI\u2019m a first year\
  \ in college and I\u2019m living on residence. On my floor we gotta bathroom that\
  \ we all have to share. It\u2019s gender neutral for some weird reason so both guys\
  \ and girls use it, they\u2019ve got no urinals only 3 stalls. Anyway so someone\
  \ on our floor seems adamant not to flush the toilet after they\u2019ve taken a\
  \ dump, and it stinks up for the whole bathroom that we all gotta use. This has\
  \ happened numerous times since the semester started and it\u2019s disgusting as\
  \ fuck. \n\nAnyway, so the other night I happen to notice a guy on my floor leave\
  \ a stall without flushing and sure enough his dinner is in the toilet. I get super\
  \ awkward using the bathroom with other people around so I tend to just wait until\
  \ other people leave outside, so he didn\u2019t notice me. I\u2019ve never spoken\
  \ a word to this kid and I\u2019ve only ever heard him speaking Chinese.\n\nAnyway\
  \ so I flush the toilet and decide to write a sticky note on his door saying \u201C\
  this dude is the guy who keeps leaving his shit in the toilet, please learn to fucking\
  \ flush.\u201D Anyway long story short the uh Floor Leader (and older student whose\
  \ supposed to like make sure we behave I think?) calls a floor meeting and says\
  \ that leaving rude notes on people\u2019s doors is not allowed and that whoever\
  \ did it should step forward and apologize. I didn\u2019t. Everyone on the floor\
  \ knows who the culprit is now. Should I feel like shit or did I do the right thing\
  \ embarrassing him?"
