selftext: "Throwaway since he has an account. I\u2019ve known that my husband has\
  \ been watching porn since he was a young teenager. I knew fairly early on in our\
  \ relationship that he watches it occasionally (although I didn\u2019t know how\
  \ much). I was pretty young and very sexually inexperienced so I didn\u2019t really\
  \ understand the impact it can have. And because it\u2018s so normalized, I assumed\
  \ that it\u2019s okay (or at least, not harmful). As time went on I began doing\
  \ research and processing what it could mean when he watches it and became increasingly\
  \ uncomfortable with it. I brought it up a few times in our dating relationship\
  \ but it always ended horribly. I\u2019m timid with brining serious things up in\
  \ the first place because he\u2019s a bit older and very intelligent, so he can\
  \ talk his way out of anything and I\u2019ll feel guilty at the end it. So I kept\
  \ my mouth shut while we dated and let my thoughts and insecurities run wild.\n\n\
  It should be noted that I\u2019m very confident in myself, I\u2019m not self-deprecating\
  \ or self-pitying. I worked hard to get to where I am now, so it\u2019s embarrassing\
  \ for me to admit that this makes me feel inadequate. To be fair, he did explicitly\
  \ say that I don\u2019t sexually please him and he\u2019s confident I\u2019ll never\
  \ be able to, so either he\u2019ll be a guy married to someone who will never fulfill\
  \ him in that way or he\u2019ll be a guy who watches porn on the side. It should\
  \ also be noted that it\u2019s not a big deal to him, so I\u2019m widely overreacting\
  \ from his perspective.\n\nI\u2019ve told him that porn is just about equivalent\
  \ to cheating to me, and that him watching it breaks my heart. He tries to be rational\
  \ in everything he does, so when we talk about it, he breaks down the logical implications\
  \ of him doing everything I want for him, which apparently leads to a sexually dissatisfying\
  \ life. To me, his \u201Clogical breakdown\u201D fees like he\u2019s blaming his\
  \ porn habit on my inability to please him, and when I defend myself and say that\
  \ it isn\u2019t okay to put this on me he goes to the other extreme. \u201CI will\
  \ do my best to get my shit together and not bother you in the process\u201D was\
  \ his response to me when I said that this shouldn\u2019t be put on me.\n\nI should\
  \ point out that I want to have more of a sex life. Because he\u2019s getting gratification\
  \ out of porn, he doesn\u2019t need anything from me, so we end up having sex very\
  \ infrequently and I\u2019m left hung to dry. I\u2019ve brought up wanting to have\
  \ more frequent sex but he\u2019ll just say that it isn\u2019t fun for him because\
  \ he has to wear a condom (I can\u2019t take birth control for health reasons) and\
  \ that he\u2019s afraid I\u2019ll get pregnant. Also, we\u2019re about 5 months\
  \ into our marriage, so I feel like lack of sex (or interest in sex) shouldn\u2019\
  t be an issue so early on, right?\n\nI love him so much and don\u2019t want him\
  \ to feel like he\u2019s on blast, but him watching porn is not okay with me. We\u2019\
  re going to counseling to try to work this out, but I want different perspectives\
  \ before we dive into it. AITA for telling him that he needs to stop watching?"
