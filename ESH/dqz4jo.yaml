selftext: 'So, my girlfriends sister(18) went home at 10am and realized she forgot
  her housekeys.

  Her parents are at work and so am i and my girlfriend.

  After calling her parents and my girlfriend to go open her door, noone could leave
  their work, so she called me.

  I don''t have her keys with me, so when i had lunchbreak, i drove home (25min) and
  then drove to her house (20min).

  When i finally got there, she said something like "omg you took so damm long, couldn''t
  you come earlier?"

  I was so mad at her being this ungratefull that i drove back to work and didn''t
  gave her the key.

  I was very pissed that i lost like over an hour to bring her a fucking key!

  Anyway, when i left work my girlfriend and her parents were very mad at me for not
  giving her the key.

  Aita?


  Edit: she lives in an appartement, so she was just outside of the appartement, but
  inside the building.

  And she doesn''t go to school or work, so she has nothing important to do.

  And i got here at like 1pm and my girlfriend opened her door at 3pm so she waited
  2 more hours because of me.


  Edit 2:

  Wow this thread has a lot more comments then i thought it would have.


  After reading all this comments, i feel like it''s 50/50, people hating me and people
  agreeing with me.


  Just to be clear, now that i though better about it, i too think i was kind of an
  asshole to her. I mean she''s a ungrateful bitch, but i am not the one who should
  get in trouble to teach her a lesson, she''s got parents to do it and if they won''t
  teach her it''s not my bussiness.


  I talked to my girlfirend, and she was mad at the beggining, but i explained what
  happened and appologized to her that she had extra work because of me.


  She knows her sister is an ungratefull brat and kind of forgave me already.


  Her parents are still mad at me for "being to hard to her little baby"'
title: AITA for refusing to give my girlfriends sister her housekeys after she's been
  an ungratefull bitch
