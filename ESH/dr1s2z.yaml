selftext: "So I was in a wedding yesterday. Everyone in the wedding party was to bring\
  \ a plus one, so I chose to being this girl I've been friends with for a while.\
  \ She also knew the groom, and a couple other groomsmen, but other than that she\
  \ didn't know anyone at this wedding, as far as I was aware. We kind of went out\
  \ separate ways while we're were in college, but we just reconnected a few months\
  \ ago, and since then I've developed feelings for her and I was planning to make\
  \ a move at this reception. \n\nHowever, about half way through, she went to the\
  \ bar to get a drink and asked me to go with her, so I did. On the way, I got sidetracked\
  \ by someone I knew that came to the wedding. I spoke with them for what was maybe\
  \ a minute or two, and when I turned around, my date was chatting with this guy\
  \ at the bar and the bar tender. No big, I'd just get my drink and wait for her\
  \ to finish and we'd go back. I waited and waited until it just felt awkward for\
  \ me to be standing there not doing anything, so I went back to sit at the table\
  \ and wait for her there. \n\nShe never ended up coming back. I lost track of her\
  \ from then to the end of the reception (maybe a couple hours) except for one or\
  \ two instances of seeing her and that guy off in a secluded corner talking. Both\
  \ times she was wearing his jacket (we were outside) and one of the times he had\
  \ his hands all over her as they were talking before walking a little further away,\
  \ so it's not like she was in an uncomfortable situation, evidently.\n\nAnyway,\
  \ this got me in a terrible mood, and when the end of the night rolled around, they\
  \ turned up the lights, and were telling everyone it was time to go, and she still\
  \ hadn't come back. I called her a few times, and texted her that it was time to\
  \ go and I was getting us a ride. I had noticed she left her phone on the table\
  \ at her seat, so I knew there wouldn't be a response. I ran one last check around\
  \ the venue looking for her but couldn't find her, so I got in my ride and went\
  \ home, assuming she was resourceful enough to take care of herself (which she was;\
  \ I asked and she later responded that she got home ok).\n\nSo am I the asshole\
  \ for leaving my date who didn't know many people at this wedding because I got\
  \ jealous that it looked like she was with another guy for most of it? We aren't\
  \ dating, but I was definitely working up to it and we've been close for a while,\
  \ so it stung.\n\nEdit: thanks for the feedback guys. I definitely know that there\
  \ were things I could have done to prevent any issues, so I'd say I can agree with\
  \ ESH conclusion. I'm meeting up with her tonight to talk it over, so hopefully\
  \ that goes well."
