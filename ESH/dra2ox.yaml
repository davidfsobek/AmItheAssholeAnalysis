selftext: "I\u2019ve been happily single for a few years and regularly go out on dates\
  \ from ok cupid and Tinder.  I had agreed to a first date with a guy that was otherwise\
  \ acceptable, he had a job, his own place, and an education.  He just didn\u2019\
  t have a car.  On a first date I always insist on meeting there for safety reasons,\
  \ so I wasn\u2019t expecting a ride from him.  But I\u2019m just not interested\
  \ in potentially dating someone who would depend on me for rides frequently, or\
  \ would be limited to where we could meet because of his lack of transportation.\
  \  If we did end up dating, I would feel obligated to offer him rides wherever we\
  \ went or I\u2019d feel like an asshole making him take a bus.  I also don\u2019\
  t want to be the one that always has to drive.  Anyway, I was honest with him when\
  \ he asked why I had changed my mind and he kind of blew up at me saying he hadn\u2019\
  t asked me for a ride or anything yet, called me a gold digging b!tch and a stuck\
  \ up c*nt.  I also don\u2019t think I owe anyone my time and could have cancelled\
  \ for no reason at all.  Am I the asshole for cancelling because he doesn\u2019\
  t have a car?  Am I the asshole for being honest about the reason I cancelled?\n\
  \nEdit: I knew he didn\u2019t have a car when I agreed to the date.  I cancelled\
  \ after I realized there would be issues due to transportation.  Public transportation\
  \ is lacking in my city.  He declined meeting at several places we had talked about\
  \ going to because it was far from the bus stop or because the bus schedule was\
  \ not convenient for him to get there."
