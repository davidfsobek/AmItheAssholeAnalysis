selftext: "I'm a girl in high school and obviously living with my parents. They're\
  \ kind of gross around food; they put open containers in the fridge with no lids,\
  \ stack stuff all over each other till something at the bottom is crushed or spilled,\
  \ they've put uncooked meat in Saran wrap in the fridge that drip raw meat juice\
  \ out.\n\nFor a while I'd not eat anything that was not from a closed package because\
  \ I didn't trust my mom to tell me if stuff was new and clean. She'd always say\
  \ stuff was OK and she just bought it even if that wasn't true. \n\nMy mom often\
  \ eats stuff that's molded and just gets rid of the moldy bit. And she and my dad\
  \ must have an iron stomach But that shit always makes me sick.\n\nI think all this\
  \ is because my parents grew up really really poor, having trouble affording food,\
  \ sometimes not having food so they're not ok throwing anything away. But now they're\
  \ doing good, we're upper middle class I'd say.\n\nAnyway, I'm so sick of it I decided\
  \ to deal with it myself. I bought a pack of 50 matching tupperwares, all with the\
  \ same lid size so my parents can't say they can't find a lid. Plus plastic zip\
  \ bags, date labels, bleach, and sponges.\n\nI took everything out of the fridge,\
  \ disassembled the shelving, bleached everything inside and out. I went through\
  \ every container and put the moldy things on one counter, and took the things that\
  \ looked OK in the tupperwares or bags with date labels estimating when they were\
  \ bought. I washed the outside of every condiment container with bleach water and\
  \ then put the clean stuff back in.\n\nPlus I hung a list on the door about food\
  \ rules:\n\n- All food in an closed container or it'll be taken out of the fridge\n\
  \n- All containers have the date of purchase on it or they'll be taken out of the\
  \ fridge\n\n- Any milk or juice that I see someone drinking straight out of the\
  \ bottle will be taken out of the fridge\n\n- Anything moldy will be taken out of\
  \ the fridge\n\n- Anything spilled in the fridge and I'll bleach clean the fridge\
  \ and the things in it\n\n- Anything taken out of the fridge will be marked with\
  \ a red X and cannot go back in. You can eat it if you want but it won't be making\
  \ the fridge nasty\n\nAnyway I did all this and told my family the new rules and\
  \ my parents got mad. My mom was mad that I'd decided some of her things were too\
  \ nasty to go back in the fridge because she wanted to eat them. I told her she\
  \ could eat them for dinner but they were not going back in. My dad was mad I'd\
  \ used bleach because it made the kitchen smell like bleach.\n\nAnd my parents have\
  \ been mad when I stop them with groceries and say I need to label them with the\
  \ date. Or when I took the milk my dad was drinking from the bottle and said it\
  \ was not going back in the fridge because that's nasty and nasty stuff does not\
  \ go in the fridge anymore.\n\nAITA for this, Reddit?"
