selftext: "Throwaway account for obvious reasons. \n\nI love my wife, but she has\
  \ to be the worst backseat driver I've ever met. I can usually put up with it for\
  \ a short trip to the store or an occasional drive up north to see the in-laws,\
  \ but after a while it really starts to grate on me.  \n\nLast week my wife broke\
  \ her foot after slipping on some ice and is on doctor's orders not to drive for\
  \ the next 6 weeks while her foot heals. I've been giving her a lift to work and\
  \ back each day, which adds about an hour and a half to my commute in each direction\
  \ because our offices are nowhere near each other. None of her coworkers live nearby,\
  \ so unfortunately she can't get a ride from one of them. \n\nWhat drives me crazy\
  \ is that she's constantly making little remarks about my driving, things like \"\
  you're way too close to the car in front of you\" or \"you're driving too fast\"\
  \ or or \"you forgot to use your turn signal.\" I'm not going to claim I'm a perfect\
  \ driver or anything, but I've never been in an accident and I haven't gotten a\
  \ ticket since I was 18. I never use my phone while driving and I always keep my\
  \ eyes on the road. No matter how many times I tell her to please let me drive without\
  \ commentary, she insists she's just trying to help me. \n\nYesterday, I got so\
  \ fed up with it that I told her she needed to find her own ride from now on. She\
  \ ended up having to pay for an expensive Lyft to work this morning and said I was\
  \ being a massive asshole. I think I was doing her a huge favor by going significantly\
  \ out of my way to take her to work and back and I shouldn't have to put up with\
  \ her criticism. AITA?"
