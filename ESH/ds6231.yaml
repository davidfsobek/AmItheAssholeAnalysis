selftext: "A week prior to my friend's 30th birthday, his wife called my wife to invite\
  \ us to a large birthday dinner with 30 other people at a restaurant. My wife agreed\
  \ we would come, but we are both strict vegans. My friend\u2019s wife assured my\
  \ wife that the restaurant had vegan options so I trusted them and didn\u2019t think\
  \ much about it as I was busy at work. \n\nTwo hours prior to the dinner I asked\
  \ my wife which restaurant we were going to so I could plan directions and parking.\
  \ She didn\u2019t know, so she texted my friend\u2019s wife, and we got the answer,\
  \ which I became suspicious of because it had the word \u201CSteakhouse\u201D in\
  \ the name of the restaurant. I looked it up, and I found out it was an all-you-can-eat\
  \ steakhouse with no vegan options, but with a complimentary salad bar.\n\nI messaged\
  \ my friend if he knew the price difference between the salad bar and full-menu,\
  \ and didn\u2019t seem to care as he said, \u201CI don\u2019t think you can just\
  \ get the appetizer bar.\u201D\n\nI then called the restaurant to inquire, and I\
  \ was told they have a fixed $60 entry fee + a 20% gratuity. I asked if I could\
  \ pay less since I would only be using the salad bar, and the hostess rudely told\
  \ me it\u2019s the same price for everyone regardless what you order. I did the\
  \ math (inc. tax) and I would be paying close to $200 for two scrap salads for me\
  \ and wife, and that\u2019s a lot of money for me.\n\nI was kind of mad because\
  \ my friend didn\u2019t seem to care that I\u2019d have to pay the full price for\
  \ just the salad, but also didn\u2019t want to offend him because it was his birthday,\
  \ and I have known him for a long time. So I messaged my friend and told him I would\
  \ not be coming because I felt uncomfortable paying $200 for two scrap salads, but\
  \ I would make it to him by taking him and his wife out for dinner the following\
  \ weekend on my expense, and to the Joker movie afterwards. I know it was irresponsible\
  \ for me not to check the restaurant beforehand, but his wife assured my wife that\
  \ there would be vegan options. I was so busy at work I trusted them on their word.\n\
  \nMy friend never even responded back to my message, so my wife messaged his wife\
  \ that we wouldn\u2019t be coming and we were very sorry and would make it up to\
  \ them the following weekend. She never responded to my wife either. The next day\
  \ his wife rudely messaged my wife saying how terrible I was for not coming. It\u2019\
  s now been more than a month since then, and I haven\u2019t heard from him. My parents\
  \ spoke to him, and he\u2019s still extremely mad at me, claiming his 30th birthday\
  \ was very important and he wanted me there. My parents think I was wrong for cancelling\
  \ last minute and I should apologize to him. However I feel I didn\u2019t do anything\
  \ wrong and I feel he\u2019s being very unreasonable. \n\nAITA?"
