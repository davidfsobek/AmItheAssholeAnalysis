selftext: "Ok so about 2 months ago he(26M) lost his job. We were planning on changing\
  \ states and our lease was ending, so decided to move states as opposed to sticking\
  \ around for another year or two as we were planning. \n\nSince then, I (30F) fronted\
  \ all the costs. The movers, meals out, groceries, you name it. He pulled from his\
  \ savings and we are roughly even at this point, 1 month after move in. I pay for\
  \ all fun expenses (activities, groceries, dinners out, etc) but he def paid half\
  \ the rent this month from savings. \n\nWe love snow sports. Within the last two\
  \ weeks, hes bought new boots and pants totaling about $600. We needed them to be\
  \ able to go so I was okay with it. \n\nYesterday I lost it. still with no job,\
  \ with me as the only prospect of supporting us until he has one, he cashed in credit\
  \ card points and bought a pink snowboarding jacket because it was cooler than the\
  \ one he currently has. He owns a perfectly functional and kind of cool looking\
  \ one. \n\nI get it - it's free rewards earned from his spending. His to do as he\
  \ pleases right?\n\nMy argument- what if his unemployment lasts longer than these\
  \ two months? His savings is dwindling. I know hes under $4k at this point. Who\
  \ will make his car payment in a few months if he doesn't get a job? Or why not\
  \ spend that money on entertainment instead of just expecting me to pay? Why not\
  \ help out on groceries?"
