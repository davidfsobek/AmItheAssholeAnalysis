selftext: "I\u2019m an only child, but my parents take in foster children quite often.\
  \ They only take in females from the ages of 10-17. I am a girl as well, I am 16.\n\
  \nWe have a new girl staying with us, let\u2019s call her Jane, she has been with\
  \ us for over a month. Jane is very loud and annoying, she doesn\u2019t follow rules\
  \ and talks back to my parents. I have been getting annoyed lately because my parents\
  \ are letting Jane get away with stuff that they never would let me get away with,\
  \ and to make matters worse I caught her trying to go into my bedroom (we have locks\
  \ on all of the doors so she couldn\u2019t get in).Jane is also always teasing me,\
  \ calling me lanky, making fun of my hair, and even making fun of my parents. I\
  \ really dislike her.\n\nJane and I have the same lunch at school. As I\u2019m getting\
  \ my food, I see her point to me and laugh as she is talking to a group of girls.\
  \ I am a confrontational person, so I went to sit near them to see if she would\
  \ continue to talk about me to these girls in front of my face. Well she did. She\
  \ kept talking about my house, my family and me.\n\nEventually I had enough and\
  \ said \u2018\u201Cat least I\u2019m not a fat loser who\u2019s parents didn\u2019\
  t even want them\u201D.\n\nI know what I said was mean, but she has been teasing\
  \ me since she got here.\n\nWell, she started crying, and called my parents to tell\
  \ them what I said.\n\nThey grounded me, and I don\u2019t think what I did was wrong\
  \ as even though It\u2019s mean, i was standing up to a bully.\n\nWITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\
  \nETA:\n\njust  responding to a few things:\n\nMy parents do correct Jane, they\
  \ punish her for being mean to me, but they make her do chores, copy out of the\
  \ dictionary, write \u201CI will not....\u201D over and over. For me that just take\
  \ privliges, and the stuff I. They take my phone, and take my computer out of my\
  \ room.\n\nWe have had locks on our door since we started getting fosters, it\u2019\
  s not due to her, but I still do not know why she was trying to enter my room. \
  \  \n\n\nI do not mind most of the placements that we get, I am still friends with\
  \ many of them, and my parents keep in touch with most of them."
