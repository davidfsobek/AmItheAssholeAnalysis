selftext: "My parents died when I was 23 and whilst they weren't extremely rich, they\
  \ had a couple of properties and shares. I ended up selling the family home and\
  \ buying myself a flat in the city centre and then invested the rest of the money.\
  \ I receive a quarterly cheque that would allow me to live a very comfortable life,\
  \ but I mainly save it and live off my salary. \n\nI've been dating a girl for 2\
  \ years and we've discussed living together and I was more than happy for her to\
  \ move in with me, I explained that I owned the place but I never disclosed that\
  \ I'd inherited money from my parents and received an income other than my salary.\
  \ All I said at the time was that I'd inherited the flat from my parents. The going\
  \ rate for an en-suite large bedroom in the area is about \xA31,200 so we agreed\
  \ on \xA3600 a month which would cover everything including bills. \n\nWe've been\
  \ living together for 4 months now and it seems to be going very well, we each have\
  \ our own rooms but we frequently sleep over with each other and share the living\
  \ space. I also have a small 3rd bedroom that I use as my office as I sometimes\
  \ work from home. Whilst the income from my rental properties are paid directly\
  \ into my bank, the dividends from shares are received by physical cheque and the\
  \ estate agent sends me a quarterly update as I like having physical copies of my\
  \ accounts. \n\nLast week my GF was using my office and came across one of the dividend\
  \ cheques I hadn't cashed yet. This led her to snoop around and she essentially\
  \ went through my file cabinet and found everything. She confronted me about this\
  \ and we got into an argument where she was angry that I'd hidden this all from\
  \ her and that I was profiting off her \"rent\" when she needed the money more than\
  \ I did. \n\nAITA for never telling her about my money and not letting her live\
  \ her for free?\n\nINFO: The monthly bills for the house (electricity, water, internet\
  \ and service charge) comes to about \xA3300, I do all the food shopping and cooking\
  \ which is about \xA3250 a month and I also pay for her phone, subscriptions (Netflix,\
  \ Spotify etc.) which is about another \xA3100 a month."
