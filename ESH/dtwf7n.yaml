selftext: 'This happened at my FAVORITE Ramen place or at least it used to be. I had
  a really bad experience. We were in a group of four. Everything is normal, we take
  our orders, nothing out of the ordinary, my two friends order a bowl of soup and
  a drink each Plus a Spicy chicken Karage. I order a bowl of soup and a tea. My GF
  orders an order of Steamed rice, Tempura and non-spicy chicken karage. They confirm
  the order and its all good.


  We chat and wait for the food. drinks come. spicy Karage comes out. then the rice...
  few mins later the two soups for my friends. Its not out of the ordinary for stuff
  to come not together so i wait a bit longer. My group of friends like to chat so
  we do so and more time goes by. We are still waiting on my soup and my spouses Chicken(her
  main part of meal).


  We flag down a waitress and she confirms what we ordered, she even brought out the
  sheet of paper the original waitress used to take down our order. We confirm the
  items that are missing. and she goes off to what we assume to check on our food.
  We are already hungry and a bit upset.


  Another 10 mins go by. My two other friends are 80-90% done their soup. We ask again
  where our food is. Our food was not ordered for the 2nd time. We went full "Karen"
  and asked for a manager. We are pissed and hangry.


  My spouse was left with cold rice and tempura with no chicken. I was left with cold
  tea. The manager offered to comp the food that was not there. We declined and asked
  our friends food to be comped. They kept on trying to make excuses for the mistake.
  blaming it on each other. there was NO ownership of the mistake, no remorse. it
  was almost as they were just robots spitting out excuses. while the conversation
  is happening our food finally arrives. but it was already too late.. Their offer
  didn''t change. So we stood up and left. I understand that the staff will probably
  have to cover the cost of the food. but this was unacceptable. Am I the asshole
  for not getting my soup?


  EDIT: Friends did not pay for their food either, but i told them we are leaving.
  Its a Ramen Joint, so once food is on the table, you eat because no one likes cold
  food. For people saying it was a Dine and Dash: Its not like it was a suprise that
  we left. We told them we were leaving. We didn''t run out the door expecting a free
  meal from the start.'
