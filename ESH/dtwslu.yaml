selftext: "Sorry this will be a bit long. \nMy ex and I have a child together, he\u2019\
  s one. Shortly after son was born, ex relapsed on drugs. Ex ended up going to rehab\
  \ when son was about 7 months old, and I was given full custody, with supervised\
  \ visitation which my mom takes my son to \n\nMy son and I live with my parents,\
  \ at this point in his life she has already missed many milestones, but that\u2019\
  s just the price she paid. \n\nAfter two months of rehab she moved into a half way\
  \ house, she could now have a cellphone. She had been asking me to send an insane\
  \ amount of pictures and video of our kid.\n\nShe wanted videos of him eating, videos\
  \ of him sleeping, pictures of him just doing normal baby shit. At first I complied\
  \ and was sending over 30 videos and pictures to her each day. Eventually I put\
  \ my foot down and told her that she was getting ONE picture of son per day, and\
  \ maybe a couple videos a week when he is doing something interesting. \n\nOf course\
  \ this started a shit storm, ex went public with my text to her, started trying\
  \ to shame me on social media for \u201Ckicking her while she\u2019s down\u201D\
  \ and refusing to let her see son. With half the story in mind, I got rained down\
  \ on my my family for not being fair to my ex until I explained the situation. \n\
  \nSo I stop sending pictures all together, and I block ex\u2019s number, I also\
  \ reduce visitation to one time per month, as that is something that I can do. My\
  \ mom sends her pictures occasionally. \n\nI started dating someone recently, and\
  \ ex found out. It has been drama drama drama since then, ex even called cps because\
  \ son had a bout of thrush. During this time sons birthday was coming up, I told\
  \ ex that she is not allowed to come to sons birthday party. I had invited her previously.\
  \ It was a very small party, my current partner was there. I really wanted it so\
  \ just go smoothly, so I changed the date and location without telling her. \n\n\
  Ex has been lambasting me on social media for about two weeks since the party, some\
  \ members of my family don\u2019t think I did the right thing, and honestly I feel\
  \ bad. AITA?"
