selftext: "First off I agree with everyone that I am the asshole for reading the journal\
  \ in the first place, lately she has been really distant from me like not even talking\
  \ to me for entire days. So that being said I decided to read her journal since\
  \ she wouldn\u2019t tell me what was wrong. I know it\u2019s wrong. Long story short\
  \ in the entry for today she talks about how she enjoys living with me and her family\
  \ but feels a little out of place. Later in she talks about how she doesn\u2019\
  t like me anymore. But she stays with me so she has a place to live. Says that I\
  \ show red flags and I am manipulating her to stay, honestly I want the best for\
  \ this girl, I know places she can stay and people have offered her places to stay\
  \ permanently. I don\u2019t know what red flags she\u2019s talking about she never\
  \ brings up anything negative so I don\u2019t know what to fix. The next part is\
  \ what got me mad sad and everything else even more it\u2019s the fact that she\
  \ admits to liking another guy and how she\u2019s give up everything to be with\
  \ him. She\u2019s always told me that she never liked the guy like that and they\
  \ were just mutual friends. So now to the point of the post would I be the asshole\
  \ if I confront her tonight about what is in her journal?\n\nEdit: For everyone\
  \ saying that the red flag is the fact I read her journal, I agree that is a red\
  \ flag but this is the first time that I have done something like that so it\u2019\
  s not the red flags she I referring to in the journal.\n\nAlso she is not tied to\
  \ a lease or anything so she is free to leave with no legal reason stopping her."
