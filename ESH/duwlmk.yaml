selftext: "Throwaway because some of my family knows my account \n\nMy family loves\
  \ taking group photos and takes them A LOT. In the past, my girlfriend was excluded\
  \ from the photo or relegated as the photo taker. She and I didn't mind back then\
  \ because she hadn't been in the family too long but now we've been together for\
  \ almost 4 years. As of about last year, she's been included in every family photo\
  \ and is really a part of the family. My sister's (let's call her Kelly) bf (let's\
  \ call him Bob) got the job of photo taker when they started dating 6 months ago.\
  \ He's an okay guy but doesn't really have his shit together. I honestly haven't\
  \ gotten to know him too well. Well, my sister and him decided to get engaged a\
  \ week ago. After only 6 months together. My family and I are kind of taken aback\
  \ honestly but it's her life. My dad's 60th birthday was this past weekend and surprise\
  \ they wanted a photo. I was making space for my gf when my aunt said \"(my gf)\
  \ would you mind taking the photo?\" I was kind of surprised and my gf was a little\
  \ stunned. But she still was like \"sure! sounds good\" I said \"Um why isn't (my\
  \ gf) in the photo?\" She said \"Well, Bob is engaged to Kelly so he should be in\
  \ the photo\" I was like \" (my gf) has been here longer, she shouldn't be excluded.\"\
  \ My gf chimed in \"It's okay I don't mind\" but I continued \"it doesn't seem fair\
  \ to exclude her\" My mom said \"Fiance's get included\" \"I don't care if they're\
  \ engaged. (my gf) wasn't included for years. Why is he more important?\" Bob said\
  \ \"dude it's not important. It's a photo and yeah I am engaged to Kelly. I should\
  \ be in it\" My sister chimed in \"he's my fiance whether you like it or not. Let's\
  \ just take the photo\" my gf, obviously uncomfortable, said \"it's okay. It's just\
  \ a photo. I don't mind\" we took the photo but I wasn't happy about it. Bob gave\
  \ my dirty looks the rest of the night and my sister outright ignored me. On the\
  \ ride home my gf said she didn't think it was necessarily wrong but it did make\
  \ her feel pretty uncomfortable and I needed to be nice to Bob. My mom said that\
  \ I shouldn't have made a scene. But I feel like she should've been included. AITA?"
