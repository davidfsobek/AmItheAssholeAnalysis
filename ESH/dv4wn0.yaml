selftext: "I(17) have always wanted a cat, but neither of my parents would ever let\
  \ me have one. Recently though, I volunteered at the shelter with my mom, and we\
  \ fell in love with one of them. So, she she told me I could adopt it if I got my\
  \ room cleaned (I knew where things were, I just had too much for a small room so\
  \ it was cluttered) and paid/cared for it 100% myself (I have a good job and am\
  \ home all the time so). \n\nSo I worked my ass off cleaning my room and a decent\
  \ bit of the house.. and surprise surprise, things changed. They aren't letting\
  \ me get the cat anymore. I'm devastated, and I just decided \"fuck it, I'm being\
  \ petty\" and just made my room a mess again. My parents are obviously pissed at\
  \ me for doing that, and I'll admit I am being petty, but if they can't keep their\
  \ word why should I keep mine?"
