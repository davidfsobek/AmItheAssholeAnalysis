selftext: "Here me out! \n\nMy friend asked me for a loan of about 100$ to get this\
  \ new Xbox game he wanted. Since I work a pretty good job and make decent money,\
  \ I said sure but he would have to pay me back when he can. \n\nHe bought the deluxe\
  \ version of the game and plays it a lot. I tried to ask my money for 4 months now.\
  \ I even  offered him to allow to pay in increments if he needed to. He always says\
  \ that he doesn\u2019t have the money right now or that he will get it to me soon.\n\
  \nWhat drove me to the edge is when I saw on instagram that he posted a picture\
  \ of him out with friends buying the new oculus quest headset. \n\nI went to him\
  \ dorm, which is a floor below me and I stole his game since I have a spare key.\
  \ He is really mad that he \u201Cmisplaced it\u201D and has the audacity to ask\
  \ me for another loan. If he pays me back, I will give it back. So reddit, AITA?"
