selftext: "Hey, I\u2019m sharing a 2 bedroom apartment with 3 other girls. My roommate\
  \ and I both eat kimchi, while my 2 housemates don\u2019t. \nI have heard one of\
  \ them complain to her roommate a few times but never to me. It\u2019s been 2 months\
  \ living with her with no direct food complaints until today. I was eating lunch\
  \ with a side of kimchi and she said she can\u2019t put up with the stench of it\
  \ anymore. She told me about her headaches she gets from smelling it every time.\
  \ I told her I realize most people are put off by its smell, but I\u2019m really\
  \ disgusted by the smell of cheese too, which she makes a lot food with. She makes\
  \ pizza and cheesy pasta all the time and I can\u2019t stand them too but I put\
  \ up with them because we\u2019re housemates who need to compromise. I said if my\
  \ roommate and I can\u2019t have kimchi here, then she and her roommate can\u2019\
  t have cheese here. She told me it\u2019s way different and kimchi is way more smelly,\
  \ to which I respond that I see it the opposite way. She stormed off to her room."
