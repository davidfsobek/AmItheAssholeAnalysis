selftext: 'One of my cashiers is having a really bad time in her personal life but
  has been coming to work and doing her best. Last week she got really bad news but
  asked to stay at work, to distract herself. I said yes (which was my mistake. I
  should have had her go home and take some time.) She had a customer who was a real
  jerk to her. She was visibly upset and he was having a bad day and he took advantage
  of the situation and it culminated with me stepping in and the customer telling
  me to fire my cashier "because she''s an idiot and doesnt deserve her job if she
  cant do something as simple as her fucking job".


  He came in today and asked if remembered him. I said yes. He asked if my cashier
  was still there and I lied and told him "I''m sorry but after the events of last
  week I fired her. You were right, she didnt deserve her j9b". The gentleman got
  very upset and said he didnt mean it, he was just having a bad day, how could I
  do something like that, he had been hoping to apologize.


  Anyway, I let him stew for a second before telling him the truth, the cashier was
  still employed, everything was fine he was pissed off and told me that it was a
  dick move doing him like that. Was I an asshole for doing this?'
