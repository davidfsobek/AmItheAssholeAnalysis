selftext: "Firstly, I know it sounds petty but my parents are master manipulators\
  \ when it comes to making me feel bad and guilty over trivial things. Overreacting\
  \ seems to be their bread and butter at the moment and maybe they are right, but\
  \ just hear me out. Secondly, I\u2019m not looking for validation, I sincerely want\
  \ to know if I messed up and should change my behaviour around this. \n\nSo, a few\
  \ nights ago after a shitty day at work being called a blood sucking parasite, (I\
  \ shoot photos for families at kids schools and mums get upset with my companies\
  \ prices) I come home and decide to play some competitive Overwatch with my girlfriend.\
  \ We\u2019re close to finishing up the match when I hear a knock on my door followed\
  \ by it immediately being opened (which completely defeats the purpose of knocking\
  \ but it\u2019s at least something so I\u2019m grateful my parents do it). \n\n\u201C\
  Dinner time, come out and eat\u201D\n\n\u201CI\u2019ll be right there, just finishing\
  \ something off\u201D\n\nThis then sparks an entire 2 hour shouting match with my\
  \ dad yelling at me about how disrespectful (his insult of choice), rude and ungrateful\
  \ I am for not immediately dropping whatever I was doing to come and eat food. The\
  \ rationale seems to be that because he is \u201Cthe parent, I get to decide what\
  \ you do in my house and at what time it happens\u201D (Even writing that feels\
  \ irrational). I managed to calm him down only by stating that us yelling at each\
  \ other solves nothing and that we should come back in an hour or so when we can\
  \ talk rationally to each other. It seemed to silence him at the very least. \n\n\
  The only reason I\u2019m asking about this is because my sister just got yelled\
  \ at by my mum and she has been crying constantly for something even more trivial.\
  \ \n\nAll of that being said, I\u2019m 20, my brain hasn\u2019t fully developed\
  \ yet, maybe I am being disrespectful? Should I apologise?\n\nPlease let me know,\
  \ AITA?\n\nEdit: Hey everyone :D\n\nFinally just read through everything and wanted\
  \ to answer a few questions and final thoughts. \n\nUsually dinner is sometime between\
  \ 6-8pm and is rarely consistent. It\u2019s constantly changing due to my dad or\
  \ his partner getting home late from work and I\u2019ll usually also get a 10 minute\
  \ warning which I didn\u2019t that night.\n\nWeirdly for the first time ever, he\
  \ came into my room and apologised for having a shitty day and taking it out on\
  \ me and I apologised too for not asking for notice. \n\nThanks everyone."
