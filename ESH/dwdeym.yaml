selftext: "I hate sharing my food. If I buy or make a meal, I want to eat every last\
  \ bite myself. Otherwise the portions are all thrown off and it bugs me mentally.\
  \ \n\nMy fianc\xE9 and I have started living together and we generally don\u2019\
  t have many issues. Whenever I buy or make a meal, my fianc\xE9 will \u201Cwant\
  \ a bite\u201D. His bites are usually huge and way bigger than mine would be and\
  \ it just pisses me off. \n\nI always ask him if he\u2019d like some before I make\
  \ or order my food and the answer is usually \u201Cno\u201D or \u201CI\u2019ll just\
  \ have some of yours\u201D. This is obviously not okay with me. \n\nI\u2019ve made\
  \ this clear to him, but I\u2019m beginning to think that he thinks I\u2019m not\
  \ being serious and am only mildly upset. To combat this problem, every time I make\
  \ or order a meal now, I purposely add an ingredient or topping he hates. \n\nHe\
  \ has picked up on this and thinks it\u2019s an asshole thing to do. \n\n**EDIT:**\
  \ Wow, I was not expecting this many responses to a seemingly silly issue. I must\
  \ say, I\u2019m very surprised to see a bunch of people attempting to diagnose me\
  \ or make this issue a lot bigger than it is. I believe that is partly due to some\
  \ of the wording I used in this post\u2014particularly, \u201CI want to eat every\
  \ last bite myself. Otherwise the portions are all thrown off and it bugs me mentally\u201D\
  .  Not sure why I added the \u2018mentally\u2019, but I wouldn\u2019t have expected\
  \ so many people to latch on to the first few sentences and then go on to ignore\
  \ a lot of the major points in my post. \n\nMy fianc\xE9 and I have an amazing relationship\
  \ and to those offering advice related to breaking up or calling off our wedding\u2014\
  are you serious? We have an issue on our hands for sure, but the fact that some\
  \ of you are so quick to judge a relationship and make such rash decisions about\
  \ it is really weird. The entire point of my post was to ask if I was TA\u2014I\
  \ wasn\u2019t asking for my relationship to be analyzed with the few meagre details\
  \ this post provided. \n\nLastly, I want to address the fact that I absolutely do\
  \ not have an ED, nor do I have weird psychological  issues surrounding food and\
  \ sharing. I simply want to eat MY plate of food BY MYSELF. That\u2019s all there\
  \ is to it, really. I\u2019m in no way *outraged* or acting like a rabid animal\
  \ as some of you have pictured for some reason. I\u2019m simply annoyed and was\
  \ looking for an innocent way to get my annoyance across\u2014by adding ingredients\
  \ or toppings that my fianc\xE9 hates, but I happen to enjoy. \n\nLike I mentioned\
  \ in my original post, I\u2019m absolutely fine ordering him a meal or even preparing\
  \ an extra portion for him IF HE WANTS, but when he says no, I feel I am under no\
  \ obligation to STILL order or make extra food after he says no. He\u2019s a grown\
  \ up, he can fix something for himself if he happens to change his mind later. \n\
  \nThanks for all your posts, nonetheless!\n\n**EDIT 2:** Some of you are really\
  \ intent on diagnosing me with a problem I do not have. Giving me advice to see\
  \ a therapist or psychiatrist. Some of you have gone so far as to message me and\
  \ INSIST that I have a problem even though I\u2019ve repeatedly said I do not. I\u2019\
  m mainly making this edit to say that none of you have any right to diagnose ANYONE\
  \ on ANY post. You think just because you read a couple paragraphs about an issue\
  \ you have full reign to insist and harass someone to go see a therapist???? That\u2019\
  s insane. Some of you need help, not the poor people who come on here simply wanting\
  \ to know if they\u2019re an asshole.\n\nJust because someone wants to eat their\
  \ own plate of food doesn\u2019t mean they have mental issues. If someone repeatedly\
  \ steals off your plate even though you\u2019ve repeatedly told them no + offered\
  \ to make them their own portion and they\u2019ve still said no, then it\u2019s\
  \ obviously going to get annoying. I\u2019m not just making myself food and making\
  \ my fianc\xE9 go hungry. He\u2019s fully capable of making or ordering his own\
  \ food. Just because I\u2019m annoyed by his constant need to steal my food, does\
  \ not mean I have mental issues surrounding food. \n\nAm I TA? Sure, maybe to some\
  \ people. Do I have mental issues and need to get professional help? Absolutely\
  \ not. If you\u2019re someone who doesn\u2019t like to share their food, don\u2019\
  t let weird people on reddit make you feel as though there\u2019s something wrong\
  \ with you. I\u2019m willing to bet 100% of the people who voted YTA or ESH are\
  \ moochers and steal off other people\u2019s plates instead of getting their own\
  \ damn food."
