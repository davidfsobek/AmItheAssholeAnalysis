selftext: "UPDATED!\nMy wife (F28) came home late last night saying she got held up\
  \ at work. \n\nI (M27) was warming up the food and setting out the dishes as she\
  \ went to shower and get changed. She left her phone on the table and I see a message\
  \ pop up saying 'tonight was amazing, xxx', curious to what was going on I checked\
  \ her phone, this message was from one of her female co-workers (good friend of\
  \ hers) and it turns out they had a girls night in after work. \n\nWhen she came\
  \ down I told her about the message and she went ballistic on me for snooping through\
  \ her phone, I tried to tell her to look at it from my perspective and how it looked\
  \ to me. She carried on with the dialogue of how I should trust her etc. (Which\
  \ I do, but when a message like that appears on your SOs phone, thoughts come to\
  \ mind). \n\nI replied saying how I don't think what I did was wrong and that she\
  \ didn't have to lie about being held up at work when it was clear from the messages\
  \ that she had spent time after work at her friends house. \n\nThis got her even\
  \ more annoyed for some reason and she ended up just ignoring me for the rest of\
  \ the night. I'm thinking she must have had a rough day\n\nUpdate:\n\nWe've talked\
  \ things out after a nights sleep and she's understanding of how it must've seemed\
  \ from my perspective. We both apologized for the way we acted. It's just that she\
  \ really did have a tough day at work and then an even harder job of cheering up\
  \ her friend after. \n\nIt turns out her friend was fired and has been pretty down\
  \ recently, so my wife was just trying to lift her spirits. \n\nShe was pretty tired\
  \ yesterday and didn't want to go through the full story so she thought it best\
  \ to just brush it under 'held up at work'. Which I understand, I've done it a few\
  \ times myself but we do tell each other later on, which is why I wasn't concerned\
  \ about her being at her friends when she said she was at work. \n\nAlso for those\
  \ concerned as to whether this friend is really a female, or if my wife is cheating\
  \ on me with her, the answers no. I know her aswell as her husband and definitely\
  \ no cheating going on which is why I wasn't concerned as soon as I found out who\
  \ the text was from. \n\nTo those thinking if I'm controlling that's why she didn't\
  \ tell me the truth, again, no, I don't control her and if she does go out after\
  \ work she normally tells me and I'm fine with that. Like I mentioned above, this\
  \ time, she just wasn't in the mood for telling me what went on (as we normally\
  \ gossip after she's hung out with her friends) \n\nI'm leaving the post up but\
  \ won't be coming back to it. Personally I think ES in this situation."
