selftext: "Basically the title.\n\n\nMy boyfriend likes to cook. And one of those\
  \ meals we have on occasion is steak.\n\n\nI like my steak well done where he likes\
  \ his more rare. I have asked him, time and time again, to make sure my steak doesn\u2019\
  t have a lot of pink. Nevertheless, I continue to receive bright pink steaks. Now\
  \ this would be fine if he forgot once, but apparently it\u2019s not a matter of\
  \ forgetting. He thinks that steak that\u2019s cooked well done doesn\u2019t have\
  \ the same flavor as one that\u2019s raw. Sure, that\u2019s probably true, but I\
  \ like my steak well done and that\u2019s why he\u2019s refusing to cook it like\
  \ that.\n\nSo what inspired this post was, as you can guess, a pink steak. Today\
  \ was the day I found out why he wouldn\u2019t cook it well done for me. And now\
  \ he\u2019s saying that he will refuse to buy me the same price steak as he\u2019\
  ll buy himself. He wants to buy a 20.00 steak for himself and a 10.00 one for me\
  \ because apparently there\u2019s no point to cooking an expensive steak well done.\n\
  \nHe thinks that cause we don\u2019t buy steak often it means that he\u2019s NTA,\
  \ meanwhile I disagree.\n\n\nEdit: He has given me food poisoning from it before.\n\
  \nFinal edit:\nWe\u2019re both laughing at the replies here - some of you guys go\
  \ crazy over your steaks! \n\nJust to clarify a couple things - I like medium rare\
  \ steaks and well done, I just have some stomach issues (IBS) that is really hit\
  \ or miss when it comes to food. Hence why I \u201Cprefer\u201D them as cooked as\
  \ possible.\n\nAnyway, thanks for the input! He\u2019s going to keep the quality\
  \ of meat the same for me after this, even if I do get a couple of \u201Cyou\u2019\
  re eating leather\u201D jokes from him from now on. (Thanks for that haha)"
title: AITA for wanting my steak well done and wanting the same quality steak as my
