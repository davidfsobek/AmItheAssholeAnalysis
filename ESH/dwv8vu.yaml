selftext: "I'm a 23 (m) she is 21 (f) and we've been together for a little over 3\
  \ years now. Yesterday I texted her to put the clothes in the dryer when she came\
  \ home from work. She said she would and even said she did. Today I look and the\
  \ clothes are still in the washer. I asked why she never did and she says \"you\
  \ only told me to fold clothes\". I send her a screenshot of the message and I said\
  \ with it \"I'd rather you say you forgot then lie\" because I'm always about honesty\
  \ and I wont get mad if you forget its just clothes.\n\nThis isnt the first time\
  \ shes given me these little lies. She then replies with \"Can you not talk to me??\
  \ I didn't lie I thought you said take the clothes out of the dryer. I don't appreciate\
  \ you talking to me like that. I brought them out and folded them and it's like\
  \ you don't appreciate that.\" I asked her 3 times if she put the clothes in the\
  \ dryer throughout a 4 hour span and she even told me in text she put it in the\
  \ dryer. She replies \"I literally thought you meant take the clothes out of the\
  \ DRYER I'm sorry I got confused you don't have to talk down to me.\" I reply with\
  \ \"Okay can you please ask next time to make sure because I had to do the load\
  \ again because it smells.\" She responds with \"Sorry about everything sorry I\
  \ got confused. I'll talk to you later because I'm having a panic attack and can't\
  \ stop crying. Sorry I \ngot confused and fucked up.\" \n\n\nI feel like an asshole\
  \ for ever bringing this up now and I constantly feel like I should never mention\
  \ anything to her and just fix it myself. I have no one else to talk to about this...\n\
  \n\nEDIT : I feel like I'm going to spend hours trying to explain every little detail\
  \ about this situation but I think I found my baseline and I appreciate everyone's\
  \ responses truly. I've come to the conclusion that ESH. I know what I said isnt\
  \ perfect and I continue to work on myself everyday. I do love this girl very much\
  \ and in 3 years, we haven't gone to bed upset. We've already talked and apologized\
  \ and things are good again. It streamlines to bad communication and we both need\
  \ to work on it."
