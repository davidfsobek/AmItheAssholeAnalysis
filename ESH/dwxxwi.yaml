selftext: "Context, as a teenager I was very stupid. And had really low self esteem.\
  \ Surprise surprise, I blindly follow the first guy to ever show me any attention.\
  \ I get pregnant with his kid and he leaves. So, I\u2019m a 19 year old with a baby\
  \ I wasn\u2019t ready for. Life was hard. I had to drop out of school, struggled\
  \ with a lot, but I\u2019m made it through.\n\nI\u2019m now 39 years old, married\
  \ with a great guy, and at the best point in my life. I also went back to school,\
  \ got my bachelors in computer science and now have a great job. On top of that,\
  \ about 5 years ago, I was able to buy my first house with my husband. \n\nMy son\
  \ moved out of the house to go to college last year, which meant that there was\
  \ an empty room.\n\nNow, I LOVE crafts. I love crocheting, knitting, embroidery,\
  \ cross stitching, sewing, the like. I first learned to sew out of necessity because\
  \ I couldn\u2019t afford to buy much clothes and had to make due with what I had.\
  \ I then learned to embroider and cross stitch from a friend of mine. It then became\
  \ a stress reliever for me, a way to vent my frustration in a way. On top of that,\
  \ I could make little toys and bags for my son.\n\nAfter discussing it with my son\
  \ and husband, I decided to turn his room into my crafts room, a place I go to unwind\
  \ and relax. I\u2019ve slowly been putting away money and getting the room ready.\
  \ I\u2019ve already bought the shelves and wall racks for my yarn and floss, as\
  \ well as a sewing table.\n\nRecently, however, my SIL lost her job and had nowhere\
  \ to go with her 4 year old. My husband suggests they stay with us.\n\nPersonally,\
  \ I don\u2019t mind, I emphasize with her. I know what it\u2019s like to be a single\
  \ mom and to have nowhere to go. So, of course I would welcome them, but my house\
  \ only has two rooms, the master and my craft room.\n\nWhile discussing the living\
  \ arrangements with SIL, I mention that we don\u2019t have an extra room for them,\
  \ that they would have to stay in the living room. She agrees to it, saying that\
  \ it was only temporary, so it\u2019s fine.\n\nWe then show SIL around the house.\
  \ When we go up stairs, she asks about the empty room and why she couldn\u2019t\
  \ stay in there. I explain what I plan to do with the room, and I don\u2019t know\
  \ if this flipped some switch, but she gets really mad at me.\n\nShe starts yelling,\
  \ saying it\u2019s really vain and selfish of me to want a whole room just to knit.\
  \ That it\u2019s rude of me to put them in the living room when there\u2019s a room\
  \ available for them. That it\u2019s sneaky of me to not mention that we had an\
  \ extra room. \n\nI\u2019m taken aback and explain that I already have the table\
  \ and some supplies in there, that I\u2019d rather not have them be moved. That\
  \ if it\u2019s only temporary, there shouldn\u2019t be any problem with them staying\
  \ in my living room.\n\nShe storms out, saying she doesn\u2019t want to stay if\
  \ it means I would be looking down on them. My husband kinda gives me a weird look\
  \ and runs after her. He texted me about an hour ago saying they\u2019re at their\
  \ folks place figuring stuff out.\n\nI\u2019m feeling really guilty now. AITA?\n\
  \nEdit: Thank you everyone that responded. After some time thinking about it and\
  \ reading through the comments, I realized I was a huge jerk. I see my younger self\
  \ in my SIL and I understand why she stormed off like that. I guess I was just frustrated\
  \ in the moment. I gave my husband a call and asked them both to come over. SIL\
  \ apologized for storming off and I apologized for being selfish. After some crying\
  \ and hugging, we decided that they would be sleeping in the living room until we\
  \ could get most of my supplies out of the room, which can probably be done over\
  \ the weekend\n\nEdit: Also, because others have said I should add this, the living\
  \ room couch is one of those that fold out into a bed, so it\u2019s not like they\u2019\
  ll be sleeping on a couch together"
