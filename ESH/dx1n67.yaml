selftext: "He wanted the money for frivolous reasons- it wasn\u2019t like he needed\
  \ it for food or bills. I was ok with it because he said he would pay me back when\
  \ he got his next paycheck, which would be like 3 days later. Not trying to humblebrag\
  \ here, but I\u2019m fairly well-off and he isn\u2019t, so I didn\u2019t think it\
  \ was a big deal- I could spare the money and I trusted him to pay me back. I\u2019\
  ve since realized how stupid that was, so y\u2019all don\u2019t need to point it\
  \ out. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t worry about being the asshole, here... but he lost his\
  \ job a few months later, and (according to him) his income was inconsistent for\
  \ a while. We don\u2019t really talk anymore, but according to Facebook he has another\
  \ job, though I can\u2019t tell kind of job it is and I obviously don\u2019t know\
  \ how well it pays. I felt awkward about the situation for a while, so I didn\u2019\
  t actually ask him to pay me back until a month or two after he lost his job. Almost\
  \ every time, he\u2019s had some excuse for why he couldn\u2019t do so- he had unexpected\
  \ expenses, he was barely making enough to cover bills... He did always say he\u2019\
  d pay me back eventually. \n\nThe other thing is that I don\u2019t really NEED the\
  \ money. I don\u2019t consider $120 a small amount, but it\u2019s not enough to\
  \ make a difference in my life. On the other hand it is my money and he did promise\
  \ to pay me back within a week. If I send the text he\u2019ll probably just give\
  \ me some excuse and promise to pay me back at some unspecified point in the future-\
  \ I\u2019m not expecting to see the money again and texting him probably won\u2019\
  t change that. So idk.\n\nEDIT: some people seem to think I was bragging about having\
  \ money- that wasn\u2019t my intention but I see how it could come off that way.\
  \ I included that information to add context- we\u2019re on different levels financially,\
  \ and $120 isn\u2019t a huge hit for me to take. I\u2019m aware that this makes\
  \ me privileged. \n\nI won\u2019t be texting him, and I\u2019ll consider this a\
  \ $120 lesson."
