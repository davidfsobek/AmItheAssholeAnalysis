selftext: So my best friend of a year and a half has turne out to be a lying p.o.s.
  and thief . this guy stole my phone ,4 calculators, a pair of glasses and ear buds
  from me. Recently he blamed me for the theft of a mutual friends phone in school.Problem
  is the guy who's phone was stolen was using it all day at school and I sat on the
  opposite side of the classroom.My "friend" had "evidence" that I stole it . It was
  one of those your phone is here pictures.problem with the supposed evidence is we
  finished school at 1 in the afternoon but the time stamp was 12:44 pm.and the picture
  was had said the phone was already at my house. He is quite well off has a house,a
  Subaru xv 2015 model,a Peugeot 3008 and an Isuzu pickup truck.Needless to say he
  is middle-class but the catch is because his parents are farmers they cheat the
  government whilst doing their taxes.He accepts welfare from the government and keeps
  most of their cash at home. WIBTA for reporting their tax fraud ?
