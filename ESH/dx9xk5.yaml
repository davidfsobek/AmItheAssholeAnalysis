selftext: 'I''m borrowing my brother''s account for this, as I don''t usually use
  Reddit, but he said I should ask for you guys'' opinion on this:


  My husband(38M) doesn''t think he''s an asshole against waiters, but he thinks I(37F)
  am. I''m 99% sure he is, but I don''t think I am. Maybe we''re both assholes? I
  don''t like small talk and always try to avoid it. He loves small talk, but has
  an annoying tendency to be passive-aggressive. We went out for dinner yesterday,
  and by describing that I can simultaneously describe why I think he''s an asshole
  and why he thinks I''m an asshole.


  We got seated at our table.


  Waitress: So, weekend''s coming up. Do you have any exciting plans?


  Husband: We''re going to [art museum]. It''ll be raining all day anyway. We love
  art, especially blah blah blah...


  Waitress: Cool!


  The waitress looked at me.


  Waitress: Are you also looking forward to a fun day at the museum?


  Me: ...


  Waitress: ...


  Me: ...


  Waitress: Um... okay. Do you want something to drink?


  We ordered food and drinks and started waiting.


  My husband waved down the waitress.


  My husband: "Hi! So, I''m pretty sure we got here before those guys...


  He pointed at the party at another table.


  My husband: ...But they''ve already gotten their food while we''re still waiting
  for our food. Ha ha ha


  Waitress: Oh, I see. I''ll ask if you can have your food soon.


  My husband: Ha ha, okay. I just thought it was kinda funny. I thought we were supposed
  to get the food before them because we ordered before them. Ha ha. But I was probably
  wrong.


  Waitress: I''m sorry about that. I''ll ask the chef. I''m sure you can have your
  food very soon.


  My mand: Ha ha, okay. It''s just a bit weird that we had to wait longer.


  The waitress left.


  My husband looked at me.


  My husband: I can''t believe it! Why in the world did they get their food before
  us?


  Me: I don''t know. And I don''t care.


  My husband: How can you not care? It''s just so unfair!


  Me: Our food will probably still be good even if it''s a bit late. That''s why I
  don''t care.


  My husband: But it''s not acceptable!


  The food arrived. There was a little mix-up in the food my husband ordered.


  My husband: Uh, hm... maybe my order was too difficult.


  Waitress: Excuse me?


  My husband: Well, I didn''t think my order would be difficult. I just ordered blah
  blah blah, and now I''ve been served blah blah bleh. Ha ha. No offense. I''m sorry
  if my order was difficult. I just tried picking something on the menu. Ha ha ha.


  Waitress: I''m very sorry about the mistake.


  My husband: Don''t worry, things like that happen. Ha ha ha


  The waiter looked at me.


  Waitress: Is everything okay with your meal?


  I didn''t want to small talk, so I just nodded.


  My husband: [My name], she asked you a question.


  Me: And I replied.


  Well, yeah, that was what happened. When we got home, a fight started. He thinks
  I was an asshole for not wanting to small talk, and I think he was the asshole for
  being passive-aggressive. AITA for not wanting to small talk? Is he the asshole?
  Or are we both?'
title: AITA for the way I interacted with a waitress?
