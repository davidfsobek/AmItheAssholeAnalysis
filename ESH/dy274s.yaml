  \ don\u2019t have to tell me that, today we had a project at school and she kind\
  \ of messed it up and when she did that, she thought it would be funny if she said\
  \ \u201Coh my luck is as bad as your looks\u201D which kind of hurts and I had enough\
  \ of her making fun of me so I told her that my luck isn\u2019t as fat as her either,\
  \ and she was MAD apparently calling her fat is really offensive.\nSo AITA?"
