selftext: "I turn 30 next month. My birthday is on the holiday so I have a bit of\
  \ a sore spot about never getting a real celebration (I know, I know I'm an adult\
  \ and it doesn't matter anymore but a childhood of overlooked birthdays sticks with\
  \ you!)\n\nMy boyfriend decided to plan a surprise birthday trip for me over the\
  \ holidays - we're both separately well-traveled but have never been out of the\
  \ country together. He chose somewhere tropical to escape New England winter and\
  \ said he hoped it was a country I've never been before. I told him he could cross-check\
  \ with my \"Countries I've been to\" list or just run it by my parents. He didnt,\
  \ just booked the flights ($1200).\n\nWe went to a cafe yesterday with a bunch of\
  \ travel books and I picked up the Turks and Caicos book and mentioned a trip I\
  \ took there. He got a look on his face and I immediately knew that's where he booked\
  \ the trip. \n\nI know it's spoiled to complain about a vacation BUT:\n\n\\-We're\
  \ going to share the costs of this trip and we don't have a lot of money. $1200\
  \ just for flights, before lodging, is a lot to go somewhere I don't have the desire\
  \ to return to.\n\n\\-I plan \\*everything\\* in our day-to-day life. I found the\
  \ apartment we rent, I plan dinners for the week, I make all of our date night reservations\
  \ and ticket purchases, I've planned every other vacation. I was really looking\
  \ forward to having him take the lead on one thing.\n\n\\-I wouldn't complain about\
  \ going back to Paris or something, where there's plenty to see and do, but I don't\
  \ want to sit on a beach for a week in a beach town I've already been to. It's not\
  \ my kind of vacation in the first place.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAm I a spoiled brat or\
  \ is he a lazy dude who didn't do any homework before throwing down a bunch of our\
  \ money? Lay it on me!"

  already been?
