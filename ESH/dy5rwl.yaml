selftext: "So me and my girlfriend have been dating for over a year. It's a serious\
  \ relationship and I love this girl. But recently a fight broke out and I told her\
  \ she cries over everything. \n\n\nA bit of background.. she is a sensitive person.\
  \ And that's just her personality, which I understand. I'm completely different.\
  \ I'm the opposite of sensitive and I usually don't get offended or hurt at all.\
  \ Infact I kinda joke about everything, even the problems that I have in my life.\
  \ So when the relationship started, I was very empathetic. Whenever she cried over\
  \ something I used to be there for her 100% and try to calm things down or make\
  \ her feel better. Even if we were fighting and she was wrong, if she started crying\
  \ I would stop, apologize, and cheer her up (or atleast try my best). This went\
  \ on for quite a long time. \n\nBut then things changed a few months back. I started\
  \ noticing just how often she cries. And, I'll be honest.. it doesn't affect me\
  \ as much as it used to anymore. It's just that I got used to it. I know it's probably\
  \ sounds heartless, but that's how it is rn. Because she cries so many times, I\
  \ just don't feel that same sense of empathy that I used to. \n\nAnd the fact that\
  \ she uses that as leverage doesn't help. From what I can tell, her crying is genuine.\
  \ She not faking it. BUT I've started feeling like she's manipulating me with her\
  \ tears. If she starts crying and I don't apologise or pamper her feelings, she\
  \ gets upset that I don't even care about her crying. And then she gets even more\
  \ angry that I care so less about her. This had often put me in weird situations\
  \ where I'm in the middle of something important or something urgent and she starts\
  \ crying over something really small (sometimes not even related to the relationship)\
  \ and if I don't acknowledge her feelings or be there for her, she tells me I'm\
  \ a horrible boyfriend for not even caring about her tears. \n\nFast forward to\
  \ present. We had a fight over something which I'll not go in the details of. This\
  \ time I was pissed at her too. Like I said I don't usually get upset but this was\
  \ pretty upsetting for me. I was trying to make her understand my point of view\
  \ and she started crying. However I just felt like  she was manipulating me into\
  \ giving up. So I didn't stop. I was still angry at her and I ignored her crying.\
  \ This really upset her and she started crying even harder about how I take her\
  \ for granted and that even when she's crying I act completely cold and how I don't\
  \ love her the same way anymore. So I got annoyed and said \"you just cry over everything.\
  \ I can't be there for you all the Time\". \n\nThis visibly hurt her a lot and after\
  \ a lot of \"I hate you\" and \"you are a horrible person\" she hung up the call.\
  \ Now I feel kinda guilty. It's true that I don't treat her crying the same way\
  \ I used to. But I also feel like she's using  that as leverage and that it's unreasonable\
  \ for me to always pamper her when she cries over small things. \nAITA?"
