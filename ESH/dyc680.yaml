selftext: 'My wife and I are recently married, and she is a Catholic. She has been
  pregnant for 7 months, and the conversation never came up. Yesterday, she told me
  that she has been talking with her parents, and she wants our daughter to grow up
  Catholic. I told her that she should decide for herself when she matures, because
  I grew up very Christian and when I was 19 I decided to become athiest. She said
  that she won''t let her daughter grow up athiest, and we kept arguing. I''m starting
  to doubt if I made the right choice, AITA?

  Edit: the reason we never had this conversation is because she never acted relegious
  the whole time we were together, and she never went to Church. Her parents are religious
  though, and I think they convinced her to make this choice.'
