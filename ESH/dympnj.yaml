selftext: "I (21F) have a college friend (23M) we\u2019ll call Zander who recently\
  \ moved in with his online girlfriend, (25F) Bree. (Who he\u2019s only known for\
  \ like a couple months and Zander is paying for the entire rent because she doesn\u2019\
  t work) \n\nIm not the biggest fan of Bree for a few reasons including the ones\
  \ above. She constantly talks about sex with Zander and how \u201Cbig\u201D he is,\
  \ which is just really cringe. She constantly gate keeps everything. She never participates\
  \ in the conversation just interrupts with antidotes about herself and how progressive/brave/pretty\
  \ she is. She also constantly makes herself the authority on everything when she\
  \ really just read something about it on twitter. She is essentially someone who\
  \ has spent their whole life online and now thinks they are gods gift to earth while\
  \ having no experience or talking to anyone with a different viewpoint than her\
  \ own. And the thing that really bothers me, because it\u2019s completely hypocritical\
  \ to her social justice-y image, is that she constantly makes fun of my boyfriend\u2019\
  s (21M) appearance to his face.\n\nMy boyfriend is a slender nerdy-type guy. He\
  \ is really sweet, funny and quiet when you first meet him. He is not one for confrontation\
  \ but I know the things she says to him bother him. She makes comments on his facial\
  \ hair, his size, and how quiet he is. He has been going to the gym recently and\
  \ trying to bulk up a bit. I know he is insecure about being slender and comments\
  \ like \u201Cwow I had no Idea you have ever been to a gym\u201D are hurtful to\
  \ his self esteem. I know she makes fun of him because everyone loves him and kinda\
  \ just puts up with her. I also know she targets him precisely because he wont say\
  \ anything, she does not do it to me or someone else in the group because we will\
  \ shut her down.\n\nNow here\u2019s the problem, all hang outs happen at her and\
  \ Zander\u2019s house. They have it to themselves and I appreciate them opening\
  \ their home up to us. However if she makes another comment about my boyfriends\
  \ appearance I don\u2019t think I can sit by even if it is her home.  I want to\
  \ call her out for spouting all this stuff about how the world is so cruel when\
  \ she\u2019s being straight up really mean to someone who has only showed her kindness.\
  \ I have said nothing so far because I don\u2019t want to fight my boyfriends battles\
  \ for him but its getting beyond that and more just calling someone out for being\
  \ a bad person. Would I be TA for calling her out?\n\nTl;dr my friends girlfriend\
  \ is being mean to my boyfriend WIBTA for calling her out even in her own house?"
