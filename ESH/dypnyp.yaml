selftext: "I [F29] am a bridesmaid in my friend\u2019s [F30] wedding. We\u2019ve been\
  \ friends since high school.\n\nI spent the day at her place, helping her with put\
  \ together wedding favors along with some other friends. She and her friend went\
  \ out shopping, while the rest of us continued to work. While they were gone, one\
  \ of the BMs was texting the BM group about the day of requests. BM asked if we\
  \ were comfortable wearing fake lashes. I said no, because I have a lot of eye problems\
  \ and I\u2019m hesitant to introduce foreign substances near my eyes. Eyeliner doesn\u2019\
  t bother me, but mascara can sometimes be irritating so I only wear it for special\
  \ occasions.\n\nWhen the bride came back from shopping, she stormed in and immediately\
  \ said \u201CDo you even want to be a bridesmaid?\u201D I was shocked that she was\
  \ so angry. It\u2019s not like I just don\u2019t want to wear fake lashes because\
  \ I\u2019m picky. I was more concerned about irritating my already sensitive eyes.\
  \ In my shock, I replied no and reiterated my medical concerns.\n\nThen she went\
  \ on to yell at me for other (untrue) things in the past which she never mentioned\
  \ before (which is unlike her...she usually speaks her mind). She stopped yelling\
  \ and left the room. I immediately burst into tears and went home.\n\nLater in the\
  \ night, she texted me and asked if I was okay and she didn\u2019t care about the\
  \ fake lashes, but was shocked that I so easily said I didn\u2019t want to be a\
  \ bridesmaid.\n\nI sent her a long text the next day saying that I understood that\
  \ she was stressed, but explained how hurt I was by her words. I also brought up\
  \ the points she made about me while providing explanations to the ones that were\
  \ not true. She ignored all of my concerns and replied only with \u201Cso you don\u2019\
  t want to be a bridesmaid anymore?\u201D I responded that it would be inconsiderate\
  \ if I dropped out now, but if she wants me out, I understand.\n\nLater, I found\
  \ out that she texted my mom to tell her she\u2019ll no longer be using our house\
  \ for the rehearsal lunch since \u201Cwe\u2019re not on good terms\u201D\n\nIt\u2019\
  s been a day and she hasn\u2019t responded. I\u2019ve been so upset that I\u2019\
  ve been physically sick. I don\u2019t care about the fake lashes. I\u2019m upset\
  \ that she was so willing to drop me as a bridesmaid so easily and refused to listen\
  \ to my side. I\u2019m tired of waiting to see if she\u2019ll keep me as a BM. I\u2019\
  m tempted to just finalize the dropout and say I\u2019m not going to even come to\
  \ the wedding or help out at the venue (therefore killing the friendship which is\
  \ a first for me)\n\nTL,DR: My friend got upset that I didn\u2019t want to wear\
  \ fake lashes due to medical concerns, and asked if I still wanted to be a BM. I\
  \ was shocked at her hostile tone, so I reacted and said no. She began to yell at\
  \ me about other things she was upset about me (but never brought up before) and\
  \ didn\u2019t listen when I tried to reason with her. I\u2019m tempted to drop out\
  \ of the wedding completely due to stress and disappointment."
