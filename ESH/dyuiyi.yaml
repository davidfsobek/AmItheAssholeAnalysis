selftext: 'Little backstory,


  My father passed away, he was a talented musician (mainly in piano, but played a
  lot of other instruments too.


  For the past year I''ve been teaching myself on his antique Yamaha piano, it''s
  been helping me cope and keep my mind off things.


  I''ve been practising extremely hard, and I''m planning to try out for my churches
  praise team, because my father had always wanted me to do that, but I never gave
  it the time of day because I wanted to do other things.


  &#x200B;


  Anyways, I was playing one day and my younger brother barged into the basement and
  told me to "shut the fuck up". It was 5pm on a thursday and I didn''t see the reason
  why I couldn''t play. (I normally play during the day for like 3hrs so I don''t
  disturb people trying to sleep at night)


  I asked him why I couldn''t and he said because it sounded like horse shit. Not
  going to lie, that hurt me really badly inside, I''ve been practising so hard and
  what he said wasn''t untrue. We got in a huge fight and haven''t talked since.


  Every time I try to play, I hear him scream for me to shut up, or stomping his feet
  on the floor above until I get off.


  We haven''t talked for a couple of days, but he''s come down with a really bad cough
  . He is repeatedly coughing throughout the day, and it is annoying, but isn''t anything
  to get mad over. However, since then I''ve been telling him to shut up.


  Every time he coughs I tell him to shut up. He''s watching TV while coughing? I
  tell him to shut up. He''s in his room coughing? I tell him to shut up.


  He asked me why I''m being such an asshole, and I said "because it sounds like horseshit".


  Ever since then he hasn''t bothered me about playing the piano, and I don''t bother
  him about his cough.


  I feel like that takes care of that, but my mom says I should take it easier on
  him in light of what has happened this past year. Yes, I do feel bad for what he''s
  going through, but I''m going through it too. AITA?


  edit- for clarity, im 18, he''s 17'
