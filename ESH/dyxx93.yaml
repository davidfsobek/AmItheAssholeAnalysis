selftext: "I live with my parents and I suffer from pretty severe depression. I taught\
  \ myself how to cook and bake as a hobby to keep me busy and do something productive.\
  \ Anyway, this past year I started cooking dinner for my mom, dad, and myself every\
  \ night. And almost every night, my mom makes some sort of complaint about the food.\
  \ \n\nAnd it's not constructive criticism, she'll complain that I used red bell\
  \ peppers and I should've used green or yellow bell peppers. Or some random thing\
  \ that doesn't even affect the dish.\n\nTonight, I spent a long time making a curry\
  \ dish. We sit down to eat and she sees stems from the tomatoes I peeled and immediately\
  \ says \"Ugh you put tomatoes in this?\"\n\nI know she likes tomatoes and she just\
  \ found something to complain about. So I filled up my plate, and then dumped the\
  \ entire pan of curry into the sink. \n\nAITA for being petty and throwing away\
  \ the food?"
