selftext: "I am maid of honor for my best friend Becca and the wedding is in a few\
  \ days. Coincidentally, my boyfriend Tom proposed to me a few days ago. I asked\
  \ Becca if she'd like to be my maid of honour, and she refused on a ''matter of\
  \ principle''. \n\nBecca is a lovely person, but she has extremely traditional views.\
  \ Her fiance is a lovely man, but is 10 years older than her (her and I are both\
  \ 30), very handsome, and probably earns about 5x as much as she does. Becca is\
  \ very much a ''date up not down'' sort of woman. I have no problem with this at\
  \ all. Tom, meanwhile, is 6 years younger than me. Gorgeous and makes a decent income,\
  \ but I still out earn him considerably. \n\nEver since Tom and I have been dating,\
  \ Becca has constantly (and LOUDLY) voiced her disapproval. To her an older woman\
  \ and a younger man is ''unnatural'' and a woman shouldn't earn more than her husband\
  \ as he is supposed to be the ''provider''. \n\nI announced my engagement at our\
  \ wedding planning session yesterday evening, and asked Becca if she'd like the\
  \ Maid of Honour job. She refused which I respect, but without my asking gave her\
  \ reason: That she doesn't support me marrying Tom and never will. \n\nI was furious\
  \ and called her out on her hypocrisy. She tried to get in her usual ''but it's\
  \ DIFFERENT when the guy is older'' but I didn't want to hear it. I stormed out\
  \ in tears. \n\nTom is the most lovely guy I've ever met. He treats me like a princess,\
  \ makes me feel like the most special person in the world. For years now I've bit\
  \ my tongue as Becca spits her vile views in my face, and I'm sick of it. She humiliated\
  \ me in front of the entire bridal party. \n\nI'm not sure where this leaves the\
  \ wedding now. I will always be Becca's friend and want to be there on her big day,\
  \ so I don't know if I chose a bad time to confront her on her behaviour."
