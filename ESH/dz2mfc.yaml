selftext: "My husband and our two kids were playing at at a park across the street\
  \ from a library. We were leaving and crossing the street to head to our car. The\
  \ street is a one way street and there is a crosswalk in the middle. This is not\
  \ a major city or anything. We are a university town with 95 thousand while school\
  \ is in session, and traffic was light at this time. \n\n\_My 5-year-old daughter\
  \ and I were crossing\_the street together and we were on the sidewalk right across\
  \ from our car. Rather than walk to the cross walk, I instructed my daughter to\
  \ visually assess for cars and since there were none in sight, we crossed quickly.\
  \ This made my husband livid.\_\n\nHe said I was endangering our daughter by failing\
  \ to teach her to go to the crosswalk. He said teaching her to cross the street\
  \ correctly is something I should be able to do because teaching the kids is my\
  \ \"only job\" and I failed. I explained that I instructed our daughter to visually\
  \ assess for danger, looking both ways, before crossing and I thought this was adequate\
  \ for this situation. He said it wasn't and that I didn't know how to teach her\
  \ because I \"grew up playing in junkyards;\" (I grew up very poor and did in fact\
  \ play in a junkyard as a child.) He then said I didn't know how to cross the street\
  \ correctly because no one cared enough to teach me how. And then he said literally\
  \ every mother would agree with him that I was incompetent and reckless for crossing\
  \ the street this way.\_\n\n\nHe said all of this in front of our children who are\
  \ 5 and 2.\_\n\nI guess I'm just wondering if what he\_said\_was true and necessary\_\
  because\_I'm\_an\_asshole\_for\_jaywalking or if it crossed a line. \n\nInsight\
  \ appreciated."
