selftext: "my mother in law is a horrible person who loves to create drama whenever\
  \ she can. \n\nlast Christmas we got both of our kids different gifts as one was\
  \ a 13 year old girl and one is a 10 year old boy. \nmy mil (mother in law) decided\
  \ to tell my daughter that she didn't get as many gifts as my brother and that we\
  \ spent less on her. \nbasically trying to get our daughter to believe that we loved\
  \ her less. \nwe then had to deal with a crying 13 year old on Christmas. \n\nshe\
  \ has also brought super expensive gifts for people specifically to upstage everyone,\
  \ she will even make a point of mentioning how much it is in front of people. \n\
  \nshe called up to ask what we will be doing for Christmas as it's our turn, I mentioned\
  \ that me and my wife want to have a potluck at our place. \nshe then proceeded\
  \ to explain to me how we shouldn't let some family members cook certain food because\
  \ of some instances where they fucked up and ruined the dish (this is all completely\
  \ false information that she is mentioning to try and start some more family drama)\n\
  \nI then decided to put my foot down and told my wife that I do not want her at\
  \ our house starting drama on Christmas and that her phone call was the last straw.\
  \ \n\nwife is completely against it and thinks I'm being incredibly cruel to her\
  \ mum, and doesn't want to exclude her.\n\nEDI.\n\nI have tried to talk to her and\
  \ she doesn't care."

  Christmas.
