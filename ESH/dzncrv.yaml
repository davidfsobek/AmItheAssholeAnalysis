selftext: 'So for Thanksgiving every year my wife makes a big tray of Oreo lasagna
  for the family for dessert. Well I purchased a massive thing of Oreos in a giant
  bulk box for her while shopping and the recipe for her Oreo lasagna doesn''t need
  the entire box of bulk in order to make it. So I started picking away at the Oreos
  and eating some. Well she saw me eating them and then told me not to touch them
  until after she made the recipe for Thanksgiving. I explained that there was plenty
  in the bulk box for us to snack on them, yet she still told me no more.


  Well of course, since Oreos are delicious, I didn''t stop. A few days later she
  caught me eating Oreos and milk again while watching TV. So she then takes the Oreos
  away from me while I''m eating them to put them back. I kinda rolled my eyes and
  said "Come on not this again, there are plenty of Oreos!" She then went on about
  how I should just eat what is left over because she wanted to make sure she had
  enough for Thanksgiving. Then I said, "whatever it''s fine, I want Oreos if you
  need more I will go and get more." Boom, problem solved.


  Well apparently not. So I figured by saying I would buy more if we needed this would
  solve the issue but nope. I went to get my Oreos back, grabbed some from the box
  and then my wife snags my arm and demanded that I give her the box to hide from
  me. I told her no and to let go of me. She refused to let go of my arm and demanded
  for the box. We went back and forth like this for a moment before I gave up snapped
  my arm out of her grip because she would refuse to let go of me and went back to
  watching TV and then I started to ignore her because I thought she was being unreasonable.


  I told my sister about our fight and she told me that I was being extremely childish
  about this but I don''t think its a big deal at all. AITA in this situation?

  EDIT: One thing I''d like to add because apparently everyone seems to think my wife
  is doing everything for Thanksgiving. I''m not some lazy do nothing slob around
  the house and I''m going to be cooking something else as well for dinner this holiday.'
