selftext: "I know, the title makes me sound like a major a-hole, but I couldn't think\
  \ of a better way to say it. \n\nFor context, I (26f) work for a moderately sized\
  \ software startup, so our office culture and attire is pretty casual. I grew up\
  \ kind of poor, and my mom raised us with the mindset of \"we can't afford to be\
  \ cheap\" ie, if you're only going to buy one pair of shoes all year, those shoes\
  \ better last. As an adult that's definitely translated into a quality over quantity\
  \ mindset, so my wardrobe is mostly well made, but pretty minimalist (and I think\
  \ stylish tbh) staples. \n\nThere's a woman in my office (late 30's) who mostly\
  \ wears clothing from hot topic, lots of nightmare before Christmas stuff, tights\
  \ with cats/other large patterns, lacy and corset like items. She's made some remarks\
  \ in the past about how she often sees me in the same few outfits, or how I often\
  \ repeat things. Usually I just ignore them or brush them off but I have to be honest\
  \ I was already in a salty mood when I ran into her in our kitchen. \n\nI was wearing\
  \ an outfit I wear fairly regularly (oversize white button down, black jeans, black\
  \ boots)\n\nMe: Hi (coworker)\n\nHer: Hi OP\n\nMe:\\*begins making my cup of tea\\\
  *\n\nHer: Wearing the same thing again, have you thought about mixing it up? \n\n\
  Me: No, I'm pretty happy with my wardrobe as is\n\nHer: Continues to talk about\
  \ how I should really add some color and pattern to my wardrobe, and how my clothes\
  \ right now are so boring. \n\nMe:(probably being an asshole) Well some of us just\
  \ prefer dressing like adults. \n\nI walked back to my desk after that and found\
  \ out later that she'd emailed my boss (who is her boss's, boss's boss) that I had\
  \ been hostile to her and was thinking about making a complaint to HR (I told my\
  \ boss my side of what happened and we're all good, but I'll probably have to talk\
  \ to our HR rep to give my side). \n\nI know I probably should have just walked\
  \ away, but I want to know, was I the AH here?"
