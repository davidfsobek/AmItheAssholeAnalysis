selftext: "Throwaway Acct. Not new to Reddit.  \n\nI **[Male, 31]** am a Sr. Administrative\
  \ Assistant and Undergraduate Registrar at an American university.  I built and\
  \ maintain the department's website, handle our social media, book travel for our\
  \ faculty and guest lecturers, process honorarium payments, reimburse personal expenses,\
  \ process expense reports, list all our courses, track all our students grades and\
  \ progress in the major, handle all work requests, hire student workers to assist\
  \ me in the office, on-board new faculty and a whole lot more. \n\nTo the heart\
  \ of this issue; there are many older faculty members who have been in the department\
  \ since the 70's and remember a time when they had secretaries.  Many of them will\
  \ make a mistake now and then and refer to me as a secretary.  Oh well, shit happens.\
  \ We do not have any secretaries here at this point, and there is a genuine difference\
  \ between a secretary and an administrative assistant.  Aside from the dated connotations\
  \ behind the word secretary, I am not a receptionist.  I have an office with a door\
  \ that locks, I set my own hours and can even work from home when needed.\n\nOne\
  \ professor has, for the last 4 years I have been in this role, often referred to\
  \ me as *his* personal secretary.  He is currently the chair of the department (just\
  \ started his appointment this fall), and will do things like: \u201CDear guest,\
  \ please continue this correspondence with my secretary, cc\u2019d on this conversation\u201D\
  , or will come by my office to ask, \u201Cwhat are you and the other secretaries\
  \ up to this weekend\u201D.  He is mid 60\u2019s and not insanely old or out of\
  \ touch and it always seems to be incredibly intentional.  \n\nI have politely asked\
  \ him to not refer to me as his secretary at least 10 times, and my Operations Manager\
  \ has spoken with him about it.  Two WEEKS ago, I had enough after he said to another\
  \ professor \u201Cisn\u2019t our secretary fantastic! They really don\u2019t make\
  \ them like they used to!\u201D (note I am 31 years old so\u2026 not *that* old).\
  \  I reported this along with documentation from previous offenses to HR and it\
  \ escalated to the point that he has been *asked* (re: told) to step down as chair\
  \ before the start of next semester.  He also has to attend some 30 hours of training.\
  \  \n\nOther admin asst.\u2019s and sundry staff have heard about all of this and\
  \ are adamant that I am an asshole for costing him a prestigious posting (and the\
  \ money that comes with it) and that I needed to just suck it up because he is a\
  \ product of a different era.  I feel that I worked hard to get where I am and take\
  \ pride in my role.  Even if I was a receptionist I do not think that *secretary*\
  \ has much of a place in modern lingo.\n\n**EDIT** weeks not months\n\n**EDIT EDIT**\
  \ I am a man, added to the top as well.\n\n**THE RETURN OF THE EDIT** I do not take\
  \ offense to being called secretary so much as I take offense to him refusing to\
  \ respect my 10+ polite requests *not* to be called it. Most faculty refer to by\
  \ my name, the rest as the admin.  Some call me the registrar if I am fulfilling\
  \ that role.  \n\nI even included that randomly other professors have called me\
  \ secretary and I move on, as shit happens.  His specifically was repeated and on\
  \ purpose, in defiance of polite requests and a request from my supervisor. That\
  \ is what sucks and what my issue is with him."
title: AITA For repeatedly correcting, and finally reporting, a faculty member who
  continues to call me a secretary when I am a Sr. Administrative Assistant?
