selftext: "Hear me out. My sil (sister in law)  has lived with my wife and I for the\
  \ passed three years due to  my wife\u2019s family not being the most supportive.\
  \ She was basically forced out when she was 18 so my wife asked her to move in with\
  \ us. She wanted to be sure her sister could have a good education and future, as\
  \ my wife had also been kicked out and partially robbed of a collage experience\
  \ and a joyful early adolescence due to how rough her life was. Cut to now, sil\
  \ is a college student with very good grades and she works hard in school, here\u2019\
  s the problem. In these three years my sil has never paid rent or contributed financially\
  \ to the household, just the occasional $20 for groceries. That\u2019s it. I have\
  \ mentioned it before only to be met with her having a full scale breakdown about\
  \ how broke she is. How hard her life is how we don\u2019t understand exct. But\
  \ that would be so bad if you think \u201Chuh well it must be nice having extra\
  \ help around the house right?\u201D Nope, every time my wife and I have asked her\
  \ to help she either leaves the house, says she has homework and goes away for hours\
  \ in her room or has a full scale breakdown again. She is constantly telling my\
  \ wife how awful the house looks and how dishes \u201Cnever seem to be done\u201D\
  \ but honestly my wife is a stay at home mom of a baby and our child is a very very\
  \ needy kid, she\u2019s doing the best she can. I try to help as much as I can with\
  \ her but my sil is messy, constantly leaving trash out sweeping her bedroom and\
  \ leaving the dirt in the hallway stuff like that. And when ever she is expecting\
  \ company she berates my wife on the appearance of the house. She also isn\u2019\
  t accessible babysitting, we even have paid her to watch our daughter for us and\
  \ within 30 minutes she always calls us freaking out and we have to leave what ever\
  \ we\u2019re doing and come back. She is usually the one offering !!!  All and all\
  \ I feel like I\u2019m being taken advantage of every day. But I\u2019m trapped.\
  \ If we kick her out she\u2019ll likely have to drop out of school, she\u2019d likely\
  \ lose her job because she wouldn\u2019t be able to stay where we live and she\u2019\
  d likely lose her car. All in all it would be absolutely catastrophic for her. She\u2019\
  d also very likely cut ties with my wife who loves her very very Much. But it\u2019\
  s taking a toll on my life and marriage. Is there a kind way to do this? Would I\
  \ be an asshole If I asked her to leave.\n\nedit: I just want to add that my sil\
  \ is generally a lovely person who in most aspects deserves to be successful and\
  \ happy, that\u2019s all we want from her but I just feel like her success is coming\
  \ at the expense of my household happiness.\nEdit 2: since people keep asking, no\
  \ I haven\u2019t spoken to my wife yet. I wanted to get Reddit\u2019s opinion before\
  \ I brought it up b cause I wasn\u2019t sure if it was even an okay think to bring\
  \ up or if I\u2019m just a dick. I\u2019d never ask my sil to leave e without consulting\
  \ my wife.\nEdit 3: every time she\u2019s watched our daughter she\u2019s offered\
  \ to not been asked, some people seem to think Were attempting to force her to watch\
  \ our child. It just makes me mad because she offers, we PAY and then she makes\
  \ us come home within 30 minuets. We no longer accept her offers.\nEdit 3: some\
  \ people seem to be missing this, yes she has a job. She just spends all her money\
  \ on clothes and I really don\u2019t know what else."
