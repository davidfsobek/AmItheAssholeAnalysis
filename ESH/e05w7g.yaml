selftext: "AITA - this happened a few years ago but I randomly thought about it today\
  \ and want to know if I am the asshole. \n\nIn undergrad I lived in a pretty nice\
  \ apartment with 3 other random girls. I was subleasing from a girl so the three\
  \ other girls knew each other, and I was the newbie. \n\nWe had a fridge with pretty\
  \ fragile shelves. For some reason when I opened the door the shelves on the side\
  \ of the door would come tumbling out and everything would fall. it happened to\
  \ me frequently. I made sure I wasn\u2019t opening the door too hard etc etc. No\
  \ matter what I did every week or so the shelves would fall when I opened the door\
  \ so I asked my roommates if they would stop putting glass items on the shelves\
  \ of the door so if it fell nothing would break. They agreed. \n\nOne day I came\
  \ home before class to grab a snack. I had maybe 15 minutes to spare. I opened the\
  \ fridge door and guess what. The shelves fell. One of the girls put her bottle\
  \ of wine on the shelf and it fell and shattered. Glass and wine everywhere. I was\
  \ pissed bc I told them no glass items and I was running late to class and didn\u2019\
  t have time to clean the shit up. I was pissed so I left the mess there. \n\nAbout\
  \ 30 minutes later I guess one of the girls came home and posted in our group chat.\
  \ She asked who made the mess. I said I did and I said I left it there because I\
  \ asked them not to put glass on the side and now it\u2019s not my responsibility\
  \ to clean it up. \nThe other girls said it wasn\u2019t their fault either so they\
  \ wouldn\u2019t clean it. \n\nThe mess sat in the kitchen for about two days.\n\n\
  I came home one day and noticed someone finally cleaned it up. Great. \nI use my\
  \ personal bathroom the next morning and noticed whoever cleaned it placed all the\
  \ broken glass in front of my shower. I asked the group chat who did it. The girl\
  \ confessed. I was pissed, swept up the broken glass and chucked it all over her\
  \ bedroom. \n\nWe got into a an argument and blocked each other. Never spoke to\
  \ each other again. \n\nAITA for not cleaning it up (not about chucking the glass)?\
  \ I still don\u2019t think I initially did anything wrong. The glass may have been\
  \ an asshole move for sure.\n\nEdit : one of the girls was angry and told me I needed\
  \ to buy her a new bottle. I declined, saying it wasn\u2019t my fault or problem.\
  \ Did I owe her a bottle of wine ?"
