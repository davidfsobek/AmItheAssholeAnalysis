selftext: "My friend has a bad habit of checking/using his phone while he drives.\
  \ Whenever we go somewhere together, we take my car, and he usually drives. And\
  \ he always checks his phone while he drives. To text, Snapchat, even to look at\
  \ memes. \n\nI tried telling him before that he shouldn't. He's said he doesn't\
  \ keep his eyes on the phone, that he makes sure to look back up quickly. \n\nWell\
  \ we just left for a trip, he had already been using his phone. We were passing\
  \ a spot in the left lane on our side of a divided section of roads, the right lane\
  \ of our side was backed up. A car pulls out in front of the car in the right lane,\
  \ to turn, right in front of us.\n\nHe whipped to the left to avoid, and quickly\
  \ back to the right to get back in our lane. The cars didn't even touch.\n\nHe obviously\
  \ celebrated. But I couldn't help but feel like my point had been proven. If he\
  \ had been on his phone at that moment, even if he had looked up, there wouldn't\
  \ haven been enough time for him to react. \n\nI said this, and he told me not to\
  \ ruin the mood. Which just pisses me off. We kinda argued about it when I wasn't\
  \ talking to him. He said my fear from the near accident has made \"overzealous\"\
  \ with my safety concerns.\n\nWho's the asshole?"
