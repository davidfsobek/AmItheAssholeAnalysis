selftext: " My little brother was adopted from Ethiopia when he was 5. I was 7 at\
  \ the time. We were really close when were kids but when high school started he\
  \ started to act out, hang out with the wrong group and we drifted apart a bit.\
  \ I was his \u201Clame white\u201D older brother. His grades started to drop and\
  \ he started getting in trouble a lot in school, got caught with weed, etc.  He\
  \ also become really disrespectful to our parents and constantly lied about where\
  \ he was. Our parents weren\u2019t perfect but they tried their best. Honestly they\
  \ treated him better than me  most of the time because he was \u201Cdifferent\u201D\
  \ and \u201Cspecial\u201D despite being rebellious. They always defended him and\
  \ paid more attention to him. Even did everything in their power to get charges\
  \ dropped when he got arrested.\n\n\nTowards the end of high school he finally started\
  \ to straighten up. He took a year off after high school to work for our dad at\
  \ his business and then he eventually went to community college and after a year\
  \ transferred to a 4 year college. (All paid for completely by our parents.) He\u2019\
  s in 3rd year right now and started dating this Ethiopian American girl and getting\
  \ involved in the Ethiopian community at his college/ the city of his college. He\
  \ seems to be doing a lot better. However the rude comments about our parents haven\u2019\
  t stopped. He constantly makes comments about how our parents were ignorant about\
  \ race, tried to whitewash him and did nothing to incorporate Ethiopian culture\
  \ into his upbringing. Like I said, I don\u2019t think our parents were perfect,\
  \ but they clearly loved him a lot, raised him in a super privileged upbringing\
  \ and did everything they could to raise him the best way they could. I just find\
  \ after everything they\u2019ve done for him, his comments just make him sound ungrateful.\n\
  \n\nHim and I were recently talking and he said he was thinking about going to Ethiopia\
  \ with his girlfriend and how he\u2019s always wanted to go. I was like \u201Coh\
  \ that\u2019s cool but I\u2019m sure that\u2019s pretty expensive\u201D and he just\
  \ shrugged and said he\u2019d ask dad for the money and that \u201Che better give\
  \ it up considering him and mom made no effort effort to act like I was Ethiopian\
  \ my whole childhood\u201D this just pissed me off and I went off on him about how\
  \ much he acted like an entitled spoilt brat and how he literally grew up in an\
  \ orphanage before he was adopted and should be more grateful  to our parents for\
  \ all they\u2019ve done for him. \n\n\nHe got mad at me, said I was an asshole who\
  \ had no idea what it was like to be him and stopped talking to me. It\u2019s been\
  \ a week now and he\u2019s still mad at me and won\u2019t talk to me. I honestly\
  \ think I did nothing wrong and he deserved to be called out but idk everyone still\
  \ babies him and I was talking to our cousin about it and he was like \u201Cyou\
  \ can\u2019t say that type of stuff to an adopted kid.\u201D As if him being adopted\
  \ prevents him from being spoiled and ungrateful. \n\nAITA here?"
