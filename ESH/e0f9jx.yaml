selftext: "I (20F) met my best friend (21M) in 2013 when we starred in a movie together.\
  \ We hit it off from the first moment and have been best friends ever since. I had\
  \ some feelings for him and I\u2019m sure he felt the same way, but we agreed to\
  \ maintain our relationship as BFFs, since it\u2019s all too easy to get caught\
  \ in short-term relationships in this industry and maybe never see each other again.\
  \ We didn\u2019t want that to happen. We also promised each other to not let our\
  \ own romantic relationships get in the way of our friendship.\n\n\nI\u2019ve had\
  \ three boyfriends. I just got out of a relationship with my third one last month.\
  \ My best friend got with his second girlfriend (19F) a little over a year ago.\
  \ She just started out in this industry. Sure we hang out less often when one or\
  \ both of us are in a relationship, but we haven\u2019t lost that magical chemistry.\
  \ \n\n\nMy best friend\u2019s current girlfriend has never seemed to like me. She\
  \ acts cold to me even though I treat her with kindness. I\u2019ve also only seen\
  \ my best friend twice these past six months, ever since we finished filming a TV\
  \ series together. I try to make plans for us to hang out together, and he almost\
  \ always declines stating his busy schedule, but it\u2019s quite clear to me that\
  \ his girlfriend is behind all of this.\n\n\nHis girlfriend found out about my recent\
  \ breakup and has probably been more on edge than ever about me. My best friend\
  \ and I had plans to hang out yesterday. However, I didn\u2019t know his girlfriend\
  \ would also come. She came up to me before I could say hi and told me she doesn\u2019\
  t want her boyfriend and I to see each other anymore. I looked at my best friend\
  \ to see if he was going to say something. He was silent. \n\n\nI told her that\
  \ she was being super ridiculous and I will never try to make a move on my best\
  \ friend, even if he were single. His girlfriend told me to shut up and do as she\
  \ said or there will be consequences. I put my foot down for myself and for my best\
  \ friend. I said \u201Cno\u201D. I asked her if the reason she was so scared of\
  \ her boyfriend hanging out with me is because she thinks she is inferior to me.\
  \ She told me \u201Cyou ain\u2019t shit\u201D and dragged her boyfriend away. \n\
  \n\nI have been waiting a few hours for a message from my best friend. Still nothing."
