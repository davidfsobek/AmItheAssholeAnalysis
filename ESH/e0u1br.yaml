selftext: "So I've been married for almost 11 months. I love my husband. We've had\
  \ our share of issues, but we have been trying to work them out. \n\nOne thing that\
  \ has always been an issue between us is education. I have a bachelor's degree and\
  \ am currently working on my masters. He joined the Marine Corp out of high school,\
  \ was out for a year, and then joined the Army. \n\nWhile he was out, he attended\
  \ school for about 3 months. He started in August but quit by Thanksgiving time.\
  \ All paid for by his GI bill. I was happy that he was going to school, he seemed\
  \ super excited about it.\n\nBut since he quit, he constantly talks down about people\
  \ having degrees and how its a waste to spend so much money for a piece of paper.\
  \ This is irritating to me because I feel like I worked hard for my degree and am\
  \ still working hard.\n\nRecently though, I overheard him telling a friend he met\
  \ online video gaming about how he went to school. This isn't the issue but he always\
  \ talks it up like he got far into this degree and that he was doing really well\
  \ in his classes.\n\nI felt like he was a hypocrite for always talking down to me\
  \ about my degree but when he talks to others, he tries to act like he was almost\
  \ finished and like it was a great achievement. So when I heard him say this to\
  \ his friend, I loudly corrected him about the information. \n\nAnd just to mention,\
  \ I have talked about this type of stuff with him before.\n\nAITA for doing this?\
  \ Or for doing it loud enough for his friend to hear?"
