selftext: 'So this is a quick one.


  About an hour ago now my mum called me to the table for dinner. Before heading to
  the dining room, however, I decided that I would relieve myself in the bathroom.
  When I got into the hallway by the bathroom I noticed my sister exiting and thought
  nothing of it and went it to go toilet. I lift up the lid of the toilet and what
  do I see but a massive shit sitting in the toilet. I know that she flushed because
  I could hear it from the hall, yet this bugger went nowhere. She did not think to
  do anything about it either due to ignorance or arrogance. It should also be mentioned
  that this is not the first time she has done this, around the fifth time within
  the past year if my memory serves me correctly. Sadly our toilet does not have a
  poo knife so I had to use the toilet brush to mash it down the drain and then clean
  the brush by flushing the toilet a few times. I made sure to wash my hands thoroughly
  then make my way out to the dining room.


  Upon arriving, my sister immediately blurts out "what took you so long?" And me,
  sick of dealing with her shit(literally). went off at her. The words inconsiderate,
  gross, and animal were used and she promptly left the table from embarrassment.
  My mum told me that I shouldn''t have acted in such a way and that I should apologize,
  I somewhat agree but also think that I shouldn''t have to clean up after her when
  she is an 18-year-old adult. So AITA
