selftext: 'So for context, this friend [27 F] and myself [26 F] have known each other
  since the 3rd grade. She mentioned the idea of going on a mini-vacation together
  since I''m moving to a new state soon. I let her know that I''d be down, but I couldn''t
  spend too much on it because I had a lot of moving expenses coming up and would
  be leaving one of my jobs behind. She agreed that we could do a cheap trip, and
  so I mentioned maybe going to D.C. or Charlotte since we had friends there we could
  stay with and would save us both a ton of money on hotels! She said that she''d
  REALLY prefer to go to Boston instead but that she was willing to pay for the hotel
  since she knew I was trying to save money for my move. Fine. So I went ahead and
  bought our flights and the night before the trip I sent her the breakdown of what
  her half cost, and she responded with "we''ll figure everything out at the airport".
  The next morning I pick her up for the airport, we park, get on the plane, and literally
  as soon as we land I get a text from my mom that I had some kind of parking ticket
  mailed to her house that I now owed $375 or my license was going to be suspended.
  Obviously my mood immediately went to shit because I wasn''t anticipating something
  like that coming up. I got so stressed out that I started tearing up and my friend
  at this point asks me what''s wrong, I tell her, and she says, "don''t worry about
  paying for the hotel I''ll cover it". To which I''m thinking in my head... didn''t
  we already decide that from the beginning? She STILL hasn''t mentioned anything
  about sending me the money for her flight or the parking and just kind of waits
  for me to collect myself and then we go start walking around the city. I would also
  like to mention that this friend of mine is a director at a hospital and makes VERY
  good money, and she talks about it all the time. So anyway, we''re walking around
  and I''m trying to get myself together when all of a sudden we come across a tour.
  The tour costs $45 with tax and my friend INSISTS that she really wants to go. Obviously
  I''m not in a position where paying that much money feels comfortable for me, but
  again, I wanted to be a good friend and so I hesitantly agreed. We get up to the
  cashier and the lady asks us if we''re paying together or separate, to which my
  friend responds, "Separate!". Super fast, and kind of loud. At this point I totally
  shut down and couldn''t bring myself to fake having a good time. We ended up doing
  the trip separately the next day and when we got back home, I sent her a long message
  about how disrespected I felt that she never paid me for her flight, that she had
  zero empathy when I was clearly upset and stressed, and was overall so incredibly
  selfish. I just decided I don''t want friends like that in my life and let her know
  I didn''t think we added any value to each other''s lives and it was time to part
  ways. AITA for totally and completely ending this friendship of 20-years over an
  incident like this?


  EDIT: At the end of the trip I explicitly asked for her to pay for her half of the
  flights and she told me no because she "had a terrible time" due to my lack of enthusiasm
  and was therefore justified in not paying.'
