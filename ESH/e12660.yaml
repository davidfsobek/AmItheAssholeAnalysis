selftext: 'It all started yesterday when my husband called me while I was at work.  He
  told me he had ordered free door dash & he thinks his food was drugged, I asked
  why.  He responded by saying he was hallucinating. That he went to take the garbage
  out and when he went to walk down the stairs of the apartment to the front door
  the whole room was blue (for context everything is white, the stairs, wall, ceiling,
  everything). And the stairs just continued on forever like they were never-ending
  and all the lights int he house were unbearably bright. I asked hey didn''t you
  tell me earlier you had been bitten by a spider? He said yea a couple of hours ago.


  I googled it & the first thing that pops up was a brown recluse which is common
  in southwest  Ohio. I told him the hallucinations were from the spider bite and
  no one had drugged his food.  I looked up some care and told him to follow them
  and when I got home I would look at it. He didn''t have other symptoms like fever
  or nausea and after an hour or so the hallucinations stopped.  Looked okay when
  I got off I said let''s ride it out overnight and see what it looks like in the
  morning.


  In the morning he decided he was fine & went to work (Door dash). I texted him around
  9 am and said please go to urgent care now instead of waiting until later when I
  have to work.  The toddler & I laid down for a nap & around 12 pm he busts in the
  house turns on the bedroom light,l turns off the fan & starts saying "babe look
  at my arm, look at my arm!" At this point, the baby is scared & rudely awoken and
  begins to cry.  I look at it it''s swollen and doesn''t look great but looks fine.
  He freaks out and is saying he''s going to the doctor some guys mom on facebook
  almost died blah blah blah.


  I honestly got angry, I knew he was going to wait last minute even though I asked
  him 3 hours before to please go to the doctor. He starts calling me an asshole shoves
  his phone in my face & demands I call my job & tell them I will probably be late.
  He says I am the asshole because I had no sympathy towards him, I say he''s the
  asshole because he should have gone to the doctor hours before & now I am going
  to be late for work. What do you think Reddit?


  TL;DR Husband was bitten by most likey a brown recluse, he hallucinated but didn''t
  go to the doc. The next day I asked him in the morning to please go to the doctor
  and not wait. Well, he waited & now I am going to be late for work. He says I have
  no sympathy I say he has no respect.

  EDIT The verdict is out but just to clarify My husband was not hallucinating the
  next day. It happened for an hour then stopped. When he woke up the next morning
  & I asked him to go to urgent care he said he was completely fine & it wasn''t necessary.'
