selftext: "It was me, my girlfriend at the time, and 3 of my friends. We were all\
  \ going home from a ski trip and were cutting it close. We get to the airport and\
  \ the security line is really long, but I had TSA Pre-Check so I got through much\
  \ faster. I even told them to cut the line and explain the situation to airport\
  \ security, who will usually accommodate you in these situations, and it was at\
  \ least worth a try. But they decided not to and just went through the security\
  \ line as normal. \n\nAnyways, I get to the gate and they are almost done boarding.\
  \ I tell the airline rep my friends are right behind me and ask if they can hold\
  \ the gate open. She tells me they will close the gate in 3 minutes and I can either\
  \ get on or not. I'm on the phone with my girlfriend updating them of the situation\
  \ and telling them to hurry. In the end, she asks me if I am getting on or not and\
  \ my friends are not there yet, so I make a quick decision and board the plane.\
  \ Needless to say, they missed the flight.\n\nFrom my perspective, I figured my\
  \ girlfriend would be okay since she wasn't alone and she was with my friends, and\
  \ that they would all be together and get on the next available flight. If she was\
  \ by herself or even if it was just a friend by themselves I would like to think\
  \ I would have stayed behind with them. Additionally, we didn't know how many seats\
  \ would be available on the next flight, or when that would be, so me staying behind\
  \ and taking up another potential seat on the next flight could have complicated\
  \ things. In that split second, I figured it would be best to just use the seat\
  \ that is already available and paid for instead of relying on chance and staying\
  \ behind.\n\nMy friends/girlfriend say I ditched them and that I am the asshole.\n\
  \nWould love to know what others think.\n\nEdit:\n\nA couple people have asked why\
  \ we were late to begin with, as that could impact their perspective, so here is\
  \ that backstory that I replied to their comments with:\n\n\u201CThere's a few reasons\
  \ we were late. We decided to get sandwiches before our flight, and the person driving\
  \ didn't follow google maps which could have saved a solid 5-10 mins which would\
  \ have made the difference between making the plane or not. In the end, we still\
  \ actually got to the airport with a decent amount of time before the gate was supposed\
  \ to close (over 1 hour I believe). But the security line was super long.\u201D\n\
  \nMy take on the backstory is that there\u2019s a bunch of decisions that could\
  \ have been made that would have made the difference between catching the flight\
  \ or not. We could have chosen to not get sandwiches (we specifically got sandwiches\
  \ at this place instead of the airport because it was supposed to be a really good/known\
  \ sandwich spot). The driver (one of our friends) could have taken a more optimal\
  \ route. They could have asked security to skip the line. They could have signed\
  \ up for TSA Pre-Check. In the end, none of us knew what was going to happen or\
  \ that the security line was going to be THAT long. In fact, now that I think about\
  \ it, the security line made so many people miss their flights that the airline\
  \ didn\u2019t end up charging for flight reschedules."
