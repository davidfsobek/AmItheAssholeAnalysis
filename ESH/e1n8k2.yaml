selftext: 'My wife is a nervous, compulsive cleaner, and she kind of ~~blacks out~~
  goes on autopilot when she''s picking things up. She is awful at remembering where
  she puts things when she does this and often stuffs things in a closet or drawer.
  A long time ago, I figured out the places she always misses and started stashing
  stuff in those places. A pen so I always have a pen, mail that I haven''t sorted
  yet, a phone charger, etc. Conflict avoided.


  Recently, our daughters figured out the spots they can put things so mom won''t
  clean them away. They started sticking regular stuff as well as earrings and other
  bits of jewelry in them, and the occasional snack.


  On Saturday, my wife busted our 12 year old pulling a granola bar from behind the
  books on the living room bookshelf. I walked into it as our daughter was getting
  mouthy and mean. Daughter was being disrespectful so I backed mom hard, we navigated
  the incident as a united front and established a new rule about food staying in
  the kitchen.


  On Saturday night, I was cross examined about what our daughter said about my wife
  "hiding everybody''s stuff all the time" and about how "everybody hides stuff from
  her because otherwise we can''t find anything" and it was super not fun. I tried
  to be gentle, but we''ve had that talk before and it doesn''t go anywhere helpful
  (thus the hiding things solution) and I could tell she was hurt. She says she feels
  like there''s a rat''s nest of gross mess hidden in every room and it makes her
  really uncomfortable.


  I told her I understand her need to have her house a certain way so she can feel
  at home in her own home, but a house is a functional thing that needs to serve everybody''s
  needs, and her asserting control over every nook and cranny in the house makes it
  so the rest of us can''t use the house the way we need to in order to feel at home
  in *our* home. We don''t *want* to hide stuff, we want to be able to put it down
  without it walking away to nobody-knows-where.


  On Sunday, she tidied the whole house and all of our stuff has been put away in
  places we can''t find. She was paying attention when she did this so she can actually
  tell us where everything is this time when we ask, but I feel like she''s being
  unnecessarily smug about it and she definitely seems to feel like she''s not the
  asshole here. AITA for doing the best I could with the problem?


  On proofreading I think I should make it clear that my wife and I both work and
  the four of us have a healthily split chore list. My wife is not slaving away cleaning
  up after three messy, ungrateful babies. It''s me, her, a 12 year old girl, and
  a 14 year old girl and frankly I clean the most.'
