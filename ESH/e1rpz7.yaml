selftext: "Some backstory:\nMy family recently moved into a brand new house, and a\
  \ lot of things are still being worked on. Including our backyard. There are no\
  \ fences yet, but there are creases that quiet clearly indicate the property lines.\n\
  \nRecently, my neighbours have put a badminton net on their lawn. The problem is\
  \ that they attached the supports in the middle of our lawn. \n\n\nWhen we first\
  \ saw this, we were confused like, wtf  is that. We decided to go ask the neighbours\
  \ about it, and they said it would just be temporary until the fences came up.\n\
  \nThe problem is that I can't do anything in my backyard anymore. My grass is getting\
  \ long, but I can't cut it because of the nets' supports. Everytime I look outside,\
  \ I get annoyed because their net is on our side.\n\nI decided to go talk to them\
  \ again about it, but they said the same thing.\n\nI've been getting more and more\
  \ frustrated and have thought about cutting the part of the net that's on our side.\n\
  \nWIBTA?\n\nEdit: ok so I guess I will be the asshole if I decide to cut it. Thanks\
  \ to some comments, I'll just remove it and put it on their property. Thanks Reddit."
