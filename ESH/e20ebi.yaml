selftext: "My friends from work and I are pretty laid back about treating each other\
  \ when we go out. Like, if we go for drinks, we'll take turns buying everyone a\
  \ round, if we go to the movies, one of us will get all the tickets, another will\
  \ get food for everyone to share, etc. If we're hanging out at someone's house,\
  \ everyone will bring booze and food, and leave the leftovers behind.\n\nSo at any\
  \ one event, some people will end up paying more than others, but over time it all\
  \ evens out. Nobody in the group mooches and we really do take turns covering things\
  \ for the group. \n\nIt's started to get awkward when I've invited my boyfriend\
  \ around, he's very diligent about always splitting the bill fairly; when he and\
  \ his friends go out they'll keep all the receipts, use an app to take down who\
  \ paid for what and who drank or used what, and calculate who owes who. Then they'll\
  \ settle the bill between themselves. When I've hung with them, I'll be a part of\
  \ this even though it's a bit of a hassle.\n\nAnyway, when my boyfriend hangs out\
  \ with my friends and I, he started out offering to pay people for stuff, like asking\
  \ whoever bought a round of drinks how much his cost and what their venmo was. Everyone\
  \ was like \"don't worry about it\" \n\nSo he stopped asking about that, but he's\
  \ also never offered to get the group stuff. I started to notice and when we were\
  \ out, I asked him to get a round of drinks, and he asked if he could get cash from\
  \ everyone. I was like \"no, everyone's bought you plenty last few times we hung\
  \ out, just get this one\" and he said he wasn't doing it unless he got paid back.\n\
  \nI started noticing more after that, that he always accepts drinks and event tickets\
  \ and stuff and never covers stuff for the group. So that stuff isn't unfair I've\
  \ bought the group more on his behalf but it's been me paying.\n\nI said that he's\
  \ gotta start buying a round of drinks sometime, or tickets for an event or food\
  \ or something. If he wants to hang with us.\n\nAnd he took it the wrong way, thinking\
  \ I was hiding something, trying to keep him from hanging with my friends.\n\nAITA\
  \ for saying what I did?"
title: AITA for saying my boyfriend has got to buy my friend group a round of drinks
  or something sometimes, if he wants to hang with us?
