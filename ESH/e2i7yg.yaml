selftext: "Here\u2019s the backstory:\n\nA couple of years ago I moved abroad to a\
  \ Latin American country. I haven\u2019t really gone home to the US a lot because\
  \ it\u2019s expensive. So when I do go home, obviously my family are excited. So\
  \ far I\u2019ve gone home twice in 2 \xBD-ish years. \n\nSo, the problem is that\
  \ when I have gone home, twice now, we always have a family dinner so I can see\
  \ everyone (not just my parents). And each time I\u2019ve gone home, the family\
  \ dinner was Mexican food. Once we went to a Mexican restaurant and once my sibling\
  \ cooked a meal for us. \n\nI was pretty vocal the first time that, could we please\
  \ go to anything but Mexican? I eat typical and local food where I live and that\
  \ means rice and beans everyday. So, when I go home and have a selection of different\
  \ food options, I\u2019d like to take a break from rice and beans by not going to\
  \ a Mexican restaurant. \n\nSo, first time my dad was upset that I was whining about\
  \ eating Mexican, so I just dropped it but was still upset about it. But the second\
  \ time I went home, family dinner was again Mexican food. This time my sibling cooked.\
  \ I again tried to say and very much more upset this time around, that I\u2019d\
  \ really like to not have to eat rice and beans when I\u2019m home too. \n\nI then\
  \ got yelled at by my parents who said I was ungrateful that meals were provided\
  \ for me when I went home. And I said, yes but it\u2019s family dinner. So I\u2019\
  m not the only person who gets a free meal. And I said, couldn\u2019t you easily\
  \ throw pasta in a pot too or literally anything except Mexican food. Literally,\
  \ burgers, hot dogs...just something that is not what I eat every single day of\
  \ the year. But again, I was told I\u2019m ungrateful. \n\nI\u2019m due to go home\
  \ after the holidays, so no special meals and am not looking forward to be eating\
  \ Mexican food again. \n\n\nSo, AITA for complaining that every time I go home we\
  \ always eat Mexican food when I would like to not eat rice and bean dishes, since\
  \ I live full time in a Latin American country and eat typical dishes everyday there?"
