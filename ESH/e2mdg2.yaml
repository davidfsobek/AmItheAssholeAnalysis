selftext: "Known this family friend for 5 yrs. I\u2019ve tried to get her to leave\
  \ her rude, abusive boyfriend before, but she always went back to him. She works\
  \ at a motel, and her dream was to go to Medschool. I helped her apply to our undergrad\
  \ last year. She got in, but called me crying because didn\u2019t know how to do\
  \ FAFSA or where to live. She told me she left her bf.  I told her I\u2019d help.\
  \ I did all her FAFSA for her, and got her loans to go to classes. I told her she\
  \ could move in with me. My rent was 900, but I said she could pay 200 since I know\
  \ how hard the move, and leaving her shit bf was going to be. \n\nShe didn\u2019\
  t leave her bf, but she still moved in with her dog. She constantly complained that\
  \ she wasn\u2019t smart enough to do blackboard/homework and that she didn\u2019\
  t have the time (she def did tho). I signed her up for blackboard, and taught her\
  \ how to use it. I even did her homework, and then would explain it to her. I tutored\
  \ her everyday on every class. She went from making 30\u2019s in classes to As.\
  \ \n\nShe claimed her dog was too much work, and she couldn\u2019t deal with him\
  \ on top of all this. So I started walking her dog, and then feeding her dog and\
  \ then somehow I was the one that ended up paying her his food/vet bills. \n\nI\
  \ moved my schedule to be in her lab when she told me she couldn\u2019t do it alone,\
  \ that she\u2019d fail. She complained she couldn\u2019t cook for herself, so I\
  \ use to cook her lunches/dinners and leave them out for her. I paid for all the\
  \ groceries. Months went by, and she hadn\u2019t paid rent. I reminded her over\
  \ and over again but she\u2019d cry and I felt bad. It got to the point where she\u2019\
  d just tell me to do her homework, or make dinner, like I was her slave and not\
  \ her friend. \n\nEventually my abusive mom that I hadn\u2019t talked to in ages\
  \ messaged me screenshots of them talking. She was shit talking me. She told my\
  \ mom I\u2019m too stupid to even go to Medschool, how did they accept me. She said\
  \ my cooking was terrible, and made remarks on my appearance. I went to my friends\
  \ and showed them, and they were basically like, \u201Cshe shit talks you all the\
  \ time, dude. she is using you, and you don\u2019t even see it.\u201D\n\nI confronted\
  \ her with everything, said we couldn\u2019t be friends anymore, but that she needed\
  \ to pay me all the rent she\u2019s missed by the end of the week or go. She cried,\
  \ but I didn\u2019t fall for it. She told me she\u2019d never pay me rent, and I\
  \ told her to leave. She didn\u2019t even take her stuff, just grabbed the dog and\
  \ texted me pictures of her sleeping in her car and how terrible I was for doing\
  \ this to me. \n\nShe texted me a week afterwords and said if I didn\u2019t let\
  \ her move back in she\u2019d tell the cops I had illegal drugs in the house (they\
  \ were hers, she hid them in the house). I got so pissed, I threw all her stuff\
  \ in the trash, and then I dropped her out of her classes. I was so mad. She can\
  \ undo it, but I knew she was too lazy to go through the process. I was right. It\u2019\
  s been two months. I went back home and saw her working at the motel again, and\
  \ she\u2019s living with asshole bf. I feel like I fucked up her schooling.\n\n\
  Edit: I also want to add because it is absolutely dumbfounding. She is 29 years\
  \ old. I\u2019m 20, and yet I\u2019m the one having to do her homework, clean, cook,\
  \ pay rent, take care of the dog.... It makes no sense that I let her treat me like\
  \ a slave, and I have no explanation for why I let her do that."
