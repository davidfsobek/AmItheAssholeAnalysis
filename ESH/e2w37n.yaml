selftext: "This happened an hour ago. My husband isn\u2019t talking to me. I need\
  \ objective opinions!\n\nBackground - we both work full-time in stressful jobs.\
  \ However, he gets far more down time than I do. I do all of the food shopping,\
  \ cooking, the vast majority of the dishes, plus the majority of the inside cleaning\
  \ (I don\u2019t think he\u2019s cleaned a toilet or bathroom the whole time we\u2019\
  ve lived together - he\u2019ll vacuum, but not often and not at all lately). He\
  \ does the outside but it\u2019s low maintenance so it\u2019s mainly a small patch\
  \ of lawn that he mows every few weeks. Basically 95% of the time he finishes work,\
  \ flops on the bed and watches YouTube/plays clash of clans until dinner time/bed\
  \ time. I used to be resentful of this but after years of it, despite communication,\
  \ I\u2019m pretty immune.\n\nAnyway, the cream cheese incident! As I said, I\u2019\
  m the one who does the food shopping. When I\u2019m putting groceries away, I do\
  \ a mini-clean out of the fridge to make sure there\u2019s nothing gross in there\
  \ but some things up the back can get missed on occasion, I admit. My husband is\
  \ obsessed with things that might be \u2018gross\u2019 in the fridge. He makes comments\
  \ all the time that things in there are so old and he\u2019s \u2018scared\u2019\
  \ of them. He\u2019ll do this thing where he\u2019ll stand with the fridge open,\
  \ sigh, examine things like they\u2019re poison, and then ask me if they\u2019re\
  \ ok or not. I tell him a) I clean the fridge when I shop every week so the things\
  \ in there should be fine and b) if it\u2019s something I\u2019ve missed by accident,\
  \ I\u2019m sure he can judge/check the use by date without getting me involved.\
  \ Like any normal adult. I admit that because it\u2019s my (unofficial) territory\
  \ that this irritates the heck out of me and I feel absolutely like he\u2019s being\
  \ judgemental of the job that I do, even though he insists that he\u2019s not...\n\
  \nCut to this afternoon. Cue the above behaviour from my husband, cue my irritation.\
  \ He has a tub of cream cheese in his hand, which I know for a fact is ok because\
  \ I bought it specifically to make bagels a few days ago. He\u2019s turning it over\
  \ in his hands, examining it, scowling at it, and yes, I\u2019d had enough. I went\
  \ to grab it out of his hands but I missed and it fell on the floor - an accident\
  \ - and then I picked it up off the floor, walked it over to the bin, and threw\
  \ it in. I didn\u2019t yell; actually, I didn\u2019t say a word. Husband then asks\
  \ me what the hell I did that for.. I didn\u2019t answer, he stomped away and shut\
  \ the bedroom door.\n\nI admit that I was TA for my actions, but honestly I snapped.\
  \ I did go into the bedroom and say that I did a shitty thing and I apologise, that\
  \ I find his behaviour irritating but I shouldn\u2019t have reacted like that. He\
  \ didn\u2019t accept my apology, isn\u2019t speaking to me and won\u2019t acknowledge\
  \ me at all.. We were supposed to be having a date night tonight.\n\nReddit, who\u2019\
  s TA here currently? I feel like because I did a stupid thing, admitted it, and\
  \ apologised I shouldn\u2019t be getting the silent treatment like this. What say\
  \ you?"
