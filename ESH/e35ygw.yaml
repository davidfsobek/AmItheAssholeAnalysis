selftext: "My daughter (I'll call her Becky) is a great girl. She's 21 and very pretty,\
  \ a really happy kid who the whole family adores. She's very intelligent, sat her\
  \ exams early at school, gained top marks and got into an economics course at a\
  \ great place where her grades remain excellent. \n\nUnfortunately while her grades\
  \ are high, there have been some problems since she has been away studying. She's\
  \ told us that she's been in trouble for missing deadlines and has had to ask for\
  \ an extension numerous times. She always produces work to a high standard but often\
  \ misses course deadlines because (in her own words) she just couldn't be bothered\
  \ to do the work on time. \n\nIn addition, she has been smoking weed (illegal in\
  \ this country though I don't have a problem with it) since she was 14, and frequently\
  \ has her drug dealer deliver to her accommodation, which has meant the police knocking\
  \ on her door on a regular basis too. \n\nLastly, she has been in trouble for bullying\
  \ several girls on her course. Her faculty and other university officials have warned\
  \ her about this. We did have some issues with her bullying others when she was\
  \ in school, but the teachers were never able to prove anything and we had no reason\
  \ to disbelieve her when she said she was innocent. \n\nRecently she was suspended,\
  \ and was told she would be put in front of a disciplinary panel after yet another\
  \ bunch of bullying accusations from various girls. She knows that the most likely\
  \ outcome with her record is expulsion and she is terrified. She's been sobbing\
  \ to my wife over video call the last few days. \n\nBecky wants us to come and support\
  \ her when she's in front of the panel. She's so scared, but as her father I'm so\
  \ disappointed in her that she threw away such a great opportunity. It's not that\
  \ I don't want to support her but I'm very frustrated with her. Her mother can go\
  \ there, but I think a bit of tough love is needed and she needs to know how disappointed\
  \ we are."
