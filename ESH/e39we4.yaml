selftext: 'I make good money as a dentist. We really don''t need to make more money
  and live very comfortably. My thing is that my wife does nothing all day. We have
  two kids in elementary school, but we have a sitter. We also have a cleaning service.
  I''ve had this conversation with her a couple of years ago that once the youngest
  started 2nd grade, then she would get a job or something. She''s saying that someone
  has to run the house and wants to be involved with the kids'' school which is funny
  because she probably volunteers like five hours a week and just tends to the school
  garden. She just doesn''t want to work. It''s not about the money. Our family doesn''t
  need her at home 24/7. To be honest, she doesn''t get anything done and often complains
  when she has to step in for the hired help when they can''t work. I still find time
  to assistant coach my kids'' sports and attend every game and most practices. I
  wash dishes and do laundry and I don''t complain. I feel like we should either get
  rid of the hired help so she can do it or she needs to get a job. She has this circular
  argument that if she gets a job then who will run the house and why should she work
  when I make so much money? Now she''s saying that she wants to dedicate herself
  to our son''s acting "career" which is as existent as her career. I don''t like
  where this is going.

  FYI - she used to do clerical work and there is no way in Hell do I want her or
  any family involved with my practice.'
