selftext: "So after a long night of games and eating leftover turkey at my aunts house,\
  \ we finally decided to go home at around 3am. I took my GF home and stayed to charge\
  \ my phone ( I ordered an Uber to her house and was charging my phone in her living\
  \ room so I can have some battery life on the way back home from her house)\n\n\
  Well her and I decided to  wait in the living room while my phone was charging and\
  \ started having a long conversation, we were both whispering as low as we can but\
  \ enough for us to hear each other, we didn\u2019t laugh loud or cause any sort\
  \ of unnecessary disturbances, we strictly just had a conversation.\n\nMy GF said\
  \ it was okay because we were just charging my phone anyways and were being quiet\
  \ (but her parents have the hearing of a fucking K9)\n\nWell her step dad apparently\
  \ was awoken by the sound of us talking (they left their room for open)\nAnd got\
  \ into an argument about me being there because I was just letting my phone charge\
  \ with her mom, and he got up and got ready for work, when seeing him I said hi\
  \ like I usually do because I didn\u2019t want to just ignore him and be rude. He\
  \ didn\u2019t say anything and just continued to get ready and walked into the bathroom.\n\
  \nMy GF and I were getting very open and just discussing difficult topics and it\
  \ was pretty serious but enjoyable because I like to hear her opinions. Anyways,\
  \ her step dad comes back into the room and tells me that me bringing her home at\
  \ 3am (she is 19 years old btw) and talking was very rude of me and because it was\
  \ his day off and he was woken up at 3 am, which is the time he usually gets up\
  \ for work anyways, then decided to go because his day was already ruined by me\
  \ because he got into an argument with her mom.\n\nI tried to apologize as he was\
  \ walking away and he just walked out the front door to work and basically blamed\
  \ me that he won\u2019t be spending his day with his wife because they are arguing\
  \ rn.\n\nI feel like an ass because of it and just feel like I shouldn\u2019t go\
  \ around anymore because of the bad impression I made.\n\nMy GF and I have been\
  \ together for a while now, I get me staying was an issue and I didn\u2019t mean\
  \ to overstay my welcome if I even was welcome at this point, so idk I guess I\u2019\
  m wondering if AITA\n\nEDIT 1:  for everyone asking WHY I was at her house, I ordered\
  \ the Uber from her home to my aunts, then I got an UBER POOL (which only Allows\
  \ 1 stop per ride) to her house after we ate dinner. Also my GF doesn\u2019t feel\
  \ comfortable riding in a strangers car by herself so she wanted me to come with\
  \ her to make sure she got home safe due to a lot of kidnappings going on in lately.\n\
  \nOn the way to her house my phone was dead and she had a charger inside her house,\
  \ and it was about 45 degrees outside, so we decided that the living room would\
  \ be the best spot to charge it because if I went into her room, I\u2019d probably\
  \ be strangled lol.\n\n\nAlso; I don\u2019t know why some of you guys assumed we\
  \ are drunk/ that we drank alcohol. Nowhere in the text did I insist on that nor\
  \ is that true. We literally ate turkey, and the most we drank was a can of Dr Pepper.\
  \ We were not drunk.\n\nThank you to everyone who took the time to reply. I knew\
  \ I was the ass for waking them up but my GF felt bad and kept telling me her stepdad\
  \ is just a dick for absolutely no reason. However, my intention was to simply charge\
  \ my phone and leave, and I did."
