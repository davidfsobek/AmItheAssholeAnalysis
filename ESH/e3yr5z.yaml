selftext: "My daughter Anna is 10. Since she was little she has been a really bright\
  \ kid, picking everything up much faster than expected. She could speak in full\
  \ sentences when others could barely speak at all. When she was 5 her teacher (who\
  \ has taught for 30+ years) said she's the brightest kid he's ever taught. She has\
  \ always smashed her targets and always been top of her class. She's doing really\
  \ well at school. Her teachers all love her and she has lots of friends who she\
  \ gets along really well with. \n\nMy sister has a son the same age, Tommy. Nice\
  \ lad who goes to the same school as Anna. They're in the same year but not the\
  \ same class and they have different friendship groups so don't hang out often.\
  \ Unfortunately he's not as gifted as Anna. He struggles academically and his grades\
  \ are often below average. \n\nThe school held assessments recently (not official\
  \ tests just assessments to see what level everyone is working at). Anna did really\
  \ well at everything as we expected. Tommy, also, met his targets in his tests too.\
  \ The targets weren't that high but the targets are personal. Anna got the highest\
  \ grades across the board. \n\nYesterday evening we all went to my sister's place.\
  \ My parents attended, but they briefly left to do some christmas shopping. Anna\
  \ and Tommy wanted to go with them which they said yes to. \n\nWhen they came back\
  \ they were both in tears. They were selling giant cuddly toys and they both wanted\
  \ one. My parents didn't bring too much money and could only buy one and chose Tommy,\
  \ because they were ''so proud'' that he managed to hit his target grades. Anna\
  \ spent the return the car journey crying and calling him mean things like dumb\
  \ and ugly which made him cry too. \n\nWhen my parents told me their decision I\
  \ saw red. So the kid who only just manages to get average grades gets rewarded,\
  \ and the kid who exceeds all her targets and is the best in her year gets nothing?\
  \ I was absolutely fuming and had a go at my parents for their bad decision. \n\n\
  We left early and my husband tried to say that I was overly harsh and that I should\
  \ consider their point of view. I'm sorry but no. They chose Tommy over Anna even\
  \ though Anna achieved more. It was unfair and unkind. She sobbed in the car and\
  \ when we got home, and I had to promise to buy her a giant cuddly toy first chance\
  \ I get. \n\nAm I wrong to be angry or did they have a point?"
title: AITA for being annoyed that my parents are favouring my sister's kid over mine?
