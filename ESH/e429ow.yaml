selftext: "The title sounds bad, I know.  But let me explain.\n\nMy cousin's oldest\
  \ child has been in therapy and anger management for about two years.  Thanksgiving\
  \ two years ago, this kid broke my brand new Nintendo Switch after I didn't want\
  \ her playing with it and hiding it away.  We were going to start dinner and ran\
  \ out of time.  Her brother was using it and we couldn't get to her turn.  I promised\
  \ after dinner, but she threw a fit which resulted in the switch getting thrown\
  \ out of my uncle's second story window, narrowly missing a dog-walker in Brooklyn.\
  \  My cousin didn't want to pay and that was a whole other fight. The \"she's just\
  \ a kid, and you're too old for a game console anyway\" argument.\n\nAnyway.\n\n\
  This year we were all guaranteed that Gabby was doing much better.  Her temper has\
  \ gone down (supposedly) and she will be on her best behavior.  My aunt and uncle\
  \ moved out to Long Island from Brooklyn to be closer to family, so we are in their\
  \ new home in their dining room.\n\nMy cousin just gave birth this summer to her\
  \ third child and was busy feeding him, so she couldn't help Gabby as quickly as\
  \ her daughter wanted.  I am sitting on the other end of the table talking to my\
  \ grandma.  We are all hearing, \"Mom, mom......Mooooom....MMMOOOOOOOMMMMM.\"  Then\
  \ a screech that a pterodactyl would be proud of and a shattering of glass.  My\
  \ cousin's phone is laying among the wreckage of my aunt's curio cabinet which had\
  \ all her late mother's original Swarovsky crystal figurines that she inherited.\
  \  The only surviving one is that little classic mouse.  Otherwise the swans, parrots,\
  \ roses, etc.  A good few thousands of dollars shattered.\n\nEveryone just turns\
  \ eyes to the eight year old slowly sinking down in her chair to try to hide under\
  \ the table.  My cousin and her husband helped my uncle clean while my aunt ran\
  \ into the bedroom crying.\n\nNow my parents are hosting Christmas - which translates\
  \ to me doing most of the work.  Neither are at top performance due to health so\
  \ my boyfriend and I will be doing most of the heavy lifting.  In my parents house,\
  \ we may not have crazy expensive antiques, but we do have a small dog, electronics,\
  \ and things of sentimental value.  I told my mom that I don't think Gabby should\
  \ be allowed over.\n\nMy parents think I am overreacting since she is just a kid,\
  \ and this is the first outburst in many months (that we know of most likely). \
  \ Who knows what goes on behind closed doors!  I told my other cousin my concerns....and\
  \ of course it went around full circle and back to me.  Everyone in my family is\
  \ pissed that I want to ban a child from the Christmas holiday, but I don't want\
  \ my dog getting hurt, my parent's or my things getting destroyed - since I do live\
  \ with them.\n\nI am still right now sticking to my guns, but my family is attacking\
  \ me for not being sensitive to children...AITA??\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit:  To answer\
  \ questions from people\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQ: What happens when the parents take over\
  \ disciplining Gabby after we are pushed aside?- Really we don't go into it in front\
  \ of Gabby, but on more than one occasion, ranging from me to my cousin's parents,\
  \ there have been gentle confrontations about letting us be viewed as authorities\
  \ to Gabby.  Maybe we aren't saying the words in the exact way, but the message\
  \ is the same, and that's the key thing here.  But my cousin and her husband get\
  \ bent out of shape about it.  My cousin's husband's family don't acknowledge anything\
  \ is wrong with Gabby and give the girl anything she wants, encouraging the tantrums\
  \ for my side, which is more admittedly strict.  Gabby is not getting the same treatment\
  \ from everyone and it's detrimental to her right now.  We can only say our piece\
  \ and move on at this point.\n\nQ: Why not have my boyfriend's parents watch my\
  \ dog?- I would, but his parents live in Maryland and we are up on Long Island.\
  \  He moved here for his job before we met and his apartment already has a resident\
  \ rabbit who is old and I don't think my dog would take kindly to a rabbit being\
  \ near her.  She may try to attack it thinking it a plush toy - even if she is a\
  \ thirteen pound dog herself.  My mom's side of the family are all doing their own\
  \ things and either have unfriendly dogs or are not dog people.  I tried calling\
  \ the nearby pet hotels and I am on the waitlist for two of them right now.\n\n\
  Q: Can you talk to your cousin about your concerns?- I did.  That's how it got to\
  \ the point of me posting this.  I spoke to her sister first and then my cousin.\
  \  Everyone jumped on the band wagon of saying that I am a horrible person and that\
  \ it's good I don't have kids of my own etc.  Meanwhile I would love to have children\
  \ with my bf when we get married if things continue down that road.  IDK..maybe\
  \ I am just a strict person.I can try again with just my cousin pulled aside in\
  \ a personal phone call or a visit to her house, but a facebook post she put up\
  \ last night makes it clear that she would not be reciprocate me reaching out at\
  \ this current time.\n\nQ: Why not just hide your valuables in a locked room?We\
  \ unfortunately don't have locks on any of the doors inside the house except the\
  \ bathrooms, and those can't be locked for obvious reasons.  There is no basement,\
  \ just an attic that doubles as a playroom for little guests, which is where the\
  \ kids are going to be, so I am more or less screwed.  I can ask my boyfriend to\
  \ house some stuff, but then his already little apartment will be swimming with\
  \ stuff from my parent's house.\n\nPeople saying I can't just uninvite Gabby - I\
  \ know that.  I said my cousin's daughter specifically because she is the problem,\
  \ but of course I mean my cousin's household being told to go to the husband's side\
  \ instead of us or something.  They are refusing to host because, \"We can't have\
  \ all these people at our house.  With Carrie's (another cousin's) daughter also\
  \ here, that's too many kids and something can break.\"  \nYup...pot, meet kettle.\n\
  \n&#x200B;\n\nI appreciate the feedback, and I will update after the Christmas holiday\
  \ if you'd all like to hear about what happens...if anything happens."
