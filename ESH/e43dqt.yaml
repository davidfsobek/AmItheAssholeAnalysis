selftext: "So I\u2019m home for thanksgiving break. Here in the house are me, (19F,)\
  \ my gf, (19F,) my little sister, (10F) my mom, and my brother (21M.) \nMy mom is\
  \ a terrible cook, and also doesn\u2019t really keep food in the house. She left\
  \ to go shopping today, leaving the other four of us at home with only a frozen\
  \ pizza and some really gross leftovers. My gf and my brother decided to make the\
  \ pizza so he put it in the oven and she took it out to let it cool. About 10 minutes\
  \ later, my gf asked my brother to grab her some of the pizza while she was up,\
  \ and he told her it was already gone. \nUpon questioning, we found out that he\
  \ ate the entire pizza by himself as soon as it started to cool, didn\u2019t tell\
  \ anyone, and didn\u2019t even ask us if we wanted any. His excuse is that when\
  \ he first started eating he said out loud \u201CThe pizza is done.\u201D We were\
  \ all playing video games in the next room so idk how we would have heard that anyway.\
  \ \nSo reddit, am I just hangry, or am I the asshole for being upset with him?"
