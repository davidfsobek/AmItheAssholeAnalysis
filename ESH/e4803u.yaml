selftext: "Got a job at the gas station 2 minutes from my house, it was hard to get\
  \ the job (that I don\u2019t have anymore,) because most gas stations don\u2019\
  t hire under 18. \n\nTwo teenagers and their mother came in one evening and were\
  \ picking up stuff. I always watch the cameras when there\u2019s not that many people\
  \ in the store after watching Gas Station Encounters on YouTube and realizing how\
  \ many thieves there are in this world. What do you know, on of the teenagers slips\
  \ a beer in his pants, (it was slim enough not to be noticed,) \n\nWhen they come\
  \ to check out their stuff, I ring them up, and as the mom gets her card out, I\
  \ look at the teenager and say \u201CGive me the beer.\u201D He acts all puzzled\
  \ and I repeat myself, he gives it up and I snatch it and charge them for it. I\
  \ then say \u201CDon\u2019t come back you fucking thief.\u201D \n\nTurns out my\
  \ boss knew those people somehow but he fired me for \u201CProfane language in work\
  \ environment\u201D and \u201CUnprofessionalism\u201D"
