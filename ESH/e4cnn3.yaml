selftext: "Okay so from the title I probably already sound like the asshole but here\
  \ we go. I had my first thanksgiving with my fiances family this year, they're extremely\
  \ wealthy and it was this big fancy event, the food was amazing everything was beautiful,\
  \ but my fiance had to go and ruin it. On the days leading up to thanksgiving he\
  \ was badgering me about how \"well behaved\" I had to be and how I had to make\
  \ a good impression, he bought me this beautiful dress, and booked a hair and makeup\
  \ appointment for me but then some family stuff happened and he switched, he got\
  \ mad at his family and stopped caring. On the day I was still insistent on making\
  \ an effort, but I knew from the get-go he stopped giving a shit when he had already\
  \ down half a bottle of vodka by 10 am. \n\nMost of the day was spent as most thanksgivings\
  \ are spent the family congregating and socialising which is followed by dinner,\
  \ but the whole time, my fiance was being rude and bratty and drunk and stupid.\
  \ He and his sister snuck of a bunch of times (I presume to do drugs) he offered\
  \ me some, when I said no he said: \"Why are you even trying to impress these fuckers?\"\
  \ kinda aggressively and in front of a few of his family members which made me very\
  \ uncomfortable. Anyway, when I realised that at some point my fiance snuck off\
  \ and wasn't planning on coming back I had it, he left me in such an awkward situation\
  \ by myself I didn't want to stick around. I had been texting a friend who I once\
  \ had a thing with about the situation and he said he can send an uber over for\
  \ me and I can spend the rest of thanksgiving with him and his family. I accepted\
  \ the offer and ended up having a fantastic rest of my evening, I spent the night\
  \ there (In the guest bedroom). My fiance didn't even message me once throughout\
  \ the night to check-in.\n\nI returned home and explained to him where I was and\
  \ whatnot (as I don't think I have anything to hide) he simply said, \"of all people\
  \ why'd you go to his house? you also didn't need to spend the night\" my fiance\
  \ is giving me the silent treatment now and sulking about the house, I don't know\
  \ why I specifically chose to spend the night at my ex-love interests but I did."
