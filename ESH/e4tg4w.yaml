selftext: Long story short, my mom (F/46) has been cheating on my stepdad (M/44) for
  about 2 years now however my immediate family has known for about almost a year
  now. She has basically been caught holding photos of her and a man from Mexico by
  my father and when confronted about it she said it was supposedly someone she had
  met before him. She has been caught sending money to this man in Mexico for a whole
  year now as my stepdad has seen receipts and even goes to visit her "aunt" in Mexico,
  coincidentally where this man also lives (her aunt has even told me that she only
  comes over to visit her in Mexico but has been seen disappearing in the night time
  with this man). Basically my whole family knows and my stepdad being her pet has
  done nothing about it. He's been severly depressed for years and despite us nudging
  him to move out and start new, he won't. Because of this, I (F/21)had told my mom
  that once I have children when I'm older that she will not be seeing them (she really
  wants to be a grandma). I had also told her that she may be present at the hospital
  but that she will not see them any other time nor will take no role in raising them
  (she's very verbally+emotionally abusive). She takes it as a joke and despite having
  not told her this in a while, the topic of kids came up again this past Thanksgiving.
  Since I am the only one in my family that is able to have children (other siblings
  hate children and one sibling is infertile) all the focus was on me. My stepdad
  had asked what I planned to do after graduate school and I had said that I planned
  to relax a bit and maybe have kids a couple years after. He then said, "Oh that
  would be great! You could finally make your mom a grandma!" to which she smiled
  at me and me, once meeting her gaze had coldly just stated, "No, she will not be
  seeing my children and she's not going to be a grandma because of what she's doing".
  I had then begun to add that my boyfriend's mother would make an amazing grandma
  and had even emphasized that SHE doesn't do things to hurt her family. Despite this,
  my mom still does not believe that I am serious however, I intend to keep my promises.
  AITA?
