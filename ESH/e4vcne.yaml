selftext: "Trigger warning: Eating disorders \n\nI\u2019ve (20F)  been feeling really\
  \ angry for the past few hours, and I\u2019ll leave you to judge if this anger is\
  \ justified or if I was overreacting. \n\nI haven\u2019t been on amicable terms\
  \ with my uncle\u2019s wife (55F) and we\u2019ve had our personal issues from a\
  \ long time ago, which I will not be elaborating here. I have been tolerating her,\
  \ but what had happened during our Thanksgiving dinner was the breaking point. \n\
  \nI\u2019ve been diagnosed, and struggling with anorexia, and then bulimia for a\
  \ few years. Lately, I\u2019m on recovery and I\u2019m trying my best to recover.\
  \ It is extremely tough for me every single day, and mentally daunting to be able\
  \ to eat without thinking about the calories and not be scared of gaining some weight.\
  \ Anorexia has stayed with me for so many years, it has become a habit though it\u2019\
  s something I wish to ditch. \n\nSo during Thanksgiving dinner, we had dinner at\
  \ my grandparent\u2019s place. Full attendance. All of my relatives went. It was\
  \ all fun and laughter, until my uncle\u2019s wife made a sarcastic statement while\
  \ I was eating a piece of fried chicken. She said, \u2018Good to see you\u2019re\
  \ finally eating some food and recovering. I always knew you\u2019re anorexic. Nobody\
  \ told me. I just knew. It was obvious. That skeletal look, ya know? It\u2019s better\
  \ to be FAT, (I caps locked this word because she lamented it) than to be skeletal,\
  \ honey.\u2019 Nobody heard her statement, because she was beside me and said it\
  \ in her normal tone and the other relatives, my parents included were busily talking\
  \ amongst themselves so her sentence got drowned by the background talking.\n\n\
  I was... enraged beyond words. So I howled at her, \u2018What? Do you think you\u2019\
  re pretty enough to judge me? You\u2019re a flabby chin yourself, please do something\
  \ about yourself first before criticising me!\u2019 I got a little physical with\
  \ her, (no punches, just a little tug) and coupled with the tone, everyone kept\
  \ quiet and it was as if they were all audience for a free show. Awkward silence\
  \ for a few minutes, and then she started to whimper and ran into a room. She has\
  \ been sobbing uncontrollably for a few hours since and was only appeased after\
  \ awhile. \n\nNobody seems to side me, and thinks I\u2019m at fault despite how\
  \ I explained my point of view. I am so confused right now, and I\u2019m starting\
  \ to think I could really be the one at fault. I should\u2019ve swallowed that in,\
  \ is that it? If I did, the dinner wouldn\u2019t have been ruined. But I refuse\
  \ to think I\u2019m at fault. She triggered me first. Not knowing if IATA here,\
  \ I\u2019ve come to seek for some opinions."
