selftext: 'Last Thanksgiving, my husband and I went to his parents'' house. We are
  vegan, and they told us that they''ll have some vegan food for us. So far, so good.


  We went to her house for dinner, and she had a number of vegetable dishes on the
  table to share. MIL told us that they were vegan, so that''s what we had. However,
  at the end of the meal, MIL decided to reveal to us that those dishes were cooked
  in butter. "See? A little bit of butter isn''t that bad, is it? Maybe this will
  teach you to stop being so uptight about that whole vegan thing." she said. Of course
  we were not okay with her lying to us whatsoever, and she decided to tell us that
  we were being "entitled".


  This year, we hosted a vegan Thanksgiving dinner at our house. My husband asked
  me what I thought about inviting MIL over, and whether it was okay with me given
  what happened last year. I thought about it and I had an idea. My MIL absolutely
  hates cucumbers and melons, and will not eat them under any circumstances. She will
  also refuse to eat zucchini, because they apparently look too similar to a cucumber.
  She also refuses to eat cilantro. So I suggested to my husband that we include these
  ingredients in every single thing we cook for the dinner if we are to invite her
  over. He thought about it, and agreed that she deserves it after the stunt she pulled
  last year.


  So for Thanksgiving, we made a number of dishes: a tomato and zucchini casserole;
  a salad that included both cucumber, melon, and cilantro; some green beans and mashed
  potatoes, of course with tons of cilantro. We even added some cucumber and melon
  to our water jug as well. When she came over and saw the meal, she refused to eat
  any of it.


  AITA?'
