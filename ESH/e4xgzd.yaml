selftext: 'I requested time off in April to coincide with my sister''s spring break
  so that she could join my wife and I on a week long trip to Japan. Our flights and
  hotels are already booked and paid for. My sister paid for her own plane fare, but
  I paid for her hotel room. I''ve made reservations for restaurants that range from
  $50 to $400 per person, and I informed my sister over the weekend so that she could
  save up to cover her share.

  This really upset my sister. My sister is currently in graduate school so she is
  only able to work limited hours at her part time job. My wife and I each make six
  figures annually, but my wife will be quitting her job and returning to school in
  January because she is unhappy in her field of work.

  My sister expected me to cover her share, because she''s been freeloading her whole
  life. Over the summer, she joined my wife and I in Hawaii and the only money she
  spent was on her airfare. We''re going on a family vacation with our parents this
  month, and my parents are paying 100 percent of her share.

  My parents say that IATA because my sister doesn''t have a steady income. I feel
  that I''ve been generous enough since I did pay for her to have her own room in
  a five star hotel.

  EDIT: A few people asked how much my sister made. I''m not sure of the exact amount
  but I think it''s around $15 an hour. Also, our parents pay for all of her necessities
  so she should be able to save everything she earns.'
