selftext: So my wife is a stay at home mom with 2 kids under 3yrs. I work from 6am
  to 6pm monday-friday and get home around 630/700. The other day she was complaining
  that I never vacuum/mop/clean the toilets, yadda yadda. Now I do pick up after myself
  and I am not a slob, so I told her that as a stay at home wife, that should be her
  responsibility. I make fairly good money and she is VERY comfortable with her spending.
  I constantly am working on other projects around the house for us too. Am I an asshole
  for expecting her to do most of the cleaning?
