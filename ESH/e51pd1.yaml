selftext: "Throw away account. \nI know I seem like the asshole but here is the background.\n\
  I\u2019m 17, I live with my dad and his wife. \n\nFashion is a hobby I have, I like\
  \ to buy and sell designer clothes. I love to shop for people, I actually make ok\
  \ money doing this as a part time job. \n\nMy dad and stepmom make fun of me for\
  \ it, and call me vain. They don\u2019t think it\u2019s a valuable use of my time,\
  \ but I don\u2019t care. It\u2019s what I like. \n\nDespite making fun of me for\
  \ my hobby, my step mom constantly borrows my clothes. Often times without my permission.\
  \ I have told my dad about this, he says not to be selfish. It\u2019s her house,\
  \ she helps to take care of you. This pisses me off but whatever. \n\nI recently\
  \ saved up a bunch of money and bought a white silk lined Burberry blazer. This\
  \ is a pretty expensive jacket. My step mother borrowed it for what I\u2019m assuming\
  \ is thanksgiving, and put it back in my closet with a huge STAIN on it. Like she\
  \ didn\u2019t even tell me she stained it, and she let the stain SET IN for a day\
  \ or so in my closet. \n\nI went directly to her and said, \u201Cwhat the fuck did\
  \ you do to my coat?\u201D And she LAUGHED and said she spilled a bit of wine on\
  \ it and it was no big deal. I could just have it dry cleaned. \nI asked her if\
  \ she was going to pay for it, she she said NO!!! And even if I get it dry cleaned,\
  \ there might be permanent discoloration in the area of the stain. \n\n\nI demanded\
  \ that she pay for dry cleaning, and if it didn\u2019t work she had to buy me a\
  \ new jacket. And she laughed again, and said \u201Ctough luck\u201D. \n\n\nI fucking\
  \ lost it at her, cursed at her and got grounded by my dad. I plotted and came up\
  \ with the idea to empty some wine in a spray bottle and spray some of her white\
  \ blouses with red wine. I did it. And when she noticed she was furious. She is\
  \ even telling my dad that she wants me to go live with my mom, even though I only\
  \ have one semester of high school left. \n\n\nMy dad wants me to apologize, but\
  \ I\u2019m not going to until she pays for my coat. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m\
  \ in the wrong here, AITA?"
