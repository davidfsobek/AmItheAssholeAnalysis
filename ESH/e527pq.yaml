selftext: "Throwaway account\n\nI had to work until 3 a.m. on Saturday. On Wednesday,\
  \ I asked my coworker if he could drive me home since I don\u2019t usually work\
  \ this late. He didn\u2019t mind and agreed.\n\nThe things is my coworker is definitely\
  \ my type and if I didn\u2019t have a boyfriend, I\u2019d try to date him. However\
  \ I do, so I don\u2019t pursue besides a lil crush. My boyfriend and I have been\
  \ together for 7 years. He knows about my coworker and that I wouldn\u2019t cheat.\
  \ \n\nDuring my shift, around 1 a.m. my boyfriend called me to not ride with my\
  \ coworker. I asked him if he was going to pick me up instead since the other option\
  \ was waiting in the cold for an hour, hoping a bus shows up. Someone got jumped\
  \ a week earlier so I don\u2019t want to stay out longer than I have to. From the\
  \ bus there\u2019s still a 20 minute walk to my house. \n\nHe told me no since he\u2019\
  s hanging out with his friends, but he\u2019s worried. I hung up on him. Once my\
  \ shift was done, my coworker drove me home. We chatted about our manager and movies.\
  \ When he pulled up, he said we should hang out more and kissed me. \n\nI was shocked,\
  \ didn\u2019t say anything and left. I didn\u2019t say anything to my boyfriend,\
  \ but he\u2019s angry I took the ride. I\u2019m now avoiding my coworker.\n\nAITA?"
