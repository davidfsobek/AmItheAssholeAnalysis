selftext: "I'm pretty frustrated now. I am 17M and my sister is 14F. She has a club\
  \ after school and has to be picked up. She texted me, and I was happy to pick her\
  \ up. My parents never asked me to do anything. \n \nOn last Friday, it was raining\
  \ where I lived. I did drive slower, since I'm still learning and didn't want any\
  \ crashes. I came 5 minutes late. When she gets in, she starts shouting at me for\
  \ picking her up late.\n \nToday, I didn't pick her up. I didn't say to her that\
  \ I wasn't picking her up, so she didn't know. She stood out there and my parents\
  \ had to pick her up an hour later. They were furious at me. My parents say that\
  \ I have to be a good brother and \"put up with her complaining\". I will not pick\
  \ her up. She just complains too easily.\n \nSo, AITA?"
