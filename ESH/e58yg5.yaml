selftext: "I\u2019m not telling him not to use one to be spiteful because he doesn\u2019\
  t want me to use a dildo. \nAt the beginning of our relationship we both agreed\
  \ that we\u2019re uncomfortable with each other using sex toys. I don\u2019t like\
  \ the idea of him using a tight plastic vagina replica to get off. He doesn\u2019\
  t like the idea of me having a penis replica to use on myself, especially if it\u2019\
  s larger than him.\nWe agreed and said we wouldn\u2019t use them.\n\nFast forward\
  \ to now and I find a fleshlight hidden away in his closet. I wasn\u2019t snooping,\
  \ we are moving in together and I was helping him pack. \nI confront him and he\
  \ admits that he really likes using one. I tell him that even though I\u2019d love\
  \ to use a dildo during my alone time I don\u2019t because of his feelings.\nI feel\
  \ completely disregarded and disrespected and also upset that he takes so much joy\
  \ in pleasing himself with an object. \nHe said that he sees it being unfair so\
  \ I can now use a dildo if I want. I still don\u2019t want him to use the fleshlight\
  \ though \nI keep having thoughts on if it\u2019s better than my own anatomy.  AITA?"
