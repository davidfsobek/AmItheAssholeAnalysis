selftext: "I\u2019m a teenager. My mom is a blogger/IG influencer. Her online persona\
  \ is \u201Cperfect mom\u201D. I don\u2019t want to say too much about our family\
  \ so we don\u2019t get doxxed but she makes it seem like we are just the happiest\
  \ family ever and love to spend time together doing stuff like baking cookies and\
  \ playing board games\u2014ya know, wholesome stuff. Don\u2019t get me wrong, we\
  \ do enjoy that stuff and I generally like my family but the way she presents it\
  \ online is totally different than how it is. The pictures she shows of us all happily\
  \ baking or cuddled up on the couch are usually just the 2 minutes out of the day\
  \ where we are being the perfect kids she pretends we are.\n\n\nIn reality, we fight\
  \ like normal siblings and sometime get attitude when she makes us do this stuff.\
  \ Most of the time she can convince us to join in so she can take pics for the blog\
  \ then she\u2019ll let us do what we want which is usually play video games, watch\
  \ tv, or hang out with our friends. \n\n\n\nShe makes it seem like we just spend\
  \ all of our time doing wholesome activities.\n\n\n\nSometimes I want to make my\
  \ own counter IG account to post from my POV. Like: here\u2019s my mom sloppily\
  \ decorating cookies with a tripod set up so it looks like my younger siblings did\
  \ it, when in reality they were watching peppa pig the whole time. \n\n\n\nWIBTA\
  \ if I did this? And before you ask, I have talked to my mom about it and we came\
  \ to a compromise that she wouldn\u2019t write about me and my older sibling but\
  \ could still post occasional pictures. She still posts full force about my younger\
  \ siblings. She agreed to this compromise but as time goes on, she starts to share\
  \ more and more and we have to remind her about our agreement. \n\n\nI\u2019ve also\
  \ talked to her about how she posts fake stuff but she says it\u2019s just supposed\
  \ to emulate a certain vibe, not necessarily real life."
