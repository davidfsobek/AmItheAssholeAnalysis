selftext: "I went on a dinner double date with my girlfriend, my girlfriend\u2019\
  s friend Amy, and Amy\u2019s boyfriend. We\u2019re all in our early 20s. My girlfriend\
  \ hangs out with Amy quite often. I see her from time to time, but I\u2019ve never\
  \ cared for her cheeky attitude. The tipping point was tonight. \n\n\nDinner was\
  \ going alright until Amy\u2019s boyfriend innocently commented on how little my\
  \ girlfriend ate. She usually gives me half her entr\xE9e. After that, Amy, who\
  \ isn\u2019t stick thin like my girlfriend, snidely remarked that my girlfriend\
  \ wouldn\u2019t need fake boobs if she ate like a real woman. \n\n\nI loudly told\
  \ her to watch her fat goddamn mouth and that her comment was both rude and unnecessary.\
  \ Amy isn\u2019t overweight by most standards, but that adjective slipped out because\
  \ of what she said prior. Many people turned their eyes toward us. \n\n\nMy girlfriend\
  \ and Amy\u2019s boyfriend tried to quell the ruckus, but Amy got up and told me\
  \ to have fun with my Barbie doll before she motioned Amy\u2019s boyfriend to get\
  \ up and leave with her. Don\u2019t worry, you pay before you get your food at this\
  \ restaurant. \n\n\nMy girlfriend and I talked about Amy. She kept saying that Amy\
  \ and some of her friends make those comments all the time and they don\u2019t mean\
  \ them to be derogatory. I tried to convince my girlfriend that no friend would\
  \ make those types of comments and she\u2019s better off without someone like Amy\
  \ in her life. \n\n\nMy girlfriend still thinks that Amy didn\u2019t mean to hurt\
  \ her with the \u201Creal woman\u201D and \u201CBarbie doll\u201D comments and I\
  \ didn\u2019t read the room correctly. She told me she feared Amy not wanting to\
  \ be friends with her anymore after my creating a rift between them. I couldn\u2019\
  t get though to her no matter how much I tried."

  \ that my girlfriend isn\u2019t a real woman?"
