selftext: "I work at a desk job and we can take breaks to surf the internet/go on\
  \ the net on lunch breaks. My work colleague who sits next to me constantly looks\
  \ at me and my screen. \n\nFor example I booked flights and I needed to keep it\
  \ a secret but couldn\u2019t do it on my phone. So he says \u201Care you booking\
  \ a flight to X are you\u201D. I then had to confirm I was going to the country\
  \ and I didn\u2019t want to elaborate why and with whom. \n\nI try and subtly give\
  \ hints that he\u2019s doing something wrong. Eg today I\u2019m buying a tv and\
  \ he asks if I\u2019m buying a TV. I say \u201CI\u2019ll just looking\u201D. He\
  \ then tries and gets into conversation with me regarding what TV he has. I lock\
  \ my computer screen and walk away.\n\nToday he was looking at me whilst he was\
  \ getting his sandwiches out of his lunch box. So I can see him staring at me so\
  \ I make contact. He thought it was because his sandwiches stunk (he often eats\
  \ smelly tinned fish). He will be on the phone and turn to look at me.\n\nI\u2019\
  ve been sitting next to him for over a year. I feel like saying \u201Cstop looking\
  \ at my screen and stop looking at me\u201D.\n\nMy boss is aware that he annoys\
  \ me, he\u2019s suggested he moves him. There are only six on your team and he can\u2019\
  t really move without it be awkward.\n\nI spent my days working and trying not to\
  \ work. Colleague doesn\u2019t have much work/doesn\u2019t do much. I have made\
  \ it so clear I\u2019m not interested in making small talk.\n\nAlso none of us are\
  \ really supposed to go on the internet in work time, I guess. We also sit next\
  \ to another department and also on the ground floor where colleagues walk past.\
  \ So when he says stuff related to my Computer use it\u2019s saying to the other\
  \ staff members that I\u2019m on the internet during my work time.\n\nAlso I was\
  \ doing some data work which took me like 6 weeks of repetitive info being entered\
  \ into a computer and he actually pulled up his chair to my computer and looked\
  \ at my screen. Bit weird behaviour dont you think? He also got married 10 years\
  \ ago and didn\u2019t tell anyone (considering he told them sex details and about\
  \ his previous wife, all seems a bit weird),\n\nHe was off sick for two months and\
  \ my mood was a lot better because I didn\u2019t have this constant stress to me.\
  \ He annoys me no end. For example I will get into work and walk past everyone saying\
  \ morning and hurry onto my computer. He than asks me \u201Care you ok?\u201D. Like\
  \ ffs, why do I need to talk to you again, stop asking for my attention. I would\
  \ literally love to not talk to anyone."
