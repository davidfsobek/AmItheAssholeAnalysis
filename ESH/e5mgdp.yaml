selftext: "My sister (28) and her husband came home to with my parents and I (21)\
  \ for the holiday. \nHer kids are 8 and 6. \n\na couple of nights before thanksgiving,\
  \ my sister went to a concert with her husband, and left the kids with my parents.\
  \ My parents decided they wanted to go to a dinner party, and they just left in\
  \ the evening and left the kids there with me. \n\nI was not asked to watch the\
  \ kids, I hate kids.  They just told me they were going out and left them in the\
  \ living room. \nMy sisters kids are at an age where they\u2019re loud and hyperactive\
  \ together. You can\u2019t just put a movie on for a time and leave them. \nI\u2019\
  m in my last year of school, and I actually didn\u2019t go hang out with some friends\
  \ so that I could study. \nSo when I noticed this, I just left them alone. \n\n\
  I went to my room to study and locked the door. \n\nI heard a lot of banging, screaming\
  \ and general ruckus, I checked on them to be sure they weren\u2019t injuring themselves,\
  \ but I let them do as they please. I wasn\u2019t asked to watch them.\n\nThey ended\
  \ up causing quite a bit of damage, they broke the TV (I think by throwing stuff\
  \ at it). They got into my moms oil paints and smeared them *everywhere*. Oil paint\
  \ was on the curtains, walls, sofa, rugs, ceiling *everywhere*. They had dog food\
  \ thrown everywhere?? (Luckily the dog himself was with me) water and juice spilled\
  \ everywhere in the kitchen. It was a wreck. Honestly, I laughed. \n\nHowever, get\
  \ this, my mom expects *me* to pay for the damages! She said I was an asshole for\
  \ not just studying down stairs and watching the kids. I WAS NOT ASKED TO WATCH\
  \ THEM. I told her she should ask my sister for the money. They are her kids. \n\
  My whole family has  been fighting about this for several days. Whatever the outcome\
  \ ,  ~~I want to show them this thread to prove that I am not responsible for my\
  \ sisters banshees~~ settle the familial dispute by showing them this thread. \n\
  \nBut on the off chance, AITA?"
