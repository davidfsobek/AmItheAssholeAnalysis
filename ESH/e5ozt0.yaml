selftext: "I work in an office of 16 people. One of my coworkers, Abby, brought in\
  \ chocolate bars that she\u2019s selling for $1 apiece as a fundraiser for her kid\u2019\
  s school. She first approached me and two other coworkers that sit in my desk clump,\
  \ Dave and Jeff. Dave bought a chocolate bar, Jeff did not and told her that it\
  \ was because our boss wouldn\u2019t want her selling them in the office (accurate).\
  \ Abby looked very disheartened when Jeff said that, so I said, \u201CTell you what,\
  \ let me get one for everyone before the boss notices.\u201D I bought 13 chocolate\
  \ bars, one for everyone minus Abby and Dave and our boss (who I\u2019m certain\
  \ would not want one).\n\nDave then started huffing at me because I didn\u2019t\
  \ offer to buy him a second chocolate bar or to reimburse him for the one he had\
  \ just bought. I thought he was joking around about it, but it\u2019s been a few\
  \ hours now and he\u2019s still being snide with me about it. Jeff says that it\u2019\
  s just a dollar and I shouldn\u2019t have excluded him, but I feel like this is\
  \ ridiculous.\n\nIs there some basic principle of etiquette here that I failed to\
  \ observe?  \n\n\ntl;dr: I bought a chocolate bar for everyone in my office except\
  \ a coworker that had just bought his own, and now he's mad at me."
title: AITA for buying a chocolate bar for everyone in my office except the guy that
  had already bought one?
