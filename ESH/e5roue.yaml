selftext: "Hello reddit!\n\nSo, my husband and I have spent the past year having our\
  \ loft space renovated into a gorgeous bedroom suite with Jacuzzi tub, steam shower,\
  \ giant walk-in closet, big screen tv etc etc. it\u2019s basically a duplicate of\
  \ our master bedroom suite and we love it!\n\nMy daughter, 10, has been fighting\
  \ terrible bedtime anxiety for the past year. In an effort to encourage her to sleep\
  \ on her own, we have set up a reward system for her. The reward she chose was to\
  \ sleep in the new suite over the Christmas break. She\u2019s beyond excited and\
  \ making great progress.\n\nHere\u2019s the rub. My brother in law unexpectedly\
  \ lost his job and my husband ended up inviting BIL and SIL to stay for Christmas.\
  \ I managed to keep it from being an open-ended visit because my husband and I are\
  \ both extremely busy. But even for the 2 days that they are visiting, my husband\
  \ expects my daughter to give up her reward so the in-laws can use the new suite.\n\
  \nWe have 4 other bedrooms, and they are all very nicely decorated and spacious.\
  \ I feel like I made a promise to my daughter and my husband is going to break her\
  \ heart. I\u2019ve forbidden him to even mention it at this point, until we get\
  \ this settled. I don\u2019t want her to backslide!\n\nSo\u2026AITA???\n\nEDIT:\
  \ OK some clarification. \n\n1)For those who are asking, my husband was aware that\
  \ we were throwing around the idea of giving my daughter the loft. I don\u2019t\
  \ believe he knew that that was what we had settled on. He says he didn\u2019t know,\
  \ I honestly can\u2019t recall If or what I told him\n\n2) That was of you saying\
  \ I have a vendetta against my in-laws are dead wrong. We don\u2019t mesh, and never\
  \ really have, but that is neither here or there\n\n3) While texting my husband\
  \ and brother-in-law regarding some Christmas details, I accidentally sent brother-in-law\
  \ a text intended for my husband where I discussed the situation. Brother-in-law\
  \ immediately responded that my daughter should have the room. For those of you\
  \ saying I\u2019m just trying to be a bitch to my in-laws, even brother-in-law agrees\
  \ with me"
