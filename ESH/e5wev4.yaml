selftext: "Basically as the title says i(26f) told my mum to stop crying over my drug\
  \ addicted brother(29m). \n\nIt's a new drug addiction, within the last 3 months,\
  \ and our mother has packed up her life and moved 4+ hours away with him to get\
  \ him away from the drugs, all the while he isn't getting any any extra help, no\
  \ rehab, counselling, nothing. \n\nMy mum bought him a car after he wrote his last\
  \ 2 off. Then he came back to where we are from, got on more drugs and wrote the\
  \ new car off, claiming it was stolen, with the keys in it and everything of value\
  \ left inside. \n\nShe constantly cries to me about it and let's it disturb her\
  \ everyday life, I tried having a nice dinner for my son's birthday and someone\
  \ mentioned the brother and she cried, and my son's birthday party someone mentioned\
  \ him and she left with my car leaving me with my ex's family 2 hours from where\
  \ I live. \n\nThat was my last straw, I get it's hard and I'm struggling with it\
  \ too but she can't see how she's being used and abused, so I finally broke and\
  \ told her to stop crying over it and to stop letting it ruin family functions,\
  \ especially my son's birthday that we go to together...\n\nEdit: I have realised\
  \ since posting this that I most definitely sound entitled and selfish! I have decided\
  \ to try to stop taking my frustrations out on my mother and support her through\
  \ this horrible time. Thank you for making me see my stupid ways!"
