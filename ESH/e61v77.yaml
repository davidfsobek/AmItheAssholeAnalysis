selftext: "I'm a student 20, been working at the same place for 4 years now. And some\
  \ girl just got hired like 3 months ago he's she's been bossing everyone around\
  \ for like 2 and a half months and everyone hates her. I was just ignoring her until\
  \ yesterday. With Christmas around the corner there's alot of stuff to do and being\
  \ the only guy working there everyone relies on me for any task that's even a little\
  \ bit physical, like lifting boxes and shit (our store sells furniture btw). Wich\
  \ means that I'm by FAR the busiest employee there. Yesterday was one of the worst\
  \ days at work. I was running around like a headless chicken trying to do my job,\
  \ other peoples job and answer customers the best I could. I get called to the front.\
  \ I drop everything I'm doing and I go there. She's there looking at me. She rolls\
  \ her eyes because apparently I took too long to get there. And DEMANDS of me to\
  \ take a box of plastic bags and put it on the shelf behind the cash register. The\
  \ box is probably around 10 pounds Wich she could have easily lifted herself and\
  \ she does reach the tablet quite easy. At that point I lashed out at her and said\
  \ these exact words :\n\n \" are you fucking serious?, Just to let you know some\
  \ people here are actually fucking working, all you do is run the cash register\
  \ and even that you're garbage at (she makes alot of mistakes). You'll tell us what\
  \ to do the day you can actually do your own job properly.\" \n\nI'm glad there\
  \ was only 2-3 customers around us. Definitely would have been a dick move if there\
  \ were 15 people around. after that my boss had a chat with me about how I can't\
  \ talk like that to other employees like (she was pretty chill cause she likes me\
  \ alot) ."
