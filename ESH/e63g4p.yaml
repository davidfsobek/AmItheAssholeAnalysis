selftext: "I've been with my fiancee for 8 years, we were each other's firsts for\
  \ everything and have never dated other people. We always knew were going to get\
  \ married and last year I proposed and the wedding was sent for January 2020. I've\
  \ never been happier and whilst she wanted a big glitzy wedding I managed to convince\
  \ her to have a small affair in Scandinavia with family and close friends, then\
  \ the money we saved can either go to a house deposit or our honeymoon.\n\nWe were\
  \ having a talk this weekend and she wanted us to get all our secrets and issues\
  \ out of the way so we could start the new decade and marriage with a clean slate.\
  \ I found this odd but decided to do it anyway as I didn't have much to confess.\
  \ \n\nWhen we were at university we had a period of about a month where we weren't\
  \ speaking, we had a massive argument and whilst I remember clearly that we hadn't\
  \ broken up or \"go on a break\" we weren't speaking to each other. The argument\
  \ started because she was getting close to some guy and she wanted to open our relationship.\
  \ I was totally against it and she finally agreed with me but wouldn't speak to\
  \ me.\n\nShe confessed to me that during this 2 month period she went ahead with\
  \ it anyway and in her words \"It was a mistake and made me realise how much I loved\
  \ you\". I could understand if it had been one night, but for 2 months? No.\n\n\
  I didn't know what to say so I just said \"It's all in the past\" and pretended\
  \ everything was ok, but in reality I am very upset that she lied and hid this for\
  \ too long and I have lost all love for her and any interest in marrying her. \n\
  \nAITA if I tell my parents what happened and then just ghost her and our friends?\
  \ I don't want to deal with her trying to convince me to stay, I just want to walks\
  \ away from it all."
