selftext: "Edited: the question about vet fees not whose at fault for fight. \nSo\
  \ about a week ago a new dog came to our off lead dog park, My ginormous dopey rescue\
  \ was over zealous in her greeting, new dog didn\u2019t like like it/her, snapped\
  \ at her face, my dog retaliated and a 15 second fight ensued. My dog had a few\
  \ scrapes but other dog had 2 punctures in her back. I broke the fight up, gave\
  \ my dog to my hubby to hold and went back to assist with the older lady walking\
  \ the other dog. I apologised profusely as my dog was the one to approach and she\
  \ had injured the other dog which was an older collie type. I apologised profusely\
  \ again and told the lady we would cover the vet bills and that she needed to get\
  \ her dog seen to ASAP as bites get infected really fast. I offered to drive her\
  \ to the nearby 24hr emergency vet then or help her get the dog to a vet the following\
  \ day. She said \u201CI\u2019ll see how she is in the morning\u201D I said you really\
  \ should go today or tomorrow due to infection risk, reassured we\u2019d pay for\
  \ it, and to call me when she was at the vet so we could pay over the phone. She\
  \ agreed, she gave us her number so we left a message on her machine with our contact\
  \ details ect.\n\nWe didn\u2019t hear anything the next day, so left another message\
  \ to follow up and offer assistance again, still heard nothing. \n\nFast forward\
  \ to today, 8 days after incident, lady\u2019s husband called to say that they took\
  \ the dog to the vet TODAY as her wounds were really infected, Dog required surgery\
  \ to clean out infected wounds as well as a heap of antibiotics. Cost of vet bills\
  \ now in the thousands, all because owner left it for a week and allowed a raging\
  \ infection to set on rather than seeking help after the incident to prevent this\
  \ situation. I\u2019ve told the owner that we will pay for half which is way more\
  \ than it would have cost for early intervention but he\u2019s furious and saying\
  \ we have to pay it all because our dog did the initial damage to which i agreed\
  \ that yes she did bite, but it\u2019s not our fault the animal was left untreated\
  \ for over a week and got really sick and that we tried in every way to help but\
  \ heard nothing back \nShould i pay the whole bill? I know our dog and we took responsible\
  \ action as our was at fault but I feel as though we shouldn\u2019t have to be out\
  \ of pocket for them neglecting to seek vet care for their dog in an acceptable\
  \ time frame. \nNote: our dog is now on lead all the time now and we\u2019ve got\
  \ her a silicons muzzle for when she\u2019s out around other dogs"
title: WIBTA if I only pay half a huge vet bill after a dog fight because owners waited
  a week to get their dog vet treatment resulting in massive infection?
