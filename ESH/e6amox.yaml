selftext: "Yeah, it's a dick move, but I want to know if it's actually \"wrong\".\
  \  \n\nI really don't care much for litterbugs.  I head our village's litter cleanup\
  \ initiative where we get various groups to volunteer for an hour or two cleaning\
  \ the park, train station, etc.  Ours is a nice little town and we like to keep\
  \ it that way.\n\nPeople have a nasty habit of throwing their cigarette butts out\
  \ of the windows of their cars.  If given the opportunity, I immediately pick the\
  \ butt up and huck it back into the car.  This typically has the expected result.\n\
  \nThe chief of police tells me that while he thinks it's hilarious, it could cause\
  \ an accident and it's poor judgement to do so.  And he's probably right.  But damn\
  \ it all, I just hate the blatant rudeness.  \n\nI do this with other trash as well.\
  \  So.. I probably know the answer to this, but I'm curious to see if anyone thinks\
  \ I'm NOT the asshole. \n\nThanks for weighing in."
