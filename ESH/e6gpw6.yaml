selftext: "So I play a game called Squash, it's kind of like the StarCraft Brood War\
  \ of racket games - popular as hell 30 years ago but definitely obsolete now. Anyway,\
  \ several of the players from my small hometown have been travelling to the next\
  \ town over to perform a round robin tournament for almost a decade. Until now,\
  \ I've been carpooling with them but didn't get my own car until very recently.\n\
  \n  \n\n\nEach of the players takes a turn to drive, and now that I've had my own\
  \ car for a few weeks, I've had a couple of turns myself. Now, the music these guys\
  \ play is golden oldies radio hits, which I'm sick to fucking death of listening\
  \ to. Anything from the 80s, Neil diamond, David bowtie, ACDC, just the same CD\
  \ ON repeat for the 6 months I've been carpooling with them. It brings back memories\
  \ from when they were my age, and while good songs obviously repetition has ruined\
  \ them.\n\n  \n\n\nSo I got my scrawny little 4 door (Edit) Barina, a tight fit\
  \ but cheap for what it is, and when I drive, I'm playing whatever is on my Spotify\
  \ via Bluetooth. You can see where this is going. Agalloch, Opeth, Gojira, Rammstein,\
  \ phutureprimitive, Soulacybin. I have to say it's been amazing to have music that\
  \ I'm into actually playing in a car, and it's so good that I don't want to give\
  \ it up, despite the complaints - from the same guy who never played anything other\
  \ than his greatest 80s hits.\n\n  \n\n\nSo I said to him - quite bluntly - that\
  \ he's had his queen, his deep purple etc, and I've never said a word to him, so\
  \ i ask that when he's in my car that he extend me the same courtesy. Mind you there's\
  \ usually 4 or 5 of us carpooling in this hour long trips each way, and 3 of us\
  \ are on rotate now, so it's either contemporary radio top 100s (which nobody minds)\
  \ or 80s hits ( which I'm sick of but I choose not to say anything before now because\
  \ I pick my battles) or my spotify (which 80s guy can't stand but the other guys\
  \ are kinda not into it sorta maybe.) \n\n  \n\n\nAnd while I've been carpooling\
  \ with these other guys for a long time and it is my turn to contribute now that\
  \ I have a car, I feel like this expectation to compromise my tastes in music for\
  \ theirs is not reciprocated and therefore unjustified. I asked them if they would\
  \ rather they have my music or no music at all, and when they said no music at all\
  \ then i asked if the same could be applied to those 80s CDs too, at which point\
  \ they said that because the driver cant drink after a game then the music is what\
  \ keeps them buzzed, which of course is exactly true when I'm driving, and they\
  \ said \"Nobody likes that screamo shit mate.\" Which i accept, but my hangup is\
  \ that theyre not willing to give up their music for me to keep their drivers awake,\
  \ so i should not give up mine for the same reason. Here we are at an impasse. \n\
  \n  \n\n\nAm I the asshole?"
