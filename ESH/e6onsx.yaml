selftext: "I (F21) suffer from depression and anxiety; so does my stepmother (F45ish)\
  \  One of my problems when I'm super depressed is I don't clean my room. There will\
  \ be a lot of take out bags and stuff like that on the floor and it gets difficult\
  \ to even walk on the room. I know this is a problem and when I got bad I spoke\
  \ to my father about it and he knows that I just need someone to tell me to clean\
  \ and I will. I struggle doing it on my own because I'm so unmotivated and then\
  \ when I have the energy to I'm so anxious about being seen with the garbage because\
  \ I know it's terrible that I hide away in my room. Over the last few months I've\
  \ gotten better and I set times for me to clean after work.\n\nAnyway, I got home\
  \ from work ready to clean my room because it had gotten bad again and I come home\
  \ to all of the garbage piled up on my bed. I was furious and when I asked my dad\
  \ he had no idea it happened so I knew my step mother was the one who put it there.\
  \ I am very careful with my garbage because I don't want any mold or bugs so it's\
  \ always \"clean\" garbage (no real food stuff that can go bad) but I had a small\
  \ bowl of soup from the night before that I was going to throw out and it spilt\
  \ all over my bed. My sheets and everything needed to be cleaned and my mattress\
  \ is ruined and I need a new one but can't afford it. \n\nI texted my stepmother\
  \ and told her it was disrespectful to go in my room when I'm not there and that\
  \ she should have just texted me instead of throwing the garbage on my bed. She\
  \ told me she'd treat me like an adult when I started acting like one. \n\nSince\
  \ then we have not spoken and it has been a week. I refuse to talk to her or even\
  \ really look at her. I know I have a problem but I am managing it. She suffered\
  \ from the same problems but had never taken me seriously or seemed to respect me.\
  \ I originally felt like I was in the right but as time goes on I hear her talking\
  \ to my dad about having a \"discussion\" with me since I no longer eat with him\
  \ when she's home and I'm starting to wonder if I am in the wrong. \n\nTLDR: My\
  \ stepmother and I both suffer from depression and anxiety but I don't feel like\
  \ she understands me. Am I in the wrong for not talking to her after she put my\
  \ garage on my bed? Am I the one being unreasonable?\n\nEdit: It is not my stepmother's\
  \ home it is my father's and my childhood home. She lives there part time and spends\
  \ that other half with her boyfriend (my parents are polyamorous)\n\nI have had\
  \ depression since I was around 10 and anxiety since about 15. I'm currently on\
  \ a waiting list for a therapist and can't afford my medication at the moment. My\
  \ family didn't know I had been hospitalized a few times until about 6 months ago."

  my trash on my bed?
