selftext: "Long story short, we have children together. A 2 yo, and a 9month old.\
  \ She left at like 9-10pm to \u201Cgo to the store\u201D supposedly for wrapping\
  \ paper and formula for our baby. And I\u2019m tired of her going out constantly\
  \ and staying out till whoever knows when, then coming home and sleeping in and\
  \ complains that she\u2019s tired. So, finally I just posted on her wall for all\
  \ to see \u201Chey you remember we have children right? A little more important\
  \ than hanging out with your friends all night.\u201D"
