selftext: "OK. I don't know. I'm trying to tell myself that I'm not. But now I have\
  \ my doubts and a lump in my throat. Here's the story.\n\nFYI I'm 23.\n\nMy brother\
  \ got married and I have somewhere in the region of \xA38000 of my savings to my\
  \ parents to help them pay off the wedding. My younger sister gave \xA36000. I saved,\
  \ knowing that my parents wouldn't be able to pay. I live rent-free, they buy the\
  \ majority of the food.\n\nMy dad lost his job earlier this year and used money\
  \ that guests gave to my brother and his wife to pay the bills. My mom works as\
  \ well and used her money to buy gifts and things for the extended family.\n\nAt\
  \ some point, neither my mom or dad had much money for bills so I have them another\
  \ \xA3600 that I had not really budgeted for.\n\nI'm going Dubai... But my savings\
  \ have dropped with other expenses (clothes, home food, new pairs of glasses, going\
  \ out etc) and it's stressing me out.\n\nI've asked for \xA3200 back but I think\
  \ that's a lot for my parents and I feel like an asshole for asking for it even\
  \ though I do have a savings... It's just shrinking, not growing. And my parents\
  \ have almost nothing.\n\nThe other piece of context is that my dad has literally\
  \ never saved, though he has had plenty of opportunities. He spends his money on\
  \ cars mostly.\n\nBut that's not really important.\n\nAm I the asshole for asking\
  \ for my money back from my parents who don't have a lot...\n\nEdits:\n\n1. For\
  \ INFO: So basically my dad checked his account. His money was low. We had a lot\
  \ left from the wedding. I had told him to put money in it. He said payments were\
  \ due to go the next day and he wouldn't have time to deposit the money. He said\
  \ he'd pay it me back right away when he deposited the money. Obviously he didn't\
  \ give it back.\n\n2. For background. I'm Asian. My parents don't want me to leave\
  \ until I'm married. They don't want to accept rent, I've tried. Due to the above,\
  \ I gave the money under the assumption I would get it back the next day. It was\
  \ for bills... That my dad kinda raised himself by spending too much. But that doesn't\
  \ change the fact he didn't have a job for a while.\n\n3. My type of Asian is stupid.\
  \ Stupid Asians. The whole \"put on a show\" thing is more important to us than\
  \ our own wellbeing. My parents promised my brother they'd have the money for his\
  \ wedding. He was also supposed to put a lot in but he didn't save much (hotels,\
  \ food, wedding makeup for his fianc\xE9 and her wedding dress, honeymoon). So my\
  \ parents told him to not put a penny in and for my sister and I to pay it, saying\
  \ they'll pay us back.\n\nI mean I knew, and my sister knew, we weren't seeing the\
  \ thousands back. I'm fine with that. But that awkward \xA3600 is like a spike.\n\
  \nBut I realise I'm an asshole anyway when I say I'll pay rent and yet I'm asking\
  \ for money back that I could've given if I paid rent. I think it's the whole thing\
  \ about how they won't take money from us, but do, that makes me confused.\n\nEssentially,\
  \ I hate my life."
