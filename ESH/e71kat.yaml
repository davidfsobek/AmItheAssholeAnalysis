selftext: "Backstory:  my bf and I live together bc we have a child together (under\
  \ 2) and for the time being it\u2019s easier.  We are not in a good place, but trying\
  \ to work things out.  \n\nMy bf was scheduled for minor surgery, and I agreed to\
  \ take him in and pick him up.  All in all, it apppeared the total time in the surgery\
  \ facility would be about 3 hours.  He knew nothing about the details, other than\
  \ generally what they were doing and where/when he had to be there.  Knew nothing\
  \ about after-care, medication, etc.  \nWe arrive at the surgery center, and I stay\
  \ with him to fill out his paperwork, and while he waits for them to call him back.\
  \  Seconds before he is called back, I see a sign that says that surgery patients\
  \ must have someone in the waiting room.  I ask him about this, and he mumbles something\
  \ and basically plays dumb.  The nurse walks out to call him back and he just stands\
  \ there so I have to literally tell him to ask her what the situation is.  She says,\
  \ yes, someone has to be here the whole time.  That was not what was communicated\
  \ to me, nor what I agreed to.  \nI should note, I had surgery myself a little over\
  \ a week ago, much more invasive than what he is having.  I hadn\u2019t bathed for\
  \ 2 days, I hadn\u2019t eaten anything, and I had taken (mild) pain medication that\
  \ morning, as I am still swollen and in a good amount of pain myself.  I was NOT\
  \ planning on sitting in an uncomfortable waiting room for 3 hours.  \nI waited\
  \ for about 15 minutes in the waiting room, and then got a phone call.  I stepped\
  \ outside to take the phone call and decided to leave at that point.  \nI was irritated\
  \ that he is consistently acting like an irresponsible child.  I was irritated that\
  \ he seemingly either didn\u2019t find out or wasn\u2019t forthcoming about the\
  \ surgery center\u2019s requirement.  \nI should note that we live 10 minutes from\
  \ the surgery center.  We are not married, so I can\u2019t make medical decisions\
  \ for him, so I\u2019m not sure what purpose it is that I need to stay there.  \n\
  I didn\u2019t leave to go do anything fun, I left bc we are 10 minutes away, I am\
  \ also recovering, and wanted to do so in my own home.  \nI also am on short term\
  \ disability from work.  There is a chance, albeit probably remote, that I could\
  \ also be penalized for being somewhere for 3 hours that\u2019s not my home or my\
  \ doctors office.  I\u2019m annoyed that he put me in that position without telling\
  \ me first.  \nA few other notes may or may not be relevant:  \nHe is on my insurance\
  \ but will be paying for this himself.  \nWhen I went in for my surgery, my mom\
  \ took me and picked me up, not him.  She was not required to wait, just to be there\
  \ when they were done.  (Mine was a total of 6 hours).  This was pre-planned, my\
  \ mom came in from out of state so that my bf could watch our son (after full day\
  \ daycare) on surgery day, and so that my bf would have the extra help while I recover.\
  \  \n\nI do worry about him and feel bad that I left.  But I am mad that he didn\u2019\
  t bother to find out or specifically omitted the details.  AITA?"
