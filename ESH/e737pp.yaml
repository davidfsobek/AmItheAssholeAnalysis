selftext: "I'll cut down to the crux of the story - \n\nHusband is having an affair,\
  \ I found out in March, grieved the relationship on my own, moved on a few months\
  \ later. I'm now dating a wonderful guy (we are yet to be intimate though) and was\
  \ waiting for evidence to file for divorce and tell his affair partner's (AP) husband.\
  \ \n\nTurns out AP's husband already suspected something was wrong. A week ago,\
  \ he contacted me and talked to me about the unnecessary closeness between my husband\
  \ and his wife. Turns out, he found an email on her phone about STD screening. Looked\
  \ through it, deleted the email and got her reports from the clinic. He thought\
  \ it was a mistake, so he went ahead and got himself tested. He was in the clear.\
  \ That convinced him the results were wrong after all, but he still wanted my reassurance\
  \ to know nothing inappropriate was happening between his wife and my husband.\n\
  \n I had to break the bad news. He was understandably devastated and agreed to cooperate\
  \ with me by splitting the cost of PI. \n\nThe PI agency tracked down my husband\
  \ to a relatively unknown hotel wednesday night, they saw him coming out of the\
  \ hotel with his AP and they were being affectionate with each other, at one point\
  \ they kissed each other deeply. \n\nWe got what we needed and I'm now serving him\
  \ divorce papers on Christmas morning (his favorite holiday). \n\nToday morning\
  \ at 4 am, I overheard my husband making a reservation at the same hotel for this\
  \ sunday. \n\nSo I know they are still having sex. I know his mistress has an STD,\
  \ and I know him having sex with her can potentially expose him to the STD. \n\n\
  Is it my obligation to tell him? AITA for not letting him know?\n\n\nEdited : \n\
  \n\nTo add some context, Husband and I have a 4 year old . His mistress has a baby,\
  \ which quite possibly isn't her husband's. He doubts the paternity because the\
  \ child looks mixed race.\n\nAND, he doesn't know that I know about his affair.\n\
  \n\nedit 2 - I chose Christmas because me and my daughter are spending christmas\
  \ with my family, and won't return until 2nd January. Husband was flaky about going,\
  \ so I might as well serve the papers that morning and get done with it. I've already\
  \ met my attorney.\n\nedit 3 - ours will be a no fault divorce, no mention of his\
  \ infidelity will be used in the court. The evidence is for my safety.\n\n\n[ some\
  \ people are confused about the timeline of my pregnancy -\n\n\nI found out I was\
  \ pregnant in late October. I was already ~11 weeks along. Didn't get symptoms almost\
  \ all throughout my first trimester, by the time I started feeling different, I\
  \ was already ~3 months pregnant. Husband was out of town, yet again. Got an abortion.\
  \ \n\n\nHopefully it will clear up the confusion about the timeline. And yes, it\
  \ was the only time we had sex after I found out about his cheating - the night\
  \ of my daughter's birthday. He kind of coerced me into It that night. I couldn't\
  \ say no and cried myself to sleep afterwards. ]\n\n\n------"
