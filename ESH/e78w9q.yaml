selftext: "My FedEx package is late. I mentioned that I was doing to try to get my\
  \ money back for the expedited delivery I paid for, since it's not very expedited.\
  \ My boyfriend reminded me that whoever I speak to isn't responsible for my package\
  \ being late, and that I should be nice. I told him not to worry, because while\
  \ I might be a white woman, I am about 20 years too young to be *that* person. I\
  \ joked about the conversation with my dad, and he blew up. \n\nStarted saying that\
  \ I'm a virtue signaller, self-hating, fake woke, etc. He then started dropping\
  \ every racial slur he could think of, including the n word with a hard r, and saying\
  \ that Karen, which I never actually mentioned, was equal. I just walked away, which\
  \ was great until he followed me to continue ranting about it. Saying that I'm contributing\
  \ to the oppression and replacement of the white race, I'm only dating my (Asian)\
  \ boyfriend out of white guilt, etc. And he made up fake Asian words to say that\
  \ as offensive his slurs, comments about eating my dogs, and the like we're to me,\
  \ my comments on middle aged white women were to him. \n\nI don't think my comments\
  \ crossed any lines. I think I was making fun of myself as much as I was anyone\
  \ else, and that what he did was borderline unforgivable. However, the sheer magnitude\
  \ of his reaction is making me wonder if I'm somehow crazy, if I'm really a bad\
  \ person, if this is all in my head. Am I actually the asshole here?"
