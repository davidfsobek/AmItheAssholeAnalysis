selftext: My girlfriend is Latina and will other date other Latinos. She especially
  find Asians unattractive.  My name is Spanish, I speak Spanish and look Latino and
  grew up in Hispanic neighborhood so I easily pass. However, I am Filipino and told
  my gf that I am Mexican. I told her that I was adopted by an Asian family to explain
  why my parents look Asian. She told me the other night that she loved me for the
  first time. I feel awful lying to someone I love so much.
