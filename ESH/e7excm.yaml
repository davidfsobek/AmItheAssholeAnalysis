selftext: 'So I work in retail, and since the holiday season is here, I usually says
  "Happy Holidays!" to the customers after I check them out. This has cause some "nice"
  old ladies to correct me and say "Merry Christmas to you too!" or just flat out
  say "you''re supposed to say Merry Christmas."


  The area that I live in is not very diverse when it comes to religion, so I see
  how they''re used to the Merry Christmas, but I''m an atheist (who half celebrates
  Christmas) and I want to wish all people happy holidays.


  Since I''m very petty, whenever a customer corrects me or says Merry Christmas back,
  I say "oh sorry I''m Jewish." This causes them to stop for a second, and sometimes
  they say "Happy Hanukkah" and other times they say "oh Happy Holidays then!"


  More recently I realized this may be a assholey thing to do, since I''m not Jewish
  and I probably shouldn''t be saying I am just so that the customers say Happy Holidays...
  but I guess my reasoning is it makes them think about the fact that not everyone
  celebrates Christmas and Happy Holidays is more universal. But still I could just
  be an asshole.


  So AITA?'
