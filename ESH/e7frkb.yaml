selftext: "This is tough because there is so much history and I want to be brief.\
  \ I've been married for 14 years and when we met her daughter was 5 father out of\
  \ the picture. After less than a year my wife and I got married because she was\
  \ laid off from her job and I wanted to provide insurance to them. Anyway, we've\
  \ been together ever since had two kids of our own. I always tried to make extra\
  \ effort with my SD to make sure she felt part of the family. Her deadbeat dad came\
  \ back and she started treating me like crap. Not the super important stuff but\
  \ just a little context.\_\_\n\nFast forward to present day. She's now 19. After\
  \ graduating high school she took a year off and did nothing. I didn't approve since\
  \ I support everyone and am the only one who works full time. She worked part time\
  \ at a bakery and doesn't have her license even though my wife has taken her 5 times\
  \ to DMV. Anyway she is now in community college and my wife drives her to and from\
  \ work and school. She's only asked a few things, don't eat in her room (a constant\
  \ problem because she leaves chocolate and food all over and doesn't clean up),\
  \ take out the garbage and very occasionally walk the dog that she promised she\
  \ would so we can get a dog.\_\n\nShe constantly eats in her room, smokes pot in\
  \ her room, and literally always going through my things when I'm not home. I've\
  \ asked my wife multiple times to stop driving her until she gets her shit together\
  \ and leanrs to respect us because I feel it's the only way to get her to be respectful\
  \ and appreciate what she has.\n\nFinally after months my wife was fed up with her\
  \ and told me she won't drive her anymore. The next day she drives her to school.\
  \ Her school is 30 minutes away so one hour round trip. I say where are you going.\
  \ Oh she told me she wont eat in her room anymore. I said that's not what we agreed\
  \ to she did it anyway.\_ A week goes by she still drives her everywhere and after\
  \ she leaves I find McDonald's and cookies everywhere. I get told oh she's sorry\
  \ she was rushing it was her breakfast. First it was food from the night before.\
  \ I lost it and said that's such a lie. I get told I'm an ahole and to leave and\
  \ that my wife hates me because I would not let my SD apologize. I said I don't\
  \ want to hear I was in a rush. That's an excuse. She was in the bathroom putting\
  \ on makeup for an hour\n\n\nSome time goes by, she continues eating in her room.\
  \ Again, I'm told I'm really not driving her anymore. So today I go for a walk come\
  \ back and my wife's gone. I go in her room and find things that belong to me in\
  \ a bag with food and other things that shouldn't be here. I call my wife and am\
  \ told she had an exam and couldn't get an Uber on time. I said well if she had\
  \ an exam why was she sleeping twenty minutes ago. Oh she paid me to drive her.\
  \ I tried remaining calm and get hung up on. I show my wife the things she took\
  \ and was told oh that's so old. Does that matter?\_ She went in my things and took\
  \ stuff that doesn't belong to her.\_"
