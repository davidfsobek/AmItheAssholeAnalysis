selftext: "Background: my best friend who I love and adore very much was absolutely\
  \ oblivious to her bf being in love with her for YEARS. He is a great dude, quiet\
  \ and shy but all around awesome and has become a close friend of mine. \nWell,\
  \ she finally opened her eyes after her previous BF dumped her because she said\
  \ she was done going to see him and that he\u2019d need to come see her (THANK GOD).\
  \ \nBestie and bf have been together for about three months now, and it\u2019s honestly\
  \ cute as fuck. I gave bf a list of everything she wanted out of a relationship\
  \ and he\u2019s doing everything in his power to give her what she wants. The list\
  \ was mostly shit like \u2018talk on the phone everyday\u2019 and \u2018respect\
  \ my bubble when I need it\u2019 and \u2018spend time together whenever possible\u2019\
  . \nWell, fast forward to last night. \nBestie and bf go out to a nice restaurant\
  \ and see a movie, both are dressed really nice. Bestie is in a cute black dress\
  \ and bf has a button down and nice boots on, they look cute af together. \nAfter\
  \ this they go to a bar and bf gets bestie a drink, he doesn\u2019t drink, and bestie\
  \ starts texting me about their night. \nWe\u2019re just shooting the shit and he\
  \ brings her a drink that she sends me a picture of and I tell her that looks bomb\
  \ af. She then asks me if I wanna come get one with her. \nI asked if they were\
  \ ok with me crashing the end of their date night, and she just said \u2018sure\
  \ come on, I need bestie time too!\u2019 She was really enthusiastic about me coming\
  \ and getting a drink with them. \nSo I head on over, and bf is being bf, just happy\
  \ to sit there and hold her hand and listen. He\u2019s a quiet and reserved dude,\
  \ normally. To everyone but her, and me, sometimes, if I catch him in a certain\
  \ mood. \nWell, over the next hour and after a drink from the bar, the mood gradually\
  \ changed. Of course, my best friend has tequila and rum running through her, she\u2019\
  s oblivious. I just had a sangria and could feel the vibe bf was giving me. \nHe\
  \ wouldn\u2019t outright say it because he\u2019s too nice, but the vibe he was\
  \ saying said \u2018fuck off OP\u2019. \nI feel like an asshole because apparently\
  \ they had both been having really in-depth convos before I came and then he just\
  \ went silent. \nSo, tell me, am I the Asshole for accepting an invite to go get\
  \ a drink with my bestie and her bf on their date night? I feel like I am, but I\u2019\
  m also known to overthink a lot so gimme some opinions."
