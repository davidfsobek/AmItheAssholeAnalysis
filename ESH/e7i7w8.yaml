selftext: 'I''ve been living in a dorm for six months, and I am a music major, so
  I have to practice and write music as much as possible. I am in a single dorm, so
  I have no roommates; however, my neighbour clearly has a vendetta against me. Any
  time I play an instrument, he bangs on my walls, regardless of how quiet I''m trying
  to play. He has never made an attempt to come over and talk to me in person, instead,
  he''s filed numerous noise complaints and even left a note on my door. Now it''s
  at the point where my RA sent an email to me telling me I have to stop. I have speakers
  in my dorm that I''ve never once used for playing music for fear of pissing off
  my neighbour who I''m now walking around on eggshells for.


  Now here''s the kicker. He is also a music major. Music theatre. So I am hearing
  him all of the time singing at the top of his lungs with no care in the world. He
  sings in the shower. He does vocals warm ups in his room sometimes. Now I wouldn''t
  have a problem with this if it wasn''t such a double standard. Ideally, if we could
  both just mind our own business and be able to practice in our own rooms, it would
  be great. I''ve never filed a noise complaint on him, but he persists.


  Am I the asshole?


  Edit: Forgot an important piece. There are practice rooms located in the basement
  of my building. There are two of them, and must be reserved. They close after 10,
  and sometimes are booked, since there''s only three of them. Also, there''s no noise
  cancellation, so if anyone else is in the other room, practicing acting or a dance
  routine with a loud speaker, I will hear everything, making it impossible for me
  to focus. In the email from the RA, I was told that I am not allowed to play music
  in my dorm anymore and must use the practice rooms.'
