selftext: 'I''m 31 years old and due to unfortunate circumstances (death), I ended
  up living with my parents again at age 29. Well, today, my mother began yelling
  at me because when I was in the shower, the doorbell rang and nobody could go get
  the door. She tried to call me out for not getting the door, so I reminded her that
  I was in the bathroom and then I said that actually, she should be ashamed of herself
  for being too lazy to even be capable of opening the door.

  This escalated quite quickly, because then my father got involved since she complained
  (without sharing that I was in the shower) that I did not get the door. I then pointed
  out all of the ways my mother isn''t yet an adult: she doesn''t manage her own bank
  account (spent $5000 last month and tried to get my father to file a claim for lost
  funds even though the statements made it clear she went shopping), she makes my
  father get all her meds and call in refills for her, she does not go to the doctor
  by herself, she can not drive because that''s her husband''s job, she never gets
  the door even though it is often for her, she does not know how to change the input
  on the television, she makes my father call people when she wants to talk to them
  since she doesn''t want to seem like she is reaching out. I pointed out to my father
  that it is his fault that she never became an adult -- she moved from her parents''
  house to my dad''s house at 21 and never really became independent. To this day,
  he pays for everything and despite her having a job, she does not spend a cent or
  lift a finger around the house.

  AITA for finally calling her out?? Both she and my dad seem to think I was in the
  wrong for pointing this all out but something''s gotta give.'
