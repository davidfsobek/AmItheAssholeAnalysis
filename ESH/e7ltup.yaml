selftext: "My office does an angel tree through a local social services agency. So\
  \ you don\u2019t get to pick based on WHAT the kid wants. You email the SW and ask\
  \ for a kid. I said to give me a boy my son\u2019s age (8). \n\nShe wrote back and\
  \ explained each kid gets an outfit and 3 gifts. 2 of the gifts are $20/30... one\
  \ is $60 (some space age game controller). The SW was all happy, that kid is one\
  \ of 6 now that his mom just had twins. \n\nMe, I\u2019m trying to get my husband\
  \ to agree to a third  child when we both make 6 figures. Also when I was in the\
  \ hospital (surgeries and broken bones) being hit by a drunk driver a few years\
  \ ago, people weren\u2019t buying my kids Christmas gifts, they were screaming at\
  \ me to get my lazy ass back to work, stop being selfish, and provide for my children.\
  \ \n\nThere\u2019s showing others the empathy you wish you had been shown  and there\u2019\
  s being taken advantage of. \n\nETA: in my case part of the reason people were so\
  \ awful to me & my fam was one day I volunteered a lot (on the ground and as a board\
  \ member of a nonprofit) and was a lot of things to a lot of people. Then BAM! Drunk\
  \ driver hits me and I had to stop suddenly. I learned that people didn\u2019t appreciate\
  \ what I did; they felt entitled and when I had to pause for two seconds I was demonized.\
  \ I\u2019d never  want someone to feel as discarded as I did; but I never want someone\
  \ to feel entitled to my help again either. \n\n One of my girlfriends (has a similar\
  \ angel tree dilemma; this agency needs to reflect;\nThey\u2019re pissing off a\
  \ lot of people in town this year) was at my house today while  my husband was fixing\
  \ the considerably older controller that goes to our considerably older gaming consul.\
  \  \n\nThe kid that she was given, requested an actual video game system, and instead\
  \ she got him a game stop card. They also have two children and their income is\
  \ probably about the same as ours. \n\nMy friend and I were discussing are we potentially\
  \ being generous  or just enabling by fulfilling all these requests. \n\nMy husband\
  \ and I also angel tree\u2019d a schoolmate Of our kids\u2019 (double anonymous;\
  \ school psych coordinates that)  and the request list was nothing like what the\
  \ social service agency is giving out. We donate to another charity as well. \n\n\
  So... WIBTA if I got everything on this kids list except the controller (got a smaller\
  \ gift to have the three)?"
