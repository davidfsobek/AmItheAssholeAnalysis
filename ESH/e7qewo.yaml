selftext: 'So a few days ago I ordered a large pizza with a couple sides which came
  out to around $40. The next day when I went to go eat some leftovers (probably 75%
  left at least) I realized it wasn''t there. After asking around my one roommate
  said he threw it out because it was old. We went back and forth until I showed him
  my receipt from the night before which proved it wasn''t old. I insisted he pay
  me back but he said it was a simple mistake so he doesn''t owe me anything.

  Fast forward to today when my roommate bought himself a bunch of groceries for the
  week. After restocking his cabinets and fridge he immediately left to go hangout
  at his girlfriend''s house. So since he didn''t repay me, I took all his non-perishable
  food that he bought and donated it to the local food bank. He''s now insisting that
  I pay for his stuff that I "threw out" even though I insist that it''s just a simple
  mistake. Does that make me the asshole?'
