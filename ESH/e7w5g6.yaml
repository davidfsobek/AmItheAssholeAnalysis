selftext: "Wife's birthday is December 26th. As you can imagine, her birthday was\
  \ often lumped together with Christmas plans and gifts. My MIL was pretty bad about\
  \ this, I can easily imagine how my wife's childhood never really included a proper\
  \ birthday.  Once my wife turned 18, she wanted to start making up for it. She would\
  \ always plan a big party on her birthday, on the 26th, which was nice because friends\
  \ were always back in town.\n\nLast year she turned 40, and wanted to make a big\
  \ deal of it. Kids are getting older, so it's easier to travel again. She wanted\
  \ to do a big girls trip to Hawaii with ALL of her friends (many do not know eachother),\
  \ but only a few of her friends could do it - and she desperately wanted something\
  \ that could include everyone. So THREE separate trips were planned, three long-weekend\
  \ getaways, one not until after school got out months later. \n\nI attended ONE\
  \ dinner out with local friends later on, and none of the trips.  I stayed home\
  \ with the kids and paid for them. I say I paid because I earn 90%+ of the household\
  \ income, and barely got to be included in any of this - but that's what she wanted.\
  \ Heck, she even wanted to subsidize expenses at several junctions, like paying\
  \ for the AirBNB herself on one of the trips, paying for the concert tickets at\
  \ another, and buying a plane ticket for a friend who couldn't afford the trip on\
  \ a third case. \n\nSomething about the way her 40th went just broke me. I hate\
  \ her birthday now, and I've told her we need to scale this back in the future.\
  \ We've fought a ton about it, even long after the fact.\n\nSo this year she just\
  \ said let's go out to dinner on the 26th with our family, our kids and my relatives\
  \ back home (the people hosting us). Maybe reserve the party room at her favorite\
  \ restaurant. Honestly... that sounded perfectly reasonable. So I call my mother\
  \ to help coordinate the family, and my mother already planned to have the family\
  \ over to their house that night. My mother already had put a plan in motion. She\
  \ suggested we could still go out, but perhaps on the 28th - that would be more\
  \ fun, it's a Saturday night, and we invite friends to that one too. I dunno, sounded\
  \ like a nice compromise, so I said thanks and moved on.\n\nWife blew up when I\
  \ shared that with her. How dare I not follow her instructions and bow to my mother's\
  \ idea about HER birthday. Now it's a big drama that she got no vote on her own\
  \ birthday, and I took my mother's \"side\". In fairness, we both have mother issues\
  \ - we'll both do as our mothers wish instead of eachother. I have a hard time seeing\
  \ what my wife's done RIGHT in this whole scenario, it just feels horribly selfish\
  \ to make a drama once again about her birthday. But I'm really trying to figure\
  \ out if I've also done wrong in \"siding\" with my mother, not that it was a fight\
  \ or anything... but just... I thought it was a fair compromise. And a nice gesture\
  \ to begin with. But maybe I'm being super-insensitive because I'm just so fatigued\
  \ off the prior birthday(s)?"
