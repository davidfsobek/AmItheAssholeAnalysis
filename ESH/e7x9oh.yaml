selftext: "Context: I(23) live with my mother and sometimes my brother(27) when he's\
  \ not at his girlfriends house. Feel like I should throw in, I have a job and I'm\
  \ a full time student.\n\n\nYesterday all 4 of us were here at our house and my\
  \ mom and brother said \"we're going to x restaurant tomorrow for lunch\" kind of\
  \ in the way you tell a child they're doing something whether they like it or not.\
  \ They do this to me a lot. That annoys me because I'm not a child and they never\
  \ ask if I want to do things like this or if I have plans already. They just make\
  \ the plans themselves and I have to roll with it. I hate where they're going, hate\
  \ the food and I have other things I'd like to do tomorrow(today at this point)\
  \ than waste more money on something I don't even like but I agreed because whatever,\
  \ family outing. \n\nCome around to this morning, its 11 AM and I usually eat lunch\
  \ around this time because I wake up very early for work throughout the week. I\
  \ waited 2 hours(now 1PM) for my mom to get home from working out, she gets home\
  \ and instantly starts whining telling me to hurry up because she's hungry. She\
  \ cant even wait 5 minutes for me to get ready, then my brother asks me to drive\
  \ us in my car and at this point I'm just annoyed and say no this wasn't my idea\
  \ and I don't even really want to go to begin with. He starts ranting off saying\
  \ I'm such a fucking asshole, selfish and never do anything for anyone (he always\
  \ does this if he doesn't get his way). After hearing that for a few minutes I just\
  \ said \"fuck it, I'm not going and I'm tired of hearing this shit\" then my mom\
  \ joins in on the situation. I tell them both to fuck off and go by themselves(well\
  \ with his girlfriend too which is actually really sweet so I feel bad she has to\
  \ hear shit like this). They continued insulting me pretty much as they slam door\
  \ and here we are. Normally I feel like this wouldn't really be a big deal but after\
  \ being in situations like this even through my adulthood, especially when it has\
  \ to do with making decisions for me without asking, today I just wasn't having\
  \ it."
