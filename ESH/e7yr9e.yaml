selftext: 'Amy (19) and I have never gotten along well but what she did recently took
  the cake.


  I have followed a strict vegan diet for 12 years now, it''s something very important
  to me & Amy is not unaware of this. Her father and her have lived with me in my
  house now for 2 years and she has never had a right attitude. Always rude and snide,
  ordering her father around and trying to do the same to me, she even smokes weed
  in the room I let her sleep in despite me asking numerous times to do that outside
  of the house. Brings nonveg food over and hides it in her room (a strict rule I
  had for them moving in was no meat in the house), laughs in my face if I try to
  make her stop.


  Recently Amy and a group of her friends got high & thought it would be funny to
  replace all the stocks cubes in the house with beef ones. Cooked a stew and after
  eating it she pulls out an empty beef stock pack & laughs in my face asking if I
  liked the taste of cows and she guesses I''m just a regular murder now and can chill
  out.


  Waited for her to leave, removed her stuff & texted her that she was evicted from
  my house & could go stay at her friends instead. My boyfriend is very upset and
  his ex gf is hitting up my phone with insults over disrupting Amy''s life and schedule.
  I think after 2 years of disrespect I was too generous to begin with for not making
  her leave earlier.


  AITA for this?'
