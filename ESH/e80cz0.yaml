selftext: 'Would I be the asshole for telling my roommate to be more discreet with
  her vibrator. Two days ago I woke up to her telling me she just had the best shower
  then I go to use the bathroom later and her vibrator is just sitting on the floor
  of the bottom of the shower. I was a little grossed out but I was like okay maybe
  she forgot and then just waited for her to notice and it was still there this morning.
  I refused to take a shower those two days till she moves it, like I don''t wanna
  touch that thing. But she just got out of the shower just now and I went to check
  and ITS STILL THERE just in a different spot! Now it''s on the soap bar thing. Like
  I know everyone masterbates and good for her I don''t care but at least have some
  decency to not put your vibrator where I usually put my soap bar? Is it just me
  or is that gross? I don''t know where to go from here, she''s my friend but we don''t
  talk about this stuff and I don''t wanna seem like a dick.


  edit: i ended up telling her she left her personal item in the shower, she apologized
  and went and moved it, its all good now'
