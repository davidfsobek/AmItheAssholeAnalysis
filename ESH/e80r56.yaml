selftext: "We are first generation immigrants who are not Christians. I have a three\
  \ year old toddler and we live in America. \n\nMy family had been pressuring me\
  \ to put up a Christmas tree for last month or so. I did not want to start that\
  \ tradition with my kid since it seems very Christian to me and the kid can go see\
  \ Christmas trees anywhere right now. \n\n\nAfter the last round of discussion on\
  \ the topic, I told my family to drop it. This morning when I came back from market,\
  \ I noticed a giant tree put up and decorated. Apparently, my in-laws and husband\
  \ decided to just do it and surprise the kid with it. My kid is very excited and\
  \ loves the tree. \n\nI on the other hand, am furious. I feel it was very disrespectful\
  \ to do that in my house without considering what I wanted. So, am I the asshole\
  \ ?\n\nEdit: one of the main reasons I didn\u2019t want a tree in my house was it\
  \ is not a part of my culture. We just celebrated a couple of huge festivals and\
  \ I did decorate and put up stuff for it."
