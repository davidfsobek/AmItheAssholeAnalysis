selftext: "This is such a small issue but my sister is making a big deal of it and\
  \ I'm jumping back between whether or not I'm an asshole.\n\nSo our dad texted me\
  \ basically saying 'I'm going to go to work and then the bar, I'll bring home blunt\
  \ wraps on the way home since \\[your sister\\] has to have them.' For the past\
  \ half year my sister asks every day for blunt wraps on the way home, will do things\
  \ that we specifically ask her not to do (make us food, clean, etc) so that she\
  \ can then say that she did that for us so we should get her the blunts. If we say\
  \ no she gets mad or angry and gives us attitude all fucking day.\n\nSister then\
  \ asked to borrow my phone, no biggie. I let her. She comes back crying and says\
  \ 'dad texted you, I read what he SAID.' She was mad about the last comment about\
  \ how she has to have them. She ended up crying, have a full break down consisting\
  \ raising her voice and listing every wrong thing in her life (our mom died last\
  \ year, our dog died 6 months ago, her favorite rapper died today, dads being mean,\
  \ she's nearly out of weed, my dads girlfriend 4 years ago was mean to her, etc)\
  \ and basically recites every single way her life went wrong 2-3 times over while\
  \ scream yelling/raising her voice. BTW I'm normally okay listening to her vent\
  \ but I told her multiple times I am not okay or comfortable talking to her if she's\
  \ going to yell at me the whole time for things out of my control!\n\nShe leaves\
  \ and while she was gone I basically sent dad a text saying 'I fucked up, \\[sister\\\
  ] read the texts and it got me in trouble. Can you stop and pick up Chinese on the\
  \ way home?' \n\nShe comes back calmed down an hour later and wants to play sims.\
  \ I say sure. After a while she wants to take a break and asks if she can borrow\
  \ my phone to listen to music. I say sure. she unlocks it and my dumb ass forgot\
  \ to close the texting app and delete what I said to our dad. She got even more\
  \ mad and stormed away. \n\nSister then went in the bathroom that shares a wall\
  \ with my room and started to cry very loudly for 40 minutes straight. I feel bad\
  \ and don't want her to cry but jfc, she's literally going through my text messages.\
  \ The second one sure, that was my bad, but the first one she saw because SHE decided\
  \ to look through my thread and scroll up to see what our dad had said about the\
  \ blunt wraps.\n\nI shouldn't have to hide my texts, and I shouldn't have to worry\
  \ about my sister snooping through my shit. Besides, she does have an issue with\
  \ smoking and she DOES ask for blunts every day. My dad said earlier that it feels\
  \ like he only lives to get her weed and blunts. It's ridiculous. Instead of asking\
  \ why I was upset or why I felt like I was in trouble, she jumped the gun and got\
  \ mad. \n\nAITA for what I texted my dad? :/"
