selftext: 'Been married seven years. I''m 35M, she''s 34F. We have one daughter 5F
  and one son 9moM. For more context about our family: I make a lot of money. My wife
  is unemployed and has been unemployed since we met. The house is mine, the two cars
  are mine, etc. I mean, they''re both of ours, but I purchased them for the family.


  My wife decided to spring onto me two weeks ago that she wants to explore a polyromantic
  relationship. She has no one in mind but is excited about the potential and asks
  if I''m up for it. My answer is a resounding no because I agreed to monogamy when
  we married. We actively discussed this beforehand, too, and I thought we were on
  the same page.


  This is where I may be the asshole: my wife has zero bargaining power here. To put
  it very bluntly, she doesn''t make enough money to make this kind of suggestion
  or demand. She has said me not accepting her polyromanticism is putting our relationship
  into jeopardy and while I may lose a lot in a divorce or separation, she''s 34 with
  no degree, no job prospects, no ambition to be honest. Her life would be hard, even
  with alimony. Mine would not, nor would our children.


  I won''t budge and it seems like she won''t budge. No amount of discussion has resolved
  this, we''re both set in our ways. It looks like separation is on the horizon.


  All it would take is for me to accept things and our family remains whole, but I
  won''t. Our family will break apart because we can''t come to an agreement. Our
  children will go to-and-fro between two homes, maybe many stepparents. I feel for
  our children but I have to stick by my own principles, right?


  AITA?'
