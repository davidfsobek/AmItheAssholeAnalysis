selftext: 'I work in a financial services company (in Australia) and recently my colleagues
  have been discussing salaries to see if everyone''s paid fairly.  It''s a medium
  sized company and we have \~500 people across Australia.  The average pay for my
  job is $120k and the others are paid approximately that, however I am paid significantly
  more by virtue of knowing a couple people in HR and in management.  I also went
  to Yale for undergrad, and ICMS in Sydney for postgrad while my co worker have all
  gone to local universities.  Anyways, when I was asked how much I was being paid,
  I gave a similar number to the average pay because I was told by my friend at HR
  that if the other employee''s kicked up a fuss about my salary, I''d be taking a
  pay cut.  And as much as I don''t like to admit it, I don''t want to take a salary
  cut because I''m still paying off my student loans & giving money to my parents
  occasionally (because I''m Asian).


  So AITA for lying about my salary to by colleagues so I don''t take a pay cut?


  I''m happy to answer any questions for clarification or more info.


  EDIT: Am using a throwaway because the people I work with know my reddit'
