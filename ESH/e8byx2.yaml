selftext: "So, right of the bat, I am well convinced that the climate is changing\
  \ for the worse. I believe that my relative flat country will suffer along the coastlines,\
  \ climate refugees will be come a huge issues and we will likely suffer ressource-wise.\
  \ Basically, a light apocalypse.\n\nMy parents having the age that they have, 52\
  \ and 60, will likely never experience these consequences. I being 25, most likely\
  \ will and any child I put into the world. They merely shrug and keep on traveling\
  \ (6 times a year by plane), refuse to recycle and talking about getting another\
  \ car.\n\nWith that gruesome intro over, let's get to the recent argument. My mom\
  \ and dad has announced that, they are now ready for grandchildren and they keep\
  \ dropping hints, that I should \"go make one\". I'm single and not really in a\
  \ place to raise a child (still working on my education). On top of that, I have\
  \ aforementioned view on impending disaster. So when I told them, that they shouldn't\
  \ get their hopes up, they called me selfish.\n\nI told them I could consider it\
  \ in the future if I saw them show some more enviromental care, but then things\
  \ escalated. I am right now being accused of blackmailing my parents into the climate\
  \ agenda.\n\nWhen all it comes down to is: I wont feel comfortable putting children\
  \ into such a world and I'm not ready for children anyway. And even if I was, I\
  \ would like to see said childs parents take an interest in leaving a better world\
  \ for a grandchild. \n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: I do want to have kids, I am not baiting\
  \ my parents into thinking it."

  if they want grandkids?
