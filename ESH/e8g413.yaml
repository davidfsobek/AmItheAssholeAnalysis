selftext: "So Im a college student living in a single which is super close to housemates\
  \ room. You can hear pretty much everything through the wall, even casual conversations.\
  \ \n\nInfo about housemates: theyre a couple (which is why i figured they wouldnt\
  \ mind the sex thing but they do) around the same age as me (22). They get into\
  \ loud arguments on occasion, take showers together which i can gear, and talk late\
  \ at night every so often, the guy works a late shift sometimes and wakes me up\
  \ to some noises which i dont mind. I havent complained about any of these things\
  \ because i can just put on my airpods and go back to sleep and both us can do what\
  \ we want to do. I would like them to take the same approach when they hear me in\
  \ various situations, mostly importantly sexual ones. I just wanted to make sure\
  \ i was being reasonable before going forward with this because i do like them as\
  \ roommates otherwise, the only problem we have is noise related. Side note they\
  \ have complained about me talking to the girl im dating in my room somewhat late\
  \ at night but then proceeded to do the same thing a couple days later which kind\
  \ of upset me. The girl does seem to dislike the person im dating which may be a\
  \ factor or maybe im just being unreasonable. I do think the fact that theyre a\
  \ couple wouldve made them happy to be able to have sex whenever they want  but\
  \ they seem kinda old fashioned about how it makes them uncomfortable. I have heard\
  \ them having sex coming home once but not otherwise, they stopped once i got home\
  \ which is kinda sad imo. \n\nThanks for the time and lemme know if you have any\
  \ questions"
title: WIBTA if i asked my housemates to put on headphones/earplugs if they dont want
