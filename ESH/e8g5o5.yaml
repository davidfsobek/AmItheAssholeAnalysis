selftext: "My ex-wife and I are recently divorced and have 2 girls. Caught her having\
  \ an affair, she separated, kept having the affair, skipped holidays with the kids,\
  \ etc. She's pretty awful. \n\nSince we've been divorced, she's been nickel-and-diming\
  \ me almost as a form of harassment. For example, we put our oldest in an art therapist\
  \ to make sure she was handling the divorce well and just was well equipped to work\
  \ through any emotions she may feel. Because I work and my ex doesn't, she takes\
  \ her to the appointment every week. Our agreement states that I cover 75% of healthcare\
  \ costs, and she cover the remaining 25%. It also states that I need to provide\
  \ receipts within 30 days and give her 30 days to pay. About a month and a half\
  \ after the divorce was finalized, I said \"hey the total for (oldest daughter's)\
  \ therapy was $1,000, so your total is $250. Her response: I'll pay $150 because\
  \ you did not provide receipts within 30 days. \n\nI figured because she took her\
  \ to the appointment, and even she knew exactly how much each one costs, that this\
  \ kind of fell more in the realm of common decency and common sense. She's technically\
  \ right, but still an asshole. \n\nOur girls are the flower girls in my brothers\
  \ wedding this weekend. We split the kids 50/50, and this weekend is her weekend\
  \ with them. For the day of the wedding, I offered to pick them up from her house\
  \ (completely out of the way for me) and drive them to the wedding, I'll have them\
  \ all day, and asked her if she would pick them up after the ceremony is over, since\
  \ I have to go do wedding party things, and the reception, which is a no kids allowed\
  \ type thing.\n\nIt's about 30 miles from her house, 25 from mine. She's insistent\
  \ that I should be paying for her gas money to pick up the kids. I think that's\
  \ absurd. She says \"she'd doing me a favor\", and I say this isn't some favor \u2013\
  \ this is my brothers wedding, and the girls are in it. \n\nAm I the asshole here?"

  a wedding they're in?
