selftext: "For context, my husband and I have 4 kids together. His mother passed away,\
  \ but even before that we did not have much interaction with his family. \n\nMy\
  \ mother passed away 8 years ago. I don't interact much with my sisters (one took\
  \ off to Florida years ago after abandoning 3 of her children and is in and out\
  \ of prison and the other is not a nice person.) My oldest sibling and only brother,\
  \ we'll call him J, is my only close family. He raised me along with two of his\
  \ own children. I love him and his wife, L, rediculously.\n\nNow here's the issue:\
  \ his wife's family has always taken precedence in his eyes. When I was younger\
  \ and living with them I was always included but not made to *feel* included. Christmas\
  \ meant watching L and J's kids get tons of presents from their aunts and uncles\
  \ (L is one of 6, and then their extended family too). L and J always got me something,\
  \ so no big deal and I was a teenager anyway so it didn't really matter.\n\nThen\
  \ I had my own kids. My brother and I grew apart. I stopped doing birthday parties\
  \ for my kids because other than J and L, we had no family to invite. They never\
  \ wanted to come to my house for holiday dinners because L's mom (and now L) does\
  \ the dinner thing. Eventually they stopped buying presents for my kids even though\
  \ we still brought stuff for theirs. Invites to their functions became more and\
  \ more belated until they stopped altogether.\n\n\nA couple days ago I shared a\
  \ meme on Facebook about family sticking together and all of a sudden I get a message\
  \ from J about how we should come over for Christmas dinner. I politely declined\
  \ and he pushed for a reason why. So I told him that not only do we have our own\
  \ dinner planned and traditions that we observe, I didn't feel comfortable making\
  \ my children go through another year of watching their cousins open piles of gifts\
  \ from L's family while mine sit there with nothing. He was angry and blocked me\
  \ after telling me that I was ungrateful for everything he and L had done for me.\n\
  \n I understand that Christmas isn't about the presents and my children should be\
  \ grateful to spend time with family, but here's the thing. They only ever get presents\
  \ from me and their dad. We're not rich, so they don't really get a lot to begin\
  \ with, but they are extremely grateful for what they do recieve. \n\nI'm just tired\
  \ of watching my kids feel hurt because their cousins have more family than they\
  \ do, basically.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n**Edit:** For clarity, my brother and his\
  \ wife raised me. Her family is very closeknit, and I've been involved with them\
  \ since I moved in with my brother at 12yo. I'm 35 now. \n\nWhat I'm really upset\
  \ about, I guess, is realizing that me and my kids aren't really as much a part\
  \ of that family as I had always been told.\n\nIt is the feeling that while these\
  \ \"family members\" were out picking out gifts for people they love, no one thought\
  \ of my kids. There are other things that contribute to this, not least of which\
  \ is that my brother didn't bother to even message my kids on their birthdays this\
  \ year."
