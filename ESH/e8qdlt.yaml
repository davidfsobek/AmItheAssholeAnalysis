selftext: "So my girlfriend for about a year has a habit of complaining about her\
  \ job... She's underpaid she's underappreciated she doesn't feel like an equal to\
  \ the other girls... Now I'm all for getting the bad stuff out... I'll even sit\
  \ there like a therapist ... but the other day I snapped and told her I can't listen\
  \ to her complain anymore without offering advice -apparently I'm just supposed\
  \ to listen- ... \"How many job applications have you put out?\" .. \"are you even\
  \ looking for another job or do you just like complaining about this one?\" \nI\
  \ snapped ... In the nicest way -that I know how- I looked her dead in the eyes\
  \ and I told her I don't want to hear her complaining about her job if she's not\
  \ doing anything to change it.\n\nAm I the asshole?"
