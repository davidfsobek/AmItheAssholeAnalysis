selftext: "Hi, this is a throwaway as I don\u2019t want this linked to my main account.\
  \ Apologies for mobile formatting yada yada.\n\nSo I\u2019ll get right into it.\
  \ I (19m) go to a top university in the UK. I am a second year and live with my\
  \ ex girlfriend (19f) and 3 of our mutual friends. This came about because in my\
  \ first year, I started dating my now ex near the start of Uni and we all decided\
  \ to live together for second year. Near the end of the year she cheated on me by\
  \ sleeping with some random bloke she\u2019d pulled in a club. I confronted her\
  \ and broke it off. \n\nFast forward to September and the arrangement is now very\
  \ awkward as we\u2019re not on speaking terms, yet share a house. There is a lot\
  \ of tension and mutual dislike in the air. She has done a lot of petty things so\
  \ far this year which I won\u2019t get into, but safe to say she\u2019s pissed off\
  \ everyone in the house and there are arguments almost daily. \n\nWell a couple\
  \ of nights ago I was coming back from a night out with my friends at around 2 or\
  \ 3am, and it\u2019s possibly important here to note that she doesn\u2019t have\
  \ any friends at university, whereas I am involved in several societies, was always\
  \ the \u2018popular\u2019 social butterfly of our house, go out multiple times a\
  \ week etc and that this was always a point of contention during our relationship\
  \ as, though she didn\u2019t like to admit it, she was always jealous. \n\nI went\
  \ into the kitchen to fill up a bottle of water. I\u2019m quite drunk at this point.\
  \ Well lo and behold she is in there and turns to me to say something along the\
  \ lines of \u2018drunk again?\u2019 With a smirk and belittled me for enjoying myself.\
  \ I said it\u2019s not my fault she\u2019s a loner and that nobody likes her, we\
  \ argued a bit about cleaning and other household issues. She then says that at\
  \ least Adam liked her and that\u2019s why she cheated because he was better than\
  \ me, which really pissed me off.\n\nI mention how lonely it must be to have no\
  \ friends and family being so far away and ask if she heard me the other night with\
  \ a girl I\u2019d brought home. She said she\u2019s glad she hurt me and asked if\
  \ I\u2019ve mentally recovered. She knew I had on and off mental health issues while\
  \ we dated. Which was the final straw as I had further mental health issues for\
  \ most of that summer as a direct result of her. I said to her, shouting, \u2018\
  at least my daddy didn\u2019t fucking leave me when I was 5, if he could see you\
  \ now he\u2019d leave all over again you dirty little cunt.\u2019\n\nShe burst out\
  \ crying and ran from the kitchen. She had her mum pick her up the next day, and\
  \ I haven\u2019t seen her since. My housemates, who already dislike her are on my\
  \ side. My friends and family are also on my side for the most part. \nI knew her\
  \ insecurities from our time together and said the most hurtful thing I could muster,\
  \ specifically targeting what I knew would cause the most pain and distress and\
  \ probably took it too far, so while I hate her, I\u2019m aware I\u2019m probably\
  \ in the wrong, though remorse still eludes me. \n\nSo Reddit, AITA?"
