selftext: "EDIT: I have now realized that I am the a-hole in this situation\n\nI\u2019\
  m in ninth grade and today we were supposed to present a group task which we have\
  \ been working on for several weeks in English class. \nThere are two other students\
  \ in my group and we had all worked together on making a keynote on our subject,\
  \ it was finished and we just had to do the presentation. Our teacher said we could\
  \ do it today and we all agreed we would do it. I spend some time at home to practice\
  \ on what I should say during the presentation. \n\nWhen I show up to class today\
  \ one of the girls in my group tell me that they don\u2019t want to do the presentation\
  \ because they \u201Chaven\u2019t prepared enough\u201D. I was pretty shocked and\
  \ told her I still wanted to do it. I also told her it\u2019s not my fault you didn\u2019\
  t practice when you knew that we were doing the presentation today. She still refused\
  \ to do it and I got really annoyed with her because our teacher got mad at us for\
  \ not being prepared despite me being really ready. Eventually I told her that we\
  \ are going to do it whether she likes it or not and I just raised my hand and said:\
  \ \u201C we are ready now, we can do it\u201D.\n\nSo we did it and it went really\
  \ well for me but not so much for her. Afterwards she came up to me and told I just\
  \ ruined her grades, the other person I\u2019m my group then filled her in and said\
  \ he would have been open to doing it another day and our teacher also said we could\
  \ have stayed after school and do it if we wanted to. \n\nI don\u2019t think I did\
  \ anything wrong since she knew what she was supposed to do and didn\u2019t do it\
  \ and it shouldn\u2019t affect me that she didn\u2019t do it\n\nAm I the asshole??"
