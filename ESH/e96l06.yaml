selftext: "Myself, a cousin, and my step-dad are all into photography and one of my\
  \ cousin's kids who is about 11 also picked it up in the last year, mainly on an\
  \ iphone, but occasionally with one of our nice ($1500-4500) cameras. She has gone\
  \ through a tough time with family drama and I have an old camera that I would like\
  \ to give her for Christmas, which might go swimmingly. It's a nice camera but was\
  \ originally released in 2009 so it doesn't have some of the same capabilities.\
  \ All of the lenses she would use though would be the exact same ones that we currently\
  \ use, edits with the same programs, similar, but not as complicated controls. Newer\
  \ versions of this camera are what you typically see with over enthusiastic soccer\
  \ moms.\n\nThe issue - she has pointed out to her grandfather cameras that are out\
  \ of their price range that she wants $1500+ and while they would love to get her\
  \ one, it's not going to happen. My step dad also offered her a nice point and shoot\
  \ that he has, but she wanted his big, expensive, professional grade camera or nothing\
  \ and acted like a brat when she didn't get it. \n\nWe are all on board with explaining\
  \ that this is the perfect starter camera for her, even if it's older, but she might\
  \ also throw a fit because of that. If she does, would it be appropriate to take\
  \ it back? Obviously, it wouldn't be a \"this isn't the one I wanted\" FINE \\*takes\
  \ it back\\* \"You get nothing choosy beggar\" but at a certain point, should it\
  \ go there? It's the only thing I'm really nervous about."
