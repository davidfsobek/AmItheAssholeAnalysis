selftext: "OK I know this sounds horrible but let me explain. There's this girl at\
  \ my school. I'll call her Ashley. She torments my girlfriend Rebecca all the time,\
  \ gangs up on her with her friends, films her on her phone and awful things like\
  \ that. \n\nAshley is mixed race. Her mum is white, her dad is (I believe) pakistani.\
  \ She's not religious at all. She dates white guys, drinks alcohol and smokes weed\
  \ at parties. However she still follows the tradition of not eating pork which is\
  \ fair enough. \n\nWe were walking through the corridor and having lunch. Ashley\
  \ and her gang followed us and she got her phone out and tried to film us, calling\
  \ us freaks and stuff like that. I was eating pork sausages so got one out and waved\
  \ it in front of her. It made her stay away from us and eventually leave. \n\nI\
  \ got pulled out of class and got told that a ''racist incident'' had been reported\
  \ against me. This good get me in serious trouble. I'm sorry but I'm not a racist.\
  \ She's a vile bully who torments my girl and nobody does anything. If it made her\
  \ go away then I have no regrets."
