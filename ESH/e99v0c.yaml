selftext: "\nI just moved to a city and I commute by train. I got on a train that\
  \ was packed and the only empty seat had a ratty looking jacket on it. I assumed\
  \ someone had forgotten it ditched their jacket and everyone was just too much of\
  \ a germaphobe to touch it (I'm not being sassy, I really thought that). \n\nI'm\
  \ not easily grossed out so I went over and sat down on the seat. A girl next to\
  \ me snapped at me to get off her coat, and I was like \"Oops, thought it was junk\
  \ someone had forgotten\"and i pulled it out from under me and gave it to her. She\
  \ went \"excuse me\" and I looked at her like \"what??\" Confused if she was trying\
  \ to get by, or wanting to say something more. But she didn't say anything more\
  \ until the train stopped and she went by me and called me a bitch on the way out.\n\
  \nAITA?"
