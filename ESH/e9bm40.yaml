selftext: 'Last December, I adopted a cat from a shelter. I paid the fee that covered
  identification and sterilization, and was now officially the owner.

  About a month later, I got a call from the shelter.

  The original owner who lost it had seen photos of him on the Facebook page of the
  shelter, and wanted it back.

  The shelter refused to give her my coordinates. They told me to not publish photos
  of him on the shelter page so she could not find me. They asked my what my choice
  was, but said they thought I should keep him. They said the cat had gone away when
  the previous owner had left the door of their apartment open, and there was probably
  a reason a cat would go away. They also said she had probably not looked hard enough
  for him, since they didn''t find search requests for him when they found him. But
  they also said that the person had photos proving it was really their cat, and she
  genuinely looked sad to not be able to get him back. I went with their advice and
  kept him. Now he has a brother cat to play with, a big house, and a big garden near
  the nature. From a material point of view at least, I think he will have a better
  life here. But as I am nearing the anniversary of his adoption, I can'' t help but
  think about it again, and wondering if I made the right choice.'

  it found photos of him on the shelter's page?
