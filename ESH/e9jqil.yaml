selftext: "I can home from a work trip to my apartment at 80F. Immediately started\
  \ to sweat balls. I had to open all the doors and windows to air the dam thing out.\
  \ The thermostat was set to 78. Here\u2019s the worst part, must roommate wasn\u2019\
  t home. Didn\u2019t come home for 2 days. So this butt lick was just going to leave\
  \ the heat on for 2 days. I keep turning the dam thing down but he turns it up when\
  \ I fall asleep. I wake up in the middle of the night drenched. \n\nI\u2019m gonna\
  \ have a talk with him tomorrow. Tell him basically that I normally keep my apartment\
  \ at 65F. And 62F when I\u2019m not home. I will try and compromise with him and\
  \ will go as high as 68. And if I catch the thermostat above 68 then he is responsible\
  \ for the heat bill and I won\u2019t pay a dime. WIBTA if I gave him this ultimatum?\
  \ \n\nThis is our first winter together. He\u2019s one of those people that doesn\u2019\
  t wear socks and only wears shorts. Buy a dam space heater. Stop heating the whole\
  \ dam apartment"
