selftext: "I\u2019m 16, in high school, so pardon me if my judgement is super clouded.\
  \ \n\nThere\u2019s a woman who smokes outside of my house every day as I\u2019m\
  \ going to the bus stop. I don\u2019t even know where she lives she specifically\
  \ does it a few inches from my lawn, on the sidewalk and just stands there and smokes.\
  \ I hate walking through thick clouds of smoke. It smells bad, it tastes bad, I\
  \ just hate everything about smoking. If that\u2019s something you choose to do\
  \ with your life, that\u2019s fine by me but just don\u2019t do it in front of my\
  \ house, please. Well anyway, I\u2019ve been pondering these last few months what\
  \ would happen if I just pretended to have a coughing fit right near her. Me asking\
  \ her to move is out of the question. I don\u2019t want to be rude, but I am NOT\
  \ speaking to a total stranger outside of my house. I just want her to stop or at\
  \ least do it somewhere else."
