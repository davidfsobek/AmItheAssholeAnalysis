selftext: 'It''s the same old story of my dad cheating on my mom and marrying his
  affair partner. This went down two years ago.


  My dad''s family has kind of accepted my dad''s new wife. I have never accepted
  her. But  I''m not screaming at them or anything.


  What brings me to ask if I am the asshole is the fact I go to every family event
  and make it super awkward for my dad and his wife.


  Once, I saw them arrive and said "Uh oh, hold on to your husbands everyone."


  And during Thanksgiving, I said I was thankful that my mom had found a real man
  who was loyal and strong for once. This was referring to her new boyfriend.


  Stupid comments like that.


  My comments usually make my grandparents laugh but my dad and his wife are very
  clearly uncomfortable and embarassed.


  But I keep getting invited back to these events. I just figured feeling uncomfortable
  is a small price to pay after destroying family.


  My dad has apologized for the affair and has asked me to stop with the comments
  but I don''t think I will.


  AITA?'
