selftext: 'I am 15 years old m yesterday I went to Domino''s with a friend. We were
  very hungry so we ordered a thick crust pizza. When we got it it was a thin crust
  I took it to the cashier who was very rude and disrespectful. He raised his voice
  at me and told me I didn''t say it right and that he put it in the machine. I said
  fuck it and ate it.Today while eating breakfast I remembered what happened and felt
  very pissed off and that he should be punished for disrespecting me so I called
  the Domino''s hotline and reported the incident. After I told my mom and she kinda
  got mad at me because he could lose his job for one incident. And I kinda felt bad
  after. AITA?

  PS: I always hated people who think the can treat teens and kids like subhumans
  just because they are older so that was one of the reasons I was pissed off because
  I honestly think if I was older I would''ve been treated with more respect'
