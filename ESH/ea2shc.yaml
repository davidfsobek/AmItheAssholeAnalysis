selftext: "Throwaway account for obvious reasons.\n\nI'm a parent of three children.\
  \ The oldest two are 8 years old and the youngest is 5.  Their mom, let's call her\
  \ Jess for convenience (obviously not her real name). Jess often goes on various\
  \ fads about certain things then quits them in like a month. \n\nThe most extreme\
  \ one is climate change. She'd be absolutely into it for like a month. Basically\
  \ on that month she would stop buying plastic, start going to protests, install\
  \ solar-panels and she even went to our savings account and purchased an electric\
  \ car. Next month she would completely quit, start buying plastic and ultimately\
  \ stop bothering anymore.\n\nThis happened multiple times with different things\
  \ every time, so the family is pretty much used to it. One day she read some stuff\
  \ on the internet, watched a few videos and randomly decided to become vegan. She\
  \ started cooking only vegan meals. Me and the kids weren't exactly fans of those\
  \ meals as we were avid meat-eaters.\n\nNow it was okay for me because I could eat\
  \ meat outside the house. She knows that I do and she doesn't try to change me because\
  \ she knows how hard-headed I am. But the kids only eat home-cooked meals so it\
  \ was way worse for them. Nevertheless, we were patient because we knew she will\
  \ quit it within a month. However, it seems that this time is different because\
  \ it's been three months and she's still just as obsessed as the first day. I figured\
  \ it's a prolonged fad this time, and we'd wait it out.\n\nThe kids have voiced\
  \ their opinions many times about not wanting to go vegan. Their mom didn't budge,\
  \ though. So when the mom was at work, I would take them with me to eat whatever\
  \ meats and dairy they liked. They've had vegan ice-cream and didn't like it at\
  \ all, so I started to take them once a week to have ice-cream. I told them it's\
  \ our little secret. \n\nRegardless, something happened two days ago that fueled\
  \ my frustration and anger even more. One of the 8 year olds had informed me that\
  \ their mom showed them animal abuse videos. The animal butchering videos a vegan\
  \ would show someone to convince them to become vegan, basically. Apparently she\
  \ also told them not to tell me. \n\nI've gotten into a huge argument with her yesterday\
  \ over it and I made sure she wouldn't take her anger out on the kid who told me.\
  \ She started sobbing and saying it's for the best; that the kids needed to learn\
  \ this by an early age and not harm animals like she did her whole life. I felt\
  \ sympathetic with her but told her that it's not a good thing to enforce your beliefs\
  \ on kids, and to educate them and let them decide by themselves; which she already\
  \ did.\n\nI'm planning on telling her that I've been taking the kids to eat meat\
  \ and dairy when the time is right, because I don't like hiding things from my wife.\
  \ Although I'd only tell her once her vegan craze begins to fade. AITA?"
