selftext: "Backstory....\nHusband (32) and I (32F) have been together 7 years. His\
  \ brother (26) and wife (25) have been together 5 years. Years ago, after meeting\
  \ her a few times, my husband casually mentioned what his brothers \"hot little\
  \ thing will be wearing\".  Fast forward a year or so, SIL is at a party at our\
  \ house. She mentions to her friends and me that I am too old to get pregnant and\
  \ I'll be in menopause soon. Brother and SIL continue throughout the years to mention\
  \ how old my husband and I are. I have chosen to just ignore her because I don't\
  \ know what else to do...\n\nFast forward to current, turns out I can't get pregnant\
  \ due to severe Endo and we have 2 foster toddlers. SIL is now 6 months pregnant\
  \ with their first. At the last family function, I ignored her, as usual and tended\
  \ to the toddlers. My husband gets a call a month later from my MIL saying SIL was\
  \ upset that I ignored her my MIL is upset that I can't be friendly with her. \n\
  \nMy husband wants to talk things out with his brother and SIL and says it's driving\
  \ a wedge between us and his family. AITA for not wanting to patch things up? I\
  \ told him I'm not sorry for ignoring her and will continue to do so."
