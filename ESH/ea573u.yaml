selftext: "AITA: our washer broke, it\u2019s a large capacity whirlpool duet, less\
  \ than 10 years old, the repair will cost about $350-$400 for a new motherboard\
  \ (and we already spent $125 on a diagnostic assessment to tell us what the Internet\
  \ already told me based on an error code). My in laws have a spare cheap washer\
  \ that we can have for free. Not fancy, basic top loader, but it works, so it\u2019\
  s already better than ours. \n\nMy husband is so enamored with buying a new one\
  \ that I can\u2019t even talk to him about repair vs replace with a used one. \u201C\
  The new ones have sensors that are gentler in your clothes, and they use less electricity,\
  \ and less water!\u201D He says he hasn\u2019t decided, but he wants to take the\
  \ time to research. Meanwhile, I\u2019ve been 1.5 weeks without a washer, using\
  \ our in laws, and letting the laundry pile up. I finally got frustrated when he\
  \ accused me of being an ass and trying to be cheap and take the cheapest option\
  \ without considering the problem, and I told him he is being a stubborn idiot trying\
  \ to spend money when we have a free option readily available.\n\nAccepting my judgement,\
  \ but I should say, he called me a cheap ass before I called him a stubborn idiot."
