  My friends were messing with me by throwing chickpeas at me during lunch. Even after
  I told them to stop. I told them the next person that throws something at me I will
  pour milk on them. My friend didn''t take me seriously and threw one at me and I
  poured chocolate milk all over him. He got mad then screamed at me and Stormed out
  of the lunchroom. AITA?'
