selftext: "I'm facing a ridiculous issue with my gf. I'm 25 she's 23.\nShe is on Instagram\
  \ and posts photos of herself maybe once a month or sometimes a bit more. She has\
  \ mentioned a few times that it would make her really happy if I could comment on\
  \ her photos. \nI'm on Instagram as well but not very active and I think this is\
  \ ridiculous. I'm busy with life and I don't have the time for stupid stuff like\
  \ this.\n\nYesterday she told me that she had posted a photo. Today she asked me\
  \ if I could comment it or at least leave a like. I said I'd get to it but I have\
  \ other things on my mind.\nShe seemed really sad and said it only takes 30 seconds\
  \ and would make her really happy. She also said that I was on Facebook this morning\
  \ so why not switch to Instagram for a few seconds. And she said that I shouldn't\
  \ bother commenting after days because apparently then the post is old.\n\nI think\
  \ this is all ridiculous but she did seem quite sad so I'm wondering AITA?"
