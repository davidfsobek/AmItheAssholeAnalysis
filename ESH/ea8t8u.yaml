selftext: A person I know let's say Terry got into an ivy league college yesterday.
  However, he says deeply racist things on social media and in school to me and it
  bothers me that he got accepted to such a prestigious college. I've recorded instances
  (on social media and discord) of him being racist and was thinking about sending
  it to the admissions office at the college he was accepted.  I talked to my parents
  about it and they said it likely wouldn't make a difference, I would be a bad person
  for doing, etc.  Like I shouldn't try to damage his life substantially over this.
  So reddit, WIBTA?

  he got into?
