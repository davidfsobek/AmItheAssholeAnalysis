selftext: "actually happened today, about an hour ago\n\nfor background, i'm (19m)\
  \ 6'1 and around 135 lbs, and i eat about once or twice a day. i live with my grandmother\
  \ (70f) and my aunt (45f) comes to visit daily\n\nlunch was brought up in a conversation\
  \ with my aunt, grandmother, and cousin (24m). my aunt asked my cousin if he'd like\
  \ to join them for lunch, and he declined. she looked at me, and stated that she\
  \ knew i wouldn't come, as i don't ever really go out to eat with them, and then\
  \ made a comment about me looking anorexic (i get comments like this once every\
  \ few days) an argument ensued, and i stated once again that i've eaten as much\
  \ as i do all my life, and i'm relatively healthy. my aunt then commented that regardless,\
  \ i looked like a \"toothpick\" and a \"starving Ethiopian\", to which i replied\
  \ \"you look like a whale, but i don't tell you that\" \n\nmy grandmother and aunt\
  \ are both extremely mad at me, with my grandmother citing that i'm a vicious and\
  \ cruel person. i felt like i was leveling the playing field but anyway\n\nreddit,\
  \ AITA?\n\nedit: i've tried ignoring them, laughing it off, walking away, and explaining\
  \ how i have no control over it, and the comments have continued. it wasn't meant\
  \ to be mean, but rather to try to stop them from commenting about my weight and\
  \ eating habits, since nothing else works"
