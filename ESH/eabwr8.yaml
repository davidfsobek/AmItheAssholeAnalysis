selftext: "I've been hanging out with a bunch of people for a couple of years and\
  \ as its a large group we have people leave and join quite a lot. 2 years ago a\
  \ girl joined, we got to talking and have been dating since then. \n\nAbout 6 months\
  \ ago one of the guys approached me and asked me what she was to me, when I mentioned\
  \ we'd been dating for a while he seem dejected and said \"Oh, I've had a crush\
  \ on her for a long time\". It was a tad awkward and I didn't know what to say so\
  \ just went \"Sorry buddy\". He approached me 3 months later and asked if we were\
  \ still together then went on a rant about how lonely he is and that he hasn't had\
  \ sex in over 3 years. I tried giving the usual advice that he needs to put himself\
  \ out there and sign up for dating sites. He said he does that but doesn't have\
  \ any success.\n\nHe's quite a large guy so I tried gently hinting that he should\
  \ hit the gym and work on himself a bit and see if he has any success. He seemed\
  \ quite dejected and uninterested in that so I gave up.\n\nI was out last weekend\
  \ with a friend and he apparently approached said friend and asked him if I was\
  \ still with my GF and whether we were having any problem, then finally asking \"\
  Will they break up soon?\". I admittedly laughed when I was told about it and ignored\
  \ it.\n\nTonight he finally approached me again and said \"You need to break up\
  \ with her please, I really love her and you don't seem to\". This is due to me\
  \ and my GF have a sort of game when we trash talk each other non-stop, it's all\
  \ in good fun and we deeply love each other.\n\nI was rather annoyed that he's still\
  \ going on about this and told him to fuck off, he kept hounding me and in the end\
  \ I just said \"No woman will love you as long as you stay so fat\". He was upset\
  \ and walked out.\n\nI feel kinda bad but at the same point this has been going\
  \ on for 6 months, AITA?"
