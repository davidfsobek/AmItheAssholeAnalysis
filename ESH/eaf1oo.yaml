selftext: "I share a bathroom with 3 other people. 2 of them never flush the toilet.\
  \ \n\nNow it's only pee when they dont flush, but it bothers me to have to look\
  \ at any type of their bodily fluids. (Which for the record always looks dark AF\
  \ and smells up the whole bathroom. Drink some damn water.)\n\nI have talked to\
  \ both of them one day kind of joking but still saying how it bothers me. To which\
  \ one laughed and replied yeah but Im just going keep doing it. Which they have.\
  \ \n\nMy next resort was a bright thought. If I dont flush my poops they are bound\
  \ to say something about it. To which I can then reply, let's make a deal. I flush\
  \ if you flush. \n\nIdk probably not the right way of going about it. But I'll finish\
  \ what I started. \n\nAm I using my asshole wisely or Am I the asshole?"
