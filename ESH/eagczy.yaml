selftext: "So yeah.  I came home from work today, grabbed something to eat.  My two\
  \ kids, three and seven, were in the living room with my wife, older kid completely\
  \ asleep on the couch.  My wife came over to me and leaned in, told me that our\
  \ older kid had had multiple meltdowns tonight.  When she says meltdowns, this means\
  \ pretty much freaking out, hyperventilating, crying, tantrumming---usually over\
  \ absolutely trivial things.  The other kid touched one of his toys he wasn't using.\
  \  He was asked to not throw dirty socks on the floor.  We're out of bananas.  He\
  \ lied and got called on it.  Whatever.  Absolute no-reason-for-this-eruption freakouts.\
  \  Reasoning and explaining gets us nowhere, and oftentimes we have to put him in\
  \ his own room alone as it's the only thing that calms him down, even though it\
  \ causes him to freak out three times as hard at first as he thinks he's being exiled\
  \ and not loved.  He is \\*very\\* loved.\n\nFor clarity, he is in therapy for impulse\
  \ control, ADHD, and personality concerns.  He's always been....\"sensitive\" about\
  \ everything.  And my wife and I have talked about getting him on to some form of\
  \ medication to help him.  We didn't want to go that route initially, tried therapy\
  \ and other strategies, but it's gotten to the point now that we're pretty convinced\
  \ we should try something.  Also for clarity, my wife is a medical professional\
  \ with the ability to write prescriptions for her patients.\n\nSo my wife leans\
  \ in, explains the meltdowns, and tells me she gave the kid half of a clonidine\
  \ pill (she had some left over from a previous prescription).  I told her I wasn't\
  \ okay with that, that she should have consulted me, that I'm pretty sure it's illegal\
  \ to give children drugs that aren't prescribed to them, and that I don't know what\
  \ affect it will have on him.  She got upset with me, saying that she's a provider\
  \ and knows what she's doing.  I told her that prescribing your own child is a conflict\
  \ of interest medically, that no one should take drugs not prescribed to them, and\
  \ that I would prefer that if we're going to give a seven-year-old anything, it\
  \ go through the proper channel of doctor-prescription-pharmacy-parent.  \n\nShe\
  \ got really upset with me.  Saying she would never hurt our kid, she knows what\
  \ she is doing, etc.  She was hurt because she felt like I had insulted her ability\
  \ as a medical professional.  I told her that I don't doubt that at all (I don't),\
  \ but that I don't agree with the process.  I asked her how she would feel if she\
  \ came home from work and the babysitter told her she had given the kid a half a\
  \ Xanax to calm him down.  She said that was different, as the babysitter is not\
  \ a medical pro.  I said it's not different, it's someone giving a child a drug\
  \ they're not prescribed.  So now she stormed out and won't talk to me.  AITA here?"
