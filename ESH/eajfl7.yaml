selftext: 'Last night some friends of mine were in town. We were just hanging out
  at my place and playing board games so we ordered some dominos around 10 pm. The
  pizza ended up being pretty late. I went out to get it, but my friend had paid with
  her card. I asked her to sign, because I didn''t want to add a tip on her card.
  She said to just go ahead, so I signed but didn''t add a tip. I grabbed the pizza
  and told the guy to have a nice night. He seemed like he was waiting for cash, but
  I didn''t have any, so I couldn''t have tipped him that way anyway. (Normally i
  would just tip through the app when i made the purchase, but I didnt do the ordering)
  When I went back in, we heard him cursing us out and slamming his doors and then
  he drove by and screamed again. I know tipping is typically expected, but Idk if
  delivery people are living off of those tips the way servers are. (We are in the
  US) The friend who paid put in a complaint through the app and is thinking about
  calling the store in the morning, because this was an extreme reaction and lead
  to us feeling pretty unsafe for the rest of the night. We are all women in our 20s
  and I live by myself. So, in this situation, were we the AH?


  TLDR: We didn''t tip for delivery and the guy got very angry. AITA'
