selftext: "My house overlooks a public footpath. It\u2019s a shortcut between two\
  \ estates which to drive it a 1.5 mile journey, walking 0.5 miles. \n\nAn idiot,\
  \ on a dirt bike, no helmet... presuming no insurance, likes to use it as a short\
  \ cut. It\u2019s a route used by kids, adults, cyclists, horseriders... and this\
  \ guy is a massive inconvenience to everyone. \n\nSo... would I be the arsehole\
  \ if I sprayed water at him as he passed? Preferably laced with food dye?\n\nEdit\
  \ for info:\n\nThis has been reported to the police. Nothing gets done as he\u2019\
  s gone so quickly and there\u2019s not a regular time he goes past. Once he\u2019\
  s off the estate, he\u2019s on farmland and cycle paths. \nEveryone who lives around\
  \ us are sick of him \nHe covers his number plate \nHe\u2019s nearly run over kids\
  \ and dogs."
