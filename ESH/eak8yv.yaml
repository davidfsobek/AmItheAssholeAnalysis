selftext: "Background: \n\nI am a captain working on upgrading my license to advance\
  \ my career, this involves working 28 days on and having 2 weeks off. Lately I've\
  \ come home to a mess. Yes, I know she isn't totally lazy as things are somewhat\
  \ organized, but without me being home to constantly direct her like my previous\
  \ jobs, nothing gets 100 percent complete. For example, she let let the i-robot\
  \ run right before my return to pick up all the surface dog hair, but she will not\
  \ clean off all the dog hair on the couch and under it, which stinks to high heaven.\
  \ Another example, I came home to a very foul smell in the washer and clothes piled\
  \ up all over the house, some dirty, some clean, but hard to tell the difference\
  \ and some even mixed, like she forgot where the clean pile was.  Apparently she\
  \ did a load of cloths, but left them in the washer for about a week, causing mold\
  \ to develope in the washer. I've even started washing my clothes before coming\
  \ home from my hitch because I know there's at least four loads of laundry that\
  \ need to be done before I can even see the washer to do my own clothes.\n\nNow\
  \ I have called her, tried to encourage her to complete tasks, that's it's good\
  \ for her mental health to completely finish a task before moving on to the next\
  \ one, and to keep up with what I've cleaned up on my time off. But after my next\
  \ 28 days, we're back to step one. \n\nI knew she was overwhelmed trying to maintain\
  \ the house, so I offered to hire a cleaning service to assist her. She refused\
  \ it. \n\nI offered a cleaning schedule spreadsheet she could use as a reference\
  \ to maintain the daily cleaning tasks so that she would not let everything build\
  \ up to the last minute and have extra anxiety and pressure to clean everything\
  \ right before I return home.\n\nso this is what's caused a ruffle in our relationship,\
  \ she thinks  I am a clean freak when I come home because everything is disorganized\
  \ there's clutter all over the counters, when in reality I like my house like I\
  \ keep my vessel.  When customs walk on- board my international vessel they immediately\
  \ know all my paperwork is in order everything is good we're not hiding anything\
  \ because it is a clean organized vessel. I've always maintained that level thought\
  \ throughout my life. \n\nYes, I know I set the bar high. but if she listen to what\
  \ I suggested instead of blowing everything off I don't think we would be in this\
  \ situation. I've told her that she has plenty of time, it's just the way she prioritize\
  \  it that I have an issue with. she would much rather just sit around and play\
  \ fortnite versus take a little time each day and clean up the house. It's to the\
  \ point where I want to do a separation for a couple months I can work straight\
  \ time on the boat, and let her realize what I'm trying to teach her is beneficial\
  \ instead of doing everything for her.\n\n\nWe live in a one bedroom apartment,\
  \ not a huge house. \n\n\nAITA?"
