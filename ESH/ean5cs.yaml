selftext: "Sister asked me to watch her kids 6, and 4, while she goes Christmas shopping.\
  \ I told her that\u2019s fine as long as they can be quiet because my friend is\
  \ staying with me, and she didn\u2019t get home til 630am (partying) and will be\
  \ sleeping all day. \n\nMy sister became irritated and acted like I should be so\
  \ annoyed with my friend. I really don\u2019t care, it\u2019s not inconveniencing\
  \ me at all.. I just simply asked that my sister tell her kids to try to keep it\
  \ down. \n\nI asked one of my other friends what she thought and she said she would\
  \ also be irritated with me for asking her kids to be quiet. \n\nMakes zero sense\
  \ to me. AITA??? \n\nSome Things to know-I\u2019m  watching kids for free and only\
  \ for 1 hour. \n\nMy sister and I are both not party people at all. My friend is\
  \ recently divorced and staying with me for just a week."
