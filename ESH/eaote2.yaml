selftext: "So I went to Waffle House today, which is one of the trashier places to\
  \ get in a fight with someone.  I'm disabled and have a handicapped placard.  There\
  \ were two handicap spots.  One of them was unusable because the driver parked her\
  \ tiny Honda about 6 inches over the line, which left no room to use that spot without\
  \ parking somewhat in the wheelchair unloading area.  We used the other spot.\n\n\
  As we're getting out the lady walks inside, yapping on her phone the whole way.\
  \  When we go in the guy at the counter is trying to take her order as she keeps\
  \ talking on the phone and speaking to him sporadically.\n\nI walk up and tell her\
  \ in a calm voice \"You parked across the line in the handicapped spot.\"  \n\n\
  She goes \"It's no big deal.\"  \n\nI said \"Yes it is.\"  \n\nShe goes \"Well actually\
  \ I'm handicapped so I can use the spot.\"\n\nI told her to get a placard then and\
  \ use the spot.  I and my family walked off to a table to sit down.  She starts\
  \ loudly bitching about how I need to mind my own business and shut my mouth.\n\n\
  I flipped her off.  She went absolutely apeshit.  She ended up screaming threats\
  \ at us.  All 3 of us ended up screaming at her after she threatened my daughter.\
  \  The poor Waffle House employees had to get between us.  It was a complete shit\
  \ show.\n\nAITA?  I don't think I am for initially just calmly pointing out that\
  \ she effectively blocked the handicap spot, but the situation definitely escalated\
  \ when I gave her the finger."
