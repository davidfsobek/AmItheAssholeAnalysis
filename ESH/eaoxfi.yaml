selftext: "Edit 2: We actually talked and everything is good, but it looks like most\
  \ of the people are ruling YTA. I kind of thought that since it was an accident\
  \ and I had tried to be as upfront and apologetic as possible I\u2019d get some\
  \ leeway, but I will accept my asshole fate. I appreciate the input. \n\nSome background,\
  \ my roommate (32M) and I (30M) have lived together for 3 years and have been friends\
  \ for around 12 years. I am a prolific user of Amazon Prime, my roommate not so\
  \ much. In the 3 years we have lived together something similar has happened 1 other\
  \ time.\n\nAs the holidays are coming up I had ordered a some gifts for friends\
  \ and family that were set to be delivered between yesterday and today. Yesterday\
  \ three packages were delivered and were all stacked together. I opened the first\
  \ two, which were mine and then the third I realized was his as soon as I cut the\
  \ box open, so I put it in the living room for him. I brought in a few other packages\
  \ of his this morning and when he got up said something to the effect of \"I brought\
  \ in some of your packages, sorry I accidentally opened one yest..\" at which point\
  \ he just shut the door. He went about his day stomping around a bit and then left\
  \ never acknowledging I had said anything. Maybe an hour later he left and I texted\
  \ him and apologized saying I assumed it was mine.\n\nAs I mentioned above, pretty\
  \ much the exact same thing happened like a year ago and he was very angry and it\
  \ turned into a big deal. I can already tell it's going to happen again. This whole\
  \ thing just seems very silly to me. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I fully admit I\
  \ wasn't paying attention. It was very much an honest mistake, I got home from work\
  \ and just brought in our packages. I have tried to apologize twice, so I clearly\
  \ know I am in the wrong for opening it."
