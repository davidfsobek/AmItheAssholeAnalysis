selftext: 'It''s a little after 4AM where I am right now. I drive for a company you''ve
  heard of (won''t say which) where you can hail a car via an app. I showed up to
  a home address where clearly a house party was going on. It was like something you
  see in the movies. A girl who I''m 99% sure was 17-18 gets loaded into the back
  of my car by her friends, they give me her home address and some instructions: She''s
  underage (under 21) so don''t draw undue attention. Pull all the way down her parents
  driveway, to behind her house and put her in her basement via the steps as it is
  a fully furnished basement. Her brother "should be there" to receive her but they
  couldn''t get him on the phone. Anyway, she is borderline babbling/blacking out
  the 35 min ride and I pull up to her house. Lights are on inside, although the driveway
  and back is dark. I "could have" driven in and tried to haul her in. I was sketched
  out, so I pulled up to the curb, physically took her out and started carrying/pulling
  her to her front door. She was almost impossible to move. Short/totally average
  build, definitely less than 150 pounds, but she was dead weigh and kept shifting.
  I got 3/4 across her lawn and my nerves gave out. I left her there and took off.
  She was crawling/stumbling towards the house when I left. I actually feel like a
  big asshole right now. What do you think?'
