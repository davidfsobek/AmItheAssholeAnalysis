selftext: "We have two children; a boy (Jay) and a girl (Leah). These are obviously\
  \ not their real names. Jay is 12 and Leah is 15. So, let me start this off by saying\
  \ that me and my wife live a very comfortable life. Basically, we've worked hard\
  \ our entire lives and got promoted till we got to this point where we make enough\
  \ money to support a \"lavish\" lifestyle. I'm merely mentioning this because I\
  \ believe that this fact is the core of our problem.\n\nWhat I mean by that is that\
  \ our income is giving some leeway for their mom to break their stuff. She often\
  \ breaks their stuff when they misbehave, spend too much time on them or get bad\
  \ grades. Now I believe that there should be some sort of punishment for when these\
  \ stuff happen. Taking their stuff away for a while would be an okay punishment.\
  \ However, breaking their stuff is extreme and wasteful. Moreover, when I say their\
  \ stuff, I'm talking about Leah's phone (which costed a hair over $1000) and Jay's\
  \ latest gaming console.\n\nLately, Jay and Leah have been doing a lot of things\
  \ that irked their mother. So, yesterday their mother had reached her boiling point\
  \ and she smashed Leah's phone by throwing it full force at the floor, and she cut\
  \ Jay's PS4 cords. I suppose that Jay's predicament was far better than that of\
  \ his sister, mostly since their mom didn't know how to break a PS4.\n\nI was out\
  \ when she'd done all that. My kids told me once I arrived. I was annoyed. However,\
  \ I stood by their mother's side and basically defended her actions. Once we were\
  \ alone, I told her that she should stop breaking stuff. \n\nShe said that they\
  \ deserve it and should start listening to her if they want to keep their stuff.\
  \ I told her that she could've just taken them and hidden them somewhere. She said\
  \ she didn't want them to have hope of having it back anytime soon. Basically we've\
  \ argued on and on for an hour or so and haven't reached any compromise yet.\n\n\
  Their mom does this about twice a year, and she ends up buying them their stuff\
  \ back when they've fixed their act. It's also fair to mention that these outbursts\
  \ are unplanned. She just loses it and breaks their stuff. She does have anger issues\
  \ but never with me."
