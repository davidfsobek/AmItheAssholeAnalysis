selftext: "Let me preface this by saying me and this coworker have been friends for\
  \ the past five years. He has a weird sense of humor and I\u2019m the guy to take\
  \ it, laugh it off and not be easily offended by his jokes. \n\nI work at a hospital\
  \ and we\u2019re in our consult room typing up notes. We have about five other people\
  \ in there. Anyway, my coworker, \u201CLarry\u201D, has been coming in an hour after\
  \ me and has recently been saying \u201CHow\u2019s the bombing department going?\u201D\
  \ Or \u201Chow\u2019s it going terrorist?\u201D when he comes in and sits next to\
  \ me. This has been going on for the past 2-3 years now. I know he doesn\u2019t\
  \ have any malicious intent because he says he\u2019s glad how I can take jokes\
  \ well (since people have reported others to HR for stuff they\u2019ve said). \n\
  \nHe says these things because of my complexion (obviously) and my facial hair.\
  \ So I\u2019ve been taking it and laughing it off these past few years but it doesn\u2019\
  t really bother me except kind of embarrass me in front of the others when they\
  \ are around. So recently when he greeted me with his favorite saying, I laughed\
  \ and replied with \u201Chow\u2019s it going you fatass?!\u201D \n\nHe\u2019s an\
  \ obese, old, white guy who\u2019s about 350 lbs more or less and he took it well,\
  \ but was surprised I retaliated. During my break when he stepped out of the room,\
  \ another coworker said I crossed the line and shouldn\u2019t have said that to\
  \ him. I replied back by saying \u201Che calls me a terrorist, why can\u2019t I\
  \ call him a fatass?\u201D He and another reply saying he\u2019s actually fat while\
  \ I\u2019m not a terrorist? I just scoffed and although I felt bad, I didn\u2019\
  t care. \n\nCan I keep calling him a fat ass whenever he calls me a terrorist? It\u2019\
  s obviously unprofessional behavior in a healthcare setting and I could take him\
  \ to HR if I wanted to, but I don\u2019t really care that much as long as I can\
  \ call him a fatass or something offensive myself.\n\nEdit:\n\nSeems like I\u2019\
  m an asshole and should just take it up to HR. It\u2019ll be awkward but I have\
  \ about 10+ voice recordings of him saying it just in case it got to that point.\
  \ I\u2019ll talk to him first and hopefully he won\u2019t think I\u2019m playing\
  \ around this time and will stop. If not I\u2019ll take it up with HR. Thanks"
