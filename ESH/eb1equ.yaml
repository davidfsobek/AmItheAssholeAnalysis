selftext: "Or, rather, is my SO the asshole.\n\n\nWe made a run to the Post Office\
  \ to send out Christmas gifts for my family. My SO dropped me at the door and I\
  \ went in with the packages to get in line. When I walked in, there were about 50\
  \ people in line ahead of me. Within the first few minutes of waiting, another two\
  \ or three got in line behind me. As I was standing there an older woman (approx\
  \ early 60s in age) walked in the door and cut in line in front of us. An elderly\
  \ gentleman behind me and I quietly laughed together about her skipping the line\
  \ but neither of us said anything, since there were only a few of us behind her.\
  \ Just after that my SO joined us in line. The line behind us quickly grew to around\
  \ 50 people and the lobby quickly became quite crowded. At this point a young Mother\
  \ came in with her two children. The woman in front of me who had already cut ahead\
  \ of me in line told the woman to go ahead of her saying \u201Cyou and your children\
  \ have much better things to do than wait in line!\u201D. \n\nI was pretty dumbfounded\
  \ by her allowing the woman to jump the ahead of 50 people, and the others around\
  \ me seemed to be as well, I might have actually said something but before I could\
  \ I heard my SO from behind me:\n\n\n\u201CAnd what the fresh HELL is THIS? So...\
  \ she doesn\u2019t have to wait in line because she has kids? Who are YOU to decide\
  \ who gets to go ahead of you? There are other people waiting patiently back here?!\
  \ I guess I should have grabbed some crotch goblins on my way in!\u201D\n\n\nThe\
  \ old woman said \u201CIt\u2019s Christmas!\u201D\n\n\nAnother gentleman in line\
  \ told her that it wasn\u2019t her place to decide how the rest of us should spend\
  \ our time. Still others were a mix of aggressively nodding their heads in agreement\
  \ while some glared at my SO like he was Satan incarnate. A postal employee made\
  \ the young Mother go to the end of the line.\n\nAs we continued to wait in line\
  \ she me made a comment about how rude my SO was. I kind of lost my shit. I told\
  \ her that she had cut in line in front of me to begin with and I guess she assumes\
  \ that because she\u2019s the most important person in the building, the line ends\
  \ where she begins and the rest of dont matter.\n\nThe lady then flagged down a\
  \ Postal worker and asked him to take her packages from her so she wouldn\u2019\
  t have to wait in line as she was frightened of us. The Postal worker told her no.\
  \ \n\nAfter we got in the car to leave, my SO started to regret his actions a bit\
  \ and felt like an asshole. I told him no- He was just the only one of us not willing\
  \ to suffer in silence. \nHe\u2019s a Veteran, with PTSD and because of this questions\
  \ his own reactions at times. He asked me to post this as he\u2019s still on the\
  \ fence about his own behavior. Frankly, I think he was in the right.\nSo what is\
  \ it... Is he the asshole? Am I? Was she? Were we all assholes, just a bit, in the\
  \ true spirit of Christmas?"
