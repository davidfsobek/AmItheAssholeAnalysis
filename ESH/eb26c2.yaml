selftext: 'Helle reddit!


  Been lurking this subreddit for some time, and now I''ve decided to post. First,
  sorry if any mistakes, English is not my first language.

  So, I(25F) am getting quite frustrated at my partner(26M) quite often these days
  and I wonder if I''m the one overreacting..


  We''ve been together for 10 months, and have been living together pretty much since
  may, I believe. May or june. When we first got together I was working as a teacher
  2 full days a week and otherwise studying to get my teaching degree. This meant
  that I was away from my apartment 4-5 days a week. I say my apartment, because I''ve
  been living here for 6 years. My boyfriend was living at home when we got together,
  so it was quite natural for us to spend time at my place. I made it quite clear
  for my boyfriend that I NEED my space - which means him LEAVING the apartment every
  now and then, preferable 3-5 days a week for some hours.


  He did not have a job when we got together. He had some savings he would live of.
  Him not having a job meant that he would not respect my wish to have my alone-time
  in my own little space. I live in a 50m2 apartment, so it''s not that big for 2
  persons, but it''s okay. I would have to feel like I was about to explode every
  time he would finally leave me alone for some hours - when going away, he would
  visit his parents(they live 40mins drive from here), and usually make me feel bad
  about having this need to be alone.


  Anyways, my mom passed away 1st of july this summer and afterwards some major selfreflecting
  happened to me and I quit my job and my study, last work day in october, currently
  living of my own savings and planning to start looking for a job after christmas.
  My BF finally realized he was about to run out of money november, so he started
  looking for a job and starts a fulltime job january.


  I feel so cramped. So frustrated. And so annoyed at almost everything he says or
  does - I don''t get why the hell he doesnt let me be alone in the apartment more
  often? AITA for wanting to be alone?? I know we now share this place, but he has
  literally told me that he wants ME the leave the apartment so HE can have alone
  time!!! I mean, dude, really. I feel like this issue with me not having my time
  to myself reflects my affection towards him - not many people want to be loving,
  when they feel like any moment they can explode. And yes, we have talked about this
  several times before. It usually ends with him saying he will leave more often,
  but never does and him also saying that I could just leave the apartment and get
  my alone time away from home..

  So reddit, what do you think? What should and can I do? How on earth do I get more
  alone time(or at least, the illusion of it)? Thank you for reading!

  Edit: Forgot to mention, as I did in my comment below, that I DO leave the apartment
  several(4-6/week) times a week for 1-2 hours at the time to go for a walk, to the
  gym or piano lessons or whatever.'
