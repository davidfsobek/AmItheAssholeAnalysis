selftext: 'I (F15) expressed to my grandmother how I wanted a barbell so I could do
  weighted squats and get some muscle onto my chicken legs (lol) and shown her an
  ideal image of my desired body (a toned woman, hourglass figure)


  Grandma was disgusted by this muscly lady, saying she wasn''t "feminine", and my
  morbidly obese sister (F27) agreed with her. My sister wasn''t always fat, but all
  of a sudden became defensive of her weight when she gained after giving birth. I''ve
  always been high energy so I exercise to stop being so hyper and to focus. My sister
  all of a sudden when gaining weight started to shame me for being so adamant on
  my running and lifting. She accused me of being addicted to exercise. I knew this
  was a coping mechanism for her being a lard ass, so I just put it off for a few
  months and didn''t say anything when she tried to shame me. She also says dumb shit
  like "Curvy is in right now!"


  Today was the breaking point. She said I was just trying to "be rebellious" and
  that being toned wasn''t feminine, I was addicted to exercise, etc. Of course this
  pissed me off so I said "You''re just jealous because you''re a fatass."


  Sister freaked out, my grandma said it was an asshole thing to say, and that I shouldn''t
  say it again.


  Sister literally thinks I am Satan right now. Mom thinks I went too far, grandma
  is amused, etc.


  TL;DR Sister shames me for my exercise, she''s insecure about her weight and I call
  her a fatass to teach her a lesson, she freaks out.'
