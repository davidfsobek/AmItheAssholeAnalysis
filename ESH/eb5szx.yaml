selftext: "We celebrate Christmas early with my side of the family because there are\
  \ so many of us that it\u2019s hard to get together on Christmas. \n\n\nWe have\
  \ an itinerary for the day\u2014 pray, eat, take family pictures,  listen to the\
  \ story of Jesus/nativity scene, open presents.\n\n\nMy son is 11 and we\u2019ve\
  \ been dealing with a lot to behavior problems. He\u2019s on restriction right now\
  \ from all electronics because of his behavior.\n\n\nWhen it came time to pray,\
  \ he refused to close his eyes and said \u201Cthis is dumb, who cares\u201D and\
  \ proceeded to eat while my uncle was doing the prayer. I took him to another room\
  \ and we had a talk about his behavior and what I expected the rest of the night.\
  \ \n\n\nFamily picture time came and he said he didn\u2019t want to be in it. I\
  \ told him it wasn\u2019t an option but he kept trying to sneak away. When I finally\
  \ got him to stand in the pictures, he would try to hide so we couldn\u2019t see\
  \ him in it. \n\n\n\nThen the story came and I had enough. All the little kids were\
  \ sitting around as my aunt told the story and he kept making remarks like \u201C\
  Jesus isn\u2019t real\u201D \u201Cthat didn\u2019t actually happen\u201D \u201C\
  Jesus was gay\u201D. \n\n\nAgain, I pulled him to a side room and told him that\
  \ his behavior was unacceptable and he won\u2019t be opening his presents because\
  \ of it. He threw a fit and said some nasty things towards me so I told him he\u2019\
  s to stay in that room until it\u2019s time to leave.\n\n\n\nPeople started asking\
  \ where he was and I told them he needs to be alone right now. My mom said she\u2019\
  d go talk to him and I told her no, he\u2019s in there because I said he can\u2019\
  t come out due to his behavior. She said he at least needs to be there for presents\
  \ and I said no, he can open them later when he earns them back. \n\n\n\nAll the\
  \ old ladies had a fit when they found out I wasn\u2019t letting him participate.\
  \ Someone said \u201Cremember when we could have a nice Christmas together without\
  \ locking our kids in a bedroom all night?\u201D \n\n\nI just ignored it and I do\
  \ think I handled it correctly. He ended up apologizing to me and my aunt and uncle(the\
  \ ones he interrupted).\n\n\nEdit post: I do not force him to be religious. I am\
  \ not religious myself. I told him he didn\u2019t have to participate but he needs\
  \ to be respectful. I wasn\u2019t punishing him for not believing in god, I was\
  \ punishing him for being disrespectful about it."
