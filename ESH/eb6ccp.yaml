selftext: 'Backstory:We both drive and had a system where we each have a day with
  the car cause we share one, I get it ever monday, wednesday and friday and she gets
  it tuesday, thursday and saturday while sunday is first come first serve. We have
  used this for a little over a year now.


  My sister asked me if she could use the car on sunday cause she wanted to go hang
  out with her friends. The catch is all her friends can drive, I wanted to use the
  car too cause I wanted to go visit my friends the thing is her friends can drive
  while my friend doesn''t have his license yet. I tried to compromise that I get
  it from 8-12 and she can use it for the rest of the day. She didn''t like that and
  wanted it for the WHOLE day even tho she wouldn''t be using it till 11:30 and its
  not like she had anything scheduled that she needed the car by 11:30 anyways. So
  today I woke up early (around 7ish) and took the keys to leave, I came back at 12
  at the dot cause I didn''t want her to wait super long. When I got home she was
  pissed (kinda saw that coming) she called me an asshole and how we didn''t agree
  to that, I said "the agreement was that its first come first serve. I compromised
  and I held my deal of the bargain". She just shook her head and got into the car.


  This happened last week and she''s been all pissy with me this whole week saying
  how I "can''t be trusted" and how I''m "a dirtbag for going against my word". I
  am over this whole thing but I''m curious what others think AITA?


  REPOST CAUSE I HAD MISSING INFO AND ASKED WRONG QUESTION'
