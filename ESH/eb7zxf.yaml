selftext: "Me and some friends were playing DND and decided to take a break and get\
  \ something to eat there were 5 of us and we decided to go to taco Bell\n\nSaid\
  \ friend decides to not wear shoes even though he knows we're going to eat. I guess\
  \ he thought we were going to the drive through but again there were 5 of us so\
  \ we didn't want to make different orders so we decided to go in. He obviously didn't\
  \ want to go in bc he was not wearing shoes so he stayed in the car while we went\
  \ in.\nAfter we got our food and came back to the car we messed around for a bit\
  \ and left during this time he literally said not a single word. When we got back\
  \ to the house he would still not speak\n\nTurned out he was really pissed now he's\
  \ telling all our friends we made him go hungry and just generally being really\
  \ angry\n\n AITA for not asking if he wanted to go to the drive through after getting\
  \ back in the car"
