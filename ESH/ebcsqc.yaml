selftext: 'For context, I am 23M my gf is 22F, we have been together for 3 months.


  This weekend I met her parents for the first time. When she introduced me to her
  dad he said his name was Bob but I should call him Mr.Lastname. Assuming this was
  a joke, I chuckled and said only if he calls me Dr.Lastname in 4 years, (I am in
  med school which he knew ahead of time). He responded basically saying, he will
  not be doing that and he is serious, he is adamant on being called Mr.Lastname.
  Not wanting to cause a scene I chuckled and walked away.


  Rest of the night, I tried to avoid talking too him too much (I still talked to
  her mom I was not silent all night) and i called him his firstname several times
  but never Mr.Lastname. The first time I called him his first name he corrected me
  to Mr.Lastname but after that he did not correct me again but he was visibly upset.
  Besides this, I think everything went well.


  After dinner my girlfriend left with me and we talked about this. She said that
  she gets why i didnt want to call him Mr.Lastname but I should have, just to make
  him happy. I said that I am not 16 anymore and it was an asinine request. She is
  sort of upset with me (unfairly imo) but what annoys me is that she is not upset
  with her dad even though I think it was his fault for ruining the mood.


  This was Friday night and I have got mixed opinions from different people, so in
  your opinions AITA? And since this started a debate with my friends, at what age
  is calling your significant others parents Mr and Mrs no longer necessary assuming
  they want you to. (I think 18)


  Edit 1: This really blew up and I did not expect it to. A few things, if he introduced
  himself as Mr.Lastname I probably would have called him that but he didnt. He said
  his name was Bob, but I have to call him Mr.Lastname. To me that is him just trying
  to establish dominance over me. Additionally, not really sure how I came off as
  arrogant. I was making a joke, about him having to call me Dr once I graduate. Lastly,
  the mom told me to call her by her name which only made him being insistent on Mr.Lastname
  more weird.'
