selftext: 'My wife started a side business a while back selling custom cookies, you  know
  those cute little decorated things for parties and stuff. Well it was a big investment
  upfront buying equipment and I converted our whole dining room so she can have space
  to do cookies and usually takes over the whole kitchen too. But that''s another
  thing...

  Anyway she''s gotten really good at it and has a lot of business and subsequently
  has been making pretty good money. She has about $800 now in a checking account,
  and if she needs supplies and stuff she takes it out of there. But what started
  as a small thing is growing. After work so goes straight to doing cookies almost
  everyday. And she says it''s her money to do what she wants, she earned it. We have
  a joint account and share everything, but recently we have been fighting about money
  a lot. I set a monthly spending account for both of us of $450 a month for us to
  spend on whatever, but she complains its always empty. Though its mainly her spending
  the money.

  So recently we decided to split the spending account so we can each spend guilt
  free and one doesn''t spend the "others share". Now for 6 years I''ve had a Qapital
  account, which is an app that takes a set amount out each month and saves it. I''ve
  used it as a savings type account for stuff I want to buy, I put $20 a month in
  it.

  So after splitting our accounts she got mad I had the Qapital account and asked
  to close it. I did, and put the money in my account(its $235 I''ve saved all year)
  Now she is pissed that I have the money in my account and not split it. And then
  well I asked that she put her cookie earnings into our joint account. And she refuses.

  Am I the asshole?'
