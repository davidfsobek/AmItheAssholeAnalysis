  \ \n\nI have a lot of tattoos. My most recent tattoo is a tattoo that I designed\
  \ with my husband. We got matching ones for our anniversary. It is super personal.\
  \ \n\nAs I was showing it off to my friends, I notice one girl in our group (who\
  \ I\u2019m not super close to) was really into it. She even took a picture of it\
  \ which I thought was strange but I let it slide. \nLet\u2019s call this girl Sarah.\
  \ \n\nSarah does not  have any tattoos that I know of, if she does they are really\
  \ small and in unnoticed places. So a week or so later I hear through the grape\
  \ vine that Sarah is trying to get a copy of my tattoo. honestly I suspected this.\
  \ She told a couple of friends of mine the design, and for some reason, didn\u2019\
  t think that they would tell me. But here comes the crazy part, she comes to me\
  \ and asks me for a recommendation for an artist. She specifically wanted one that\
  \ wasn\u2019t too expensive.\n\nI asked her what she was going to get. She was really\
  \ coy with me and told me that she had not finished thinking about it yet. So I\
  \ recommend the worst tattoo \u201Cartist\u201D I know, let\u2019s call him Bubba.\
  \ I\u2019ve gotten two \u201Cjoke\u201D tattoos from Bubba, one is terrible and\
  \ blown out ,but it\u2019s okay because it\u2019s that duck or rabbit optical illusion.\
  \ The other one I have had covered up. He works at subway during the day and gives\
  \ tattoos from his garage. \n\nI knew she wouldn\u2019t do her proper research and\
  \ check him out, and she didn\u2019t. She went and got her cheap tattoo from Bubba,\
  \ and it is *fucked. up* It\u2019s already blown out, the lines aren\u2019t straight,\
  \  and may be infected.  My husband and I are howling about this, but a few friends\
  \ of mine think what I did was really messed up. She\u2019ll be ok, she\u2019ll\
  \ just have a really really shitty version of my tattoo. I think it\u2019s what\
  \ she deserves. So let me know reddit, AITA?"
