selftext: "Let\u2019s call my 12 year old daughter, hmm, Angie. Angie is super athletic\
  \ and loves exercising and soccer notably. \n\nNaturally, her favorite class is\
  \ P.E. Her actual P.E. teacher is a really nice dude. At my daughters school, P.E.\
  \ is ran by three teachers at once with every student, even though each student\
  \ technically has only of those teachers, if that makes sense. One of the teachers,\
  \ let\u2019s call her Miss Johnson, is strongly disliked by my daughter. My daughter\
  \ will chat with her friends during P.E. (nothing distruptive, not when teachers\
  \ are instructing just during activity) and Miss Johnson will yell at my daughter\
  \ that this is an outdoor classroom and it won\u2019t be tolerated. They make her\
  \ run extra laps.\n\nIn her extended homeroom last Tuesday, they had to write letters\
  \ to staff members they\u2019re grateful for. She wrote one to her English teacher\
  \ and the other to you guessed it, Miss Johnson. The note reads:\n\n\u201CDear Miss\
  \ Johnson,\n\nYou are my favorite teacher. Well, you\u2019re not technically my\
  \ teacher, but you definitely act like it. I really love when you yell at me for\
  \ speaking in your outdoor classroom. I will most definitely strive to do better\
  \ in your wonderful class. I appreciate when I have to run extra laps, I love running\
  \ actually. Overall, you\u2019re my favorite teacher and I totally look forward\
  \ to your class everyday.\nKindest Regards, \nAngie\u201D\n\nWednesday afternoon\
  \ I got a call from the school stating that she did that and an email with the letter\
  \ in it. I\u2019m not that mad, it was technically not unkind. She didn\u2019t say\
  \ anything hurtful, and she\u2019s 12. They gave her a detention where she had to\
  \ write an apology to Miss Johnson. She eventually did it, although reluctant because\
  \ she just wanted to leave.\n\nAITA for not punishing her/even being mad?"
