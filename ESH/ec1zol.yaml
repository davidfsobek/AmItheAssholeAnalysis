selftext: 'My brother left his house recently because he''s been fighting with his
  wife because he''s coming home at 4am every night going to some "club".


  He''s been staying at my families house and my pregnant niece started talking to
  me about it. She said him and her mom have been arguing a lot lately and that he
  planned on going on a weekend trip with another woman. (Keep in mind he''s cheated
  in the past.)


  The other day, he brought that woman back to my house and admitted to staying over
  at hers a few times. I let my niece know about it. Hours later my niece showed up
  at my families house and argued with my mom questioning her about the woman he brought
  over. My mom decided to lie and say he didn''t bring over a woman. Which my niece
  knew wasnt true because I had photo evidence.


  Since then my mom has insulted in extremely disgusting ways toward both me and my
  niece and is attempting to make the whole extended family hate us. All because we
  discussed him cheating on his wife and leaving his son and pregnant daughter.'
title: AITA for discussing with my niece (who's a year younger than me) about my brother
  (her dad) cheating on his wife?
