selftext: "My husband and I are in our 30's and we have three kids. We're absolutely\
  \ done having kids and he had a vasectomy two years ago. My parents-in-law have\
  \ a history of not keeping things private. For example, my husband confided in his\
  \ dad a few years ago that he had a lump in the testicles. It turned out to be a\
  \ harmless cyst but the news made its way to my mother-in-law, sister-in-law and\
  \ her husband. My mother-in-law kept asking my husband for updates on his testicles\
  \ and how they felt. The whole experience felt very yuck to me and it certainly\
  \ made my husband uncomfortable.\n\nWe had mentioned about our plans for a vasectomy\
  \ years ago and my mother-in-law started asking about when he'd have it and and\
  \ that she wants to be there for him after the vasectomy and wants to know updates\
  \ on his healing and his health. I really got put off about my mother-in-law wanting\
  \ to know about the health and especially since she seemed \"concerned\" about our\
  \ choice. \n\nMy mother-in-law keeps asking us from time to time about when husband\
  \ is going to have vasectomy. He already had it. Two years ago. It went great. Very\
  \ little pain and he was back at work next day (desk job). I took care of the kids\
  \ and made sure he wasn't lifting anything heavy he was  healing. He's great. \n\
  \nMy husband now feels bad about lying every time mother-in-law asks about the vasectomy.\
  \ The thing is.. I don't want people to know about our family planning choices,\
  \ or to pass judgement. No matter how many times we've asked for details not to\
  \ be shared, they always not respect it and this time won't be different.  I don't\
  \ want mother-in-law to ooze with concern about my husband's testicles. so, AITA\
  \ for wanting to shut it down with a simple no?"
