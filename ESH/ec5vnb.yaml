selftext: 'So I am fifteen years old and female, for a bit of context, my dad packed
  up and left my mom with me in tow when I was five. I grew a strong relationship
  with my dad and it''s great, I love my dad. Now onto what''s bugging me. My dad
  recently started dating again and his girlfriend is pregnant. I was on the phone
  with my boyfriend when he told me and my boyfriend heard me lose my absolute shit.
  I was angry so I asked if this child was keeping their mom, before you say anything,
  I was not thinking at the time. He gave me a look that said yes they were and then
  he left. His girlfriend and I do not have any common interest and treats me like
  a pest most of the time. I told my dad this and he said that it will be fine and
  I''ll get used to her, no I won''t but okay dad. I want someone who cares for me,
  who says everything will be fine when it''s not fine, I want my mommy to be quite
  honest. I guess my dad told his girlfriend this and she was PISSED. She started
  yelling that I was an "ungrateful little bitch" who "cries for the attention not
  the hurt." Bitch you threw a candle at my shoulder the other night cause I got you
  ice cream without peanuts. The only person who acts like they give a shit about
  me is my boyfriend and he''s saying that it''s normal to try and adjust and be upset.
  I was upset and I trashed a pillow she got me, on accident, I was punching it and
  then I started tearing it and I started getting more violent with it. I told him
  this and he thought it was the funniest shit ever.


  I just want to know if I should try and give her another chance or if I should just
  give up. AITA for not wanting anything to do with her and my half-sibling? AITA
  for trashing the pillow? I need answers. (This was updated since my op got removed)


  Edit: She just told me to break up with my boyfriend, apparently, he''s too "cute
  and charming" to be seen with "dirt" like me, this is what I deal with on the way
  to school every morning.'
