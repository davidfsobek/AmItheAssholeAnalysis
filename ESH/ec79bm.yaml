selftext: "My ex and I have been divorced for 10 years. Together, we have a 16 year\
  \ old. We get along great and coparent well, we have 50/50 custody. My current wife\
  \ and I do have more money than my ex. (I do pay child support) In the past, we\
  \ have been able to give him bigger Christmases and birthdays, but we always make\
  \ it clear to him that his mom is amazing and he should be grateful for everything\
  \ she gives him. In the past, she\u2019s said nothing about this.\n\nMy son has\
  \ his learner\u2019s permit, with hopes to get his license by spring. He\u2019s\
  \ been using the three of our cars\u2019 to learn. My wife and I discussed his big\
  \ Christmas gift this year being a used car, that he can finish his practice with.\
  \ He\u2019ll have rules and such. We ended up finding a reliable car checked over\
  \ by a mechanic.\n\nI told my ex, not knowing her plans for his gift. She got upset\
  \ and said I should sell the car, that she couldn\u2019t match such a gift and it\
  \ wasn\u2019t fair to her. I said it was more about our kid. I even offered to say\
  \ it was from all of us, but she said he\u2019d know she couldn\u2019t afford it.\
  \ I wasn\u2019t sure what to say, but ultimately felt it was no different than past\
  \ christmases. \n\nMy wife is unsure now. She wonders if we\u2019re making things\
  \ worse. Am I the ass here?"

  \ me to?"
