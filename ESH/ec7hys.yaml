selftext: "TL;DR on bottom\n\n  As transparent as I can:\n\n   When we met ,   I was\
  \ waiting for VA, CRSC and Disability to kick on I had got myself in debt.   100%\
  \ disabled/covered  but they left me with numerous medical bills. Leaving me with\
  \ what I call 'perpetual debt'.  Focusing on my health took everything I had and\
  \ I saw no point in trying to stop things like home foreclosure or vehicle repo',\
  \ when it wouldn't matter anyway (Let alone being romantic).\n\nShe got into school\
  \ and wanted me to ask for money because she needed a computer. I gave away my PS4\
  \ and laptop to get her one and reminded her I'd never do \\*that\\*. Now were pregnant\
  \ (Found out yesterday). Now she is saying that she can't trust that I can support\
  \ a family  (She is Pro-life btw).....Shes not wrong, I can't see how I'm going\
  \ to make it work. Says I have to \"set aside my pride\" for our child and ask for\
  \ help. \n\n1. I do NOT agree that her going back to school is a \"good move to\
  \ solidify our future stability\" and if anything it will only hurt us...If the\
  \ present isn't stable then what kind of future is she expecting anyway? Probably\
  \ one without me, Im guessing. \n2. She talks about how I have to \"Do whatever\
  \ it takes\" and its \"on me\" but doesn't grasp that I've been barley surviving\
  \ and I \\*have\\* been doing whatever it takes since we met!\n3.  And most importantly\
  \ shes not wanting me to beg with the headline of \"Financial hardship, baby on\
  \ the way\", she wants to use my disabilities/story because it would be a \"Sure\
  \ deal\". If she truly understands that the guilt and shame of making a GoFundMe\
  \ could easily threaten my mental health, then in what world would this be a good\
  \ idea? I really just got myself back together and I'm not about to ask some Non-profit\
  \ or some friendly person at the expense of my health...even if a new baby will\
  \ really need it.\n\n  I can't elaborate on this but I feel like she is going to\
  \ threaten to leave me and take my unborn child two states away (To her home) unless\
  \ I ask for money. If she does that then no matter what I decide I'm fucked\n\n\
  TL;DR, Wife wants me to ask Charities for money for my disability, risking my mental\
  \ health, in order to provide for an unexpected newborn and I believe she knows\
  \ my position is so unwavering that shes using it to justify leaving"
title: AITA for telling my wife that I refuse a 'hand up' or a 'hand out' even at
  the possible expense of our child's well being?
