selftext: " So, a bit of info about me \\[37M\\], I\u2019m Bi, but in recent years\
  \ mostly date women. I have been dating my current girlfriend \\[29F\\] for about\
  \ 2 years now, and things are starting to get more serious.\n\nA few nights ago,\
  \ we were talking about our pasts and she randomly asked me how many people I have\
  \ had sex with. I told her I have been with about 10 women but I\u2019m not sure\
  \ how many men. She seemed shocked when she realized I was serious, and asked what\
  \ the hell I meant, I explained to her that I was bi and that I had just never felt\
  \ any need to mention it until now.\n\nShe seemed to be processing it, but then\
  \ she said \u201Cwait a minute, you said you don\u2019t know how many men you\u2019\
  ve been with, what do you mean by that\u201D. I explained that I had lost count\
  \ after the first 300. She screamed \u201CWhat the hell\u201D and I explained that\
  \ when I was about 22, I had decided to go on a trip to Europe and spend the year\
  \ there, but I had no money at the time, so I worked as a male prostitute to finance\
  \ the trip, that was how I paid for everything for the entire year I was there.\n\
  \nAt this point she started freaking out and panicking that I must have AIDS and\
  \ that I must have infected her. I told her not to be ridiculous, this had all been\
  \ over 15 years ago and if I had AIDS I sure as hell would have known about it before\
  \ now. I also called her out on her homophobic behavior. She started crying and\
  \ said she thought I was a good traditional man that would have made a fantastic\
  \ husband. I told her that I am.\n\nBut she left and has ducked my calls for the\
  \ last few days, the one time I managed to get hold of her by calling from a different\
  \ number, she screamed at me that I was a gross, disgusting asshole and that I should\
  \ have told her all of this stuff 2 years ago when we started dating. She said she\
  \ feels absolutely filthy having been with me and that she will never feel clean\
  \ again.\n\nI feel like, how was I to know this would be a deal breaker for her?\
  \ To me it's all very casual and i thought she would feel the same way. AITA?"

  point in the relationship?
