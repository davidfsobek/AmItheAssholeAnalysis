selftext: 'I \[34M\] have been married to my wife \[37F\] for 8 years and before that
  we dated for 3 years. We have three children with the youngest being 3 years old.
  After the last child I noticed a sudden change in my wife, we were communicating
  less and our sex life dropped off the map. I gave her time and space but after 6
  months nothing had changed so I proposed we go to couple''s counselling. She didn''t
  open up at first but after a few sessions she voiced some concerns and we promised
  to work on things together. Her main concern was that i wasn''t spending enough
  time with the kids and wasn''t helping around the house so I changed this. The problem
  is that the woman who was with me at the counselling sessions was a different woman
  to the one at home. It''s as if as soon as we left the building she had a memory
  wipe and nothing would changed.


  I gave her time and space to deal with things, I spent more time with the kids and
  helped out around the house so that I''m primarily doing everything. I have no issues
  with this, I just want my wife to be happy. 2 years later however and nothing has
  changed, she''s become more reserved and cold and I stopped trying to initiate sex
  18 months ago. She''s still a wonderful and loving mother, but towards me and others
  she''s cold and distant. We stopped going to counselling at her insistence, or rather
  her lack of agreeing to go, and any suggestion of therapy or help was ignored. In
  short, I tried everything I could and in the end I thought it best to leave her
  alone.


  Just under a year ago I was wrestling the snake and decided to go on a cam site
  for inspiration. There was one girl who looked pretty similar to my wife so I checked
  her out, instead of waxing the carrot I just listened to her talk for about an hour.
  I was entranced and every couple of days or so I''d tune into her broadcast just
  to listen to the music or talk with her. There was nothing sexual about it for me
  and I''d occasionally send her a tip. After a couple of months we shared a few e-mails
  and I was mostly using her to talk about my wife but it soon become a sort of weird
  "friendship". We exchange e-mails, occasional snail mail letters and for holidays/birthdays
  we send packages.


  I told my wife about this and explained she was just a friend I was talking to,
  but there was no emotion back from her. Last week the camgirl sent me some of her
  home-made honey and when my sister in law was round she pulled me aside and pretty
  much blew up at me. She claimed I was an arsehole for essentially abandoning my
  wife for this camgirl and that I shouldn''t be wasting the family''s money on her
  and that I was being used.


  INFO: In regards to money we have a joint account that we each pay into that covers
  things like the mortgage, bills, savings and funds for our children. I also have
  my own savings that I pay towards and I leave myself with a set amount each month
  that is for me to do with what I wish. This is where my "tips" come from.'
