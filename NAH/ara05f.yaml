selftext: "Yesterday online I saw a post titled \u201CMy First ever LinkedIn Video.\
  \ Me giving out sandwiches to the poor.\u201D \n\nI thought this was incredibly\
  \ vain so I commented \u201CIt was nice of you to do this but I\u2019ve never been\
  \ able to understand why people feel the need to video tape and post themselves\
  \ doing something nice. Doesn\u2019t this kind of defeat the entire purpose of doing\
  \ a good deed? it becomes clear that your motivation isn\u2019t exclusively that\
  \ you want to help others\u201D\n\nI received a good amount of hate for this comment\
  \ so I\u2019m wondering reddit - AM I THE ASSHOLE?? "
title: AITA - I saw a video of this guy video taping himself giving sandwiches to
  homeless people and I commented that he was vain
