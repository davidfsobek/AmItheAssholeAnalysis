selftext: "So theres not too much to say, I guess I'm more curious in others opinions\
  \ on this.  I am an approx 22.5 year old man, I recently snagged a really really\
  \ good job.  I work as a corporate level administrator in the trucking industry.\
  \  It's been a pretty sweet gig so far and have no complaints as of yet (2 months\
  \ in). I would also like to preface the following with saying that I work with a\
  \ very diverse staff of coworkers who are all as professional as they can be, rarely\
  \ is it that someone cant pull their own weight. \n\nAbout a week ago I was walking\
  \ through the parking lot to my car after the end of the day, and I was looking\
  \ at the sunset through the chain link fence.  As my eyes darted around i happened\
  \ to notice a pink metal plate bolted onto the fence, I thought to myself \"woah,\
  \ what's that and how did i not notice it before?\" So i started reading it and\
  \ I was immediately greeted with slight disappointment.  Basically, it read as follows\
  \ \"FEMALE EMPLOYEE PARKING SPACE ONLY!\" with a large symbol in the middle of the\
  \ sign which is also seen on women's public bathrooms.  \n\nNow, let me clarify\
  \ I am not \"Irate\" or \"fuming\" about it, but I dont really buy into the whole\
  \ chivalry, white knighting culture that the men of previous generations upheld\
  \ *fedora intensifies*.  I even asked my fiance when I got home, just to get a female\
  \ insight on it.  She said she thought it was stupid.  I guess I'm just coming from\
  \ the territory of you can show that your a diverse company dedicated to equality,\
  \ without making tedious or unimportant decisions like special parking.  Just my\
  \ two cents on it though. "
