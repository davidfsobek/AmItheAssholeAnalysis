selftext: "Let me preface this off by blaming all of you, the entirety of reddit for\
  \ desensitizing me, and giving me major trust issues on April fools day.\n\nSo here\
  \ it goes... Yesterday I got a group text from my wifes (sarah) side of the family\
  \ stating there was an emergency family meeting happening that night over dinner\
  \ at my mother in laws (Barb) house. \n\nI immediately had april fools spidey senses\
  \ starting to tingle, but we haven't all got together since Christmas so I overlooked\
  \ it and said we (my wife and I ) were in. \n\nWe were the last to arrive and it\
  \ was pretty somber when we walked in. We all sat down at the table and my wifes\
  \ brother (Tim) informed the family that his wife (Ashley)  has been having an affair\
  \ and they are divorcing. The affair was with a long time close family friend (Chris)\
  \ who lived a block away.\n\n\nChris' wife (jen) had caught them when she came home\
  \ early one day last week and broke the news to my brother in law Tim. \n\nBoth\
  \ families have been friends for years. They live less than a block from each other,\
  \ they each have been married for 15+ years, have 4 kids right around the same age.\
  \ Honestly, I have always thought both of them were picture perfect families. Hell,\
  \ all four of them and their kids were at our house two weeks ago for a bbq. \n\n\
  Anyways after airing a lot of dirty laundry, and their plans to divorce, how it\
  \ could effect future family functions, and opening it up to the group of any questions...\
  \ there was silence. \n\nI broke the silence with laughter and a slow clap. Saying\
  \ this was the best april fools gag I've ever seen but I wasn't falling for it.\
  \ I told Ashley and especially Tim they need to consider going into theater, their\
  \ performances were top notch and tears seemed genuine. \n\nBeing the newest member\
  \ of the family (my wife and I married 6 months ago) this was probably not the best\
  \ thing to say in hindsight. I probably should not have said anything. \n\nEveryone\
  \ in the room looked horrified. \n\nMy mother in law, who had been crying the entire\
  \ time, lost all composure. She left the room in hysterics and did not return before\
  \ we left. \n\nTim, just shook his head, and his cheating wife actually let out\
  \ a brief chuckle before calling me out for being a dumbass for thinking this was\
  \ a ruse. Then berating me for being so insensitive. \n\n\nThe rest of the family\
  \ sat in silence shaking their heads as my wife berated me for trying to make a\
  \ joke out of a serious situation...\n\n\nI am still dumbfounded. In hindsight,\
  \ I probably should have sat in silence... but I honestly still feel like I was\
  \ calling out an april fools gag. \n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\n"
