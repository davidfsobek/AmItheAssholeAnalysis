selftext: 'I''m going to try to keep this short and simple. I always tell my daughter
  and my stepdaughter if they''re ever in a situation that they need to get out of,
  just call me and I''ll drop whatever I''m doing and I will pick them up no questions
  asked no judgments made. I let them know that I used to be a teenager once before,
  I told them everyone is entitled to make bad decisions every now and then. We''re
  only human and it''s a part of life.


  Last weekend I got a call from my stepdaughter (17), she told me she snuck out of
  the house and went to a party and had too much to drink. She was scared of passing
  out at the party because there was people there she didn''t know.


  I got there just in time, she was so drunk she couldn''t even walk. I had to pick
  her up and carry her to the car. I told her I was disappointed that she snuck out,
  but I also told her I was glad she made the right choice, the safe choice to have
  me pick her up.


  I haven''t told my wife about it, because I don''t want to violate the deal I made
  with her. I want her to know that she can trust me. I just hope I''m making the
  right choice.'
