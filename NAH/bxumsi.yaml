selftext: "Wife and I got married as widowers. My late wife and daughter passed away\
  \ in an accident. My daughter was only 1 when she passed away. My current wife had\
  \ 3 yo twins when we got married. The girls are 15 now.\n\nSo, yesterday when wife\
  \ and I were watching a movie, she told me that the girls were planning a surprise\
  \ for me on their birthday. And when I asked her what it was, she told me that they\
  \ wanted me to adopt them. I was really happy, because it meant that I had done\
  \ a good job, but unfortunately I cannot adopt them. I'm actually glad that my wife\
  \ told me that. A surprise would have caught me off guard. \n\nThe thing is, my\
  \ wife and I had discussed about this when they were young. I made it clear that\
  \ I didn't want to adopt anyone or have more children. Call it coping up with my\
  \ daughter's death or whatever, but I've never felt comfortable thinking about it.\
  \ My wife is now asking me to say yes. \n\nI've been there for them and I'll always\
  \ be there for them. I love them but I don't think I'll be comfortable adopting\
  \ them. WIBTA here?"
