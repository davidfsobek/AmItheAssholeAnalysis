selftext: 'I''m getting a major surgery done in about three weeks and I was told there''s
  a 60-80% chance it will kill me. It''s 60% if I do all the things the surgeon told
  me to do to prepare for the surgery (take supplements, gain weight fast, lots of
  protein) and I''m following all the rules. So let''s say my chances of dying are
  60%. That''s not great but not too horrible.


  The thing is that I''ve had this exact surgery before and I came out just fine so
  my family has no reason to think this time will be any different (aside from the
  risk involved with any surgery). However for reasons involving My Medical Condition
  (TM), this time the surgery is riskier.


  My family consists of my older brother (28M) who I (27M) live with and my mom (54F)
  who lives on the other side of the country. My brother is very protective of me
  and my mom still acts like I''m her little boy. The only reasons I could think of
  to tell them would be:


  1. Give them time to prepare for the possibility of my death. BUT I don''t think
  this is something they can prepare for. I''m sure they''d just be miserable for
  the time leading up to the surgery. I don''t want that.

  2. Give us all a chance to make happy memories before the surgery. Again I don''t
  think that can happen when we''d only be doing it because I might die soon. It would
  feel forced and desperate and they would only be pretending to not be miserable
  and I''d be unhappy because I would know they''re miserable.


  I''m leaning towards "ignorance is bliss" for everyone involved. If I survive, no
  harm done and all that potential misery would be for nothing. If I die, well that''s
  a risk of any surgery and their final moments with me wouldn''t have had that misery.
  And with My Medical Condition (TM) it''s unlikely I''d make it to retirement age
  anyway.


  But is it right for me to hide something this big, even if it''s to spare them pain?
  What are your thoughts?


  EDIT: The surgery is 100% necessary. I WILL die without it, but it would take maybe
  a year or so and be very unpleasant.


  Edit2: I''ve already gone over how I''d want my body dealt with the last time I
  had surgery (donated to science or cremated if science doesn''t want it). I have
  no debts and my brother knows about all my bank accounts.


  Edit3: I will write letters to them.


  Edit4: Maybe I wasn''t very clear about this because a few people have commented
  about it. I''m not hiding the surgery itself from my family, just how risky it is.
  They''re going to come see me off and we''ll say our I love yous and good lucks
  at the hospital.


  Edit5: I already have an advanced medical directive from the last time I had this
  surgery.


  And YES I promise to post an update if I survive! You''re all very sweet for wishing
  me well. It turns out Reddit isn''t as scary as I feared (I just joined and this
  is my first post).


  Edit6: Thanks to everyone who responded with their thoughts! I honestly don''t know
  what I want anymore. There seems to be no good answer and spending the last 4 hours
  reading what everyone has said and thinking about my upcoming surgery has left me
  feeling pretty drained. I''m going to take a break and recharge.


  EDIT7: Okay I''m feeling very overwhelmed here. I was only expecting to get 10 comments,
  maybe 20 at the most. Now there''s nearly 400 comments. I wrote this post feeling
  pretty confident of my decision but I wanted to see if anyone out there had a different
  perspective, another point of view that I hadn''t considered. After reading over
  100 of these comments I don''t know what I should do anymore. I''m feeling guilty
  for hiding this but I can''t see what the right thing to do is. There probably *isn''t*
  a right thing to do.


  So many of you have shared their stories and experiences with the death of a loved
  one. I''m truly sorry you had to go through that and I appreciate your perspectives.
  I''m going to revisit this in the morning and look at this with fresh eyes.


  PS: To all the people who are setting reminders for three weeks (a bit morbid but
  I understand) you should make it for four weeks. If I survive, I''ll need time to
  recover and get out of the ICU before I come back to Reddit.'

  kill me?
