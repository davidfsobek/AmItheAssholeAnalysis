selftext: "For the last year I\u2019ve had a rewards card to a local gas station chain\
  \ that lets me get deals and store coupons. \n\n\nAbout a week ago I went into the\
  \ store to get a beverage, and swiped my rewards card before swiping my debit, however\
  \ after the card reader finished processing the rewards card the total due went\
  \ to 0 and the cashier asked if I wanted a receipt. At this point I figured I had\
  \ just used a deal I don\u2019t know about, but the next time I went the same thing\
  \ happened. So the next several times I\u2019ve gone I\u2019ve made around 10 dollar\
  \ purchases with a variety of different items, and every single time it\u2019s been\
  \ free.\n\n\nI\u2019m thinking something is wrong and I should tell someone, but\
  \ I kinda wanna keep getting free stuff. AITA?\n\nUpdate: Hi guys\n\nI thought I\
  \ had the golden ticket, I really did. \n\nI thought I had the coveted, all expenses\
  \ paid, lifetime gas station experience moving forward. The rewards card that wouldn\u2019\
  t stop rewarding. Last night I dreamed about all the bags of mixed nuts, the hardest\
  \ of the boiled eggs, the bottles of old orange juice, the not-so-hot dogs that\
  \ have been rolling right next to the hispanic egg rolls for the last 6 hours, that\
  \ were just sitting there waiting for me to get my grubby, stinky little paws on\
  \ them.\n\n\nI wanted to ask you fine people if I was the asshole real quick before\
  \ I went balls deep and pilfered my way through a Midwest convenience store chain.\
  \ I\u2019ll be honest I didn\u2019t care what people said though. I was high on\
  \ the fact that I had, more or less, the most power in the entire world.\n\n\nAfter\
  \ I made the post I made my daily trip to indulge in my kingdom, not caring that\
  \ like 15 people on my post had just been like, \u201CI mean you kinda suck as a\
  \ person overall like a 0/10 also your ugly and your posture is bad you need to\
  \ fix that it\u2019s good for your spinal health and overall makes you feel better\
  \ and more confident, but yeah you shouldn\u2019t steal\u201D\n\n\nI made my way\
  \ around the store picking up every possible box of hard boiled eggs, and also grabbed\
  \ an energy drink cause I was sleepy. And then I went to perform the maneuver. I\
  \ strode passionately, arms filled to the brim with eggness, to the front counter.\n\
  \nIt was a gift card. \n\n\nI had completely forgotten my giver of birth had given\
  \ it to me like 2 months ago, and it had stayed hidden in my wallet until last week\
  \ in a frantic, anxiety filled search for the rewards card, I found it and my dumb\
  \ little brain couldn\u2019t read the text that said \u201Cgift card\u201D on the\
  \ bottom.\n\nI\u2019m not going to lie a tear or two fell when the cashier was like\
  \ \u201Calright weirdo, there was $5.29 left on that, now you owe $43.82.\u201D\
  \ But I sucked it up and paid, and now all I have is sadness and a fair amount of\
  \ protein and amino acids at only 77 calories per portion.\n\nTL;DR I thought I\
  \ had it all but now I just have a lot of eggs.\n\nUpdate 2: to everyone saying\
  \ this is a made up story, I can tell you unfortunately it is not. I wouldn\u2019\
  t be able to eggzagerate something like this."

  saying anything about it.
