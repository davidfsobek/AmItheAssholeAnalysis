selftext: While sitting next to my girlfriend on a plane I was bored as fuck and looking
  at the maps are that are found in the back of the airline magazines. A conversation
  led to her revealing that she did not know where Florida was on the map. Keep in
  mind she had graduated a private high school and is currently going into her senior
  year of college. Conversation progressed further into me finding out she could not
  point out AUSTRALIA either. I was visibly astonished at this revelation and essentially
  said "...are you kidding." She immediately got defensive calling me an asshole for
  making her feel stupid. I do feel bad for making her feel stupid, although I feel
  as if my reaction to her not being educated on such elementary shit was warranted
  and may even be a wake up call for her to learn some basic geography... AITA?

  not point out Florida on a map?
