selftext: "I'm 28M, my late wife passed two years ago. She had a son (5M now) from\
  \ a prior relationship but my wife and I had a daughter as well (nearly 2F now).\
  \ She passed during childbirth. My stepson is low functioning ASD and has other\
  \ health disorders related to the heart and lungs. My wife was a SAHM ever since\
  \ I met her.\n\nI thought I was equipped to manage both children but I learned very\
  \ quickly how hard my wife had it before I came into the picture. Precisely zero\
  \ daycares near me will accept my stepson because of his conditions. \n\nHe has\
  \ a ventral septal defect which he has episodes over frequently: his skin will turn\
  \ blue, he becomes disoriented, and if he's not restrained in a way to make him\
  \ kneel down, it's a trip to the hospital. He's unable to do this on his own and\
  \ physically resists. Just this year alone I've had eight hospital visits for this.\
  \ This is the big one but other challenges exist, too.\n\nI had to quit my dream\
  \ job to care for him because he's been turned away from every daycare. I had to\
  \ go on government assistance which was difficult because I was making decent money\
  \ beforehand. Difficult not only in lifestyle change but also in just getting approved.\n\
  \nAfter two years of this, my life is going nowhere. I can't get a girlfriend, I\
  \ can't get a job, I have pretty much no support here. My wife had no family, I\
  \ have family who has shunned me for dating a single mother to begin with. The only\
  \ one who gives me some reprieve is my mother who will babysit one day a week for\
  \ me. I feel like my daughter suffers because we can't do anything: she's at the\
  \ age when we'd be going to parks yet she can't even speak yet. My focus is almost\
  \ entirely on my stepson.\n\nI want to give him up for adoption because I don't\
  \ know if I'm equipped to do this anymore. More importantly, I want a life myself,\
  \ too. I don't want to frame him as a problem because he's innocent in this, but\
  \ if he was with another family, I might be accepted into my family again. I might\
  \ be able to form new relationships. I'll be able to work, spend more time with\
  \ my daughter, let her flourish.\n\nBut I'd be failing my stepson, my late wife's\
  \ son. A little part of me thinks my wife would look down on me if I did this, yet\
  \ I don't know what else to do. He belongs in the care of medical professionals,\
  \ not me.\n\nWIBTA?"
