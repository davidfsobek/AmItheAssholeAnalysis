selftext: "My 17 yo daughter (youngest and we had her late) is 7 weeks pregnant (she\
  \ will be 18 by the time she gives birth) She is not in a relationship with the\
  \ father. He reeaallyyy, I can't stress this enough, does not want a baby. I honestly\
  \ don't even think he'll show up for the birth or anything.\n\nShe has decided to\
  \ continue with the pregnancy against all advice from practically every adult in\
  \ her life. After she insisted on not only continuing with the pregnancy but raising\
  \ the baby I asked her how she is going to manage that? This was the jist of the\
  \ convo:\n\nHer: I'll get a job. \nMe: who's going to watch baby while you're at\
  \ work? \nHer: I thought you and dad could.\nMe: absolutely not, I'm not raising\
  \ another baby.\n\nPretty much a back and forth for a bit that lead me to believe\
  \ that if she has this baby in this house, I'm practically going to be its mother.\
  \ I'm very recently retired  and my husband is retiring in exactly 11 months (there's\
  \ a countdown) and this is not how I want to spend my retirement years. It's not\
  \ fair to us. So I told her that she has until baby is born to find a place to live.\
  \ Husband has always been wrapped around her finger (which normally is endearing,\
  \ I love how much he loves our children) so he is not fully on board with that but\
  \ I feel like we need to be united on this. I just want to know if  I'm in the wrong\
  \ here.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: to everyone acting like I'm spending the next 7 months\
  \ ignoring her- I will help her get a job, get on assistance if need be, find affordable\
  \ housing etc. I just will not raise this baby."
