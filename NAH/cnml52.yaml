selftext: Pretty much the title. My son won a stuffed tiger at the fair last night
  and said he had named him "Tig". He asked me what its last name should be. I couldn't
  help myself and just instantly replied "Bitties". Then I turned to my wife to share
  a smirk, but she was pissed and quickly suggested a few different last names, but
  my son insisted that he liked "Bitties", so now his Tiger is Tig Bitties. My wife
  thinks it was completely inappropriate, I think it was a silly joke that went over
  his head and will have no negative ramifications.
title: AITA for suggesting my 7yo name his new stuffed tiger "Tig Bitties"?
