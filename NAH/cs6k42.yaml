selftext: "I know from the title, it definitely sounds like I would be the asshole\
  \ but please hear me out. I have an older cousin whose son, my nephew, is in his\
  \ early 20s. My nephew is autistic and holds a part time job, but is significantly\
  \ delayed in many developmental areas (I don\u2019t know the specifics) and will\
  \ never be independent according to his parents. \n\nRecently, my cousin and cousin-in-law\
  \ have been thinking about relocating to our state because of recent job opportunities,\
  \ and we\u2019ve hosted them in the past when they\u2019ve visited. The first time\
  \ they stayed with us (before my son was born), my nephew seemed to develop a strong\
  \ attachment to my wife and always wanted to be near her. He drew a picture of a\
  \ heart and picked some flowers from our yard and gave them to her before they left,\
  \ saying he loved her. My wife thought this was sweet and gently handled his crush\
  \ by telling him she would always love him as his aunt, but she was sure he would\
  \ find another girl to fill his heart soon. He told her no, she was his girlfriend.\
  \ \n\nThis weekend, they were staying with us again and my nephew again wanted to\
  \ be near my wife every chance he got. His mom and dad noticed and told him that\
  \ because my wife now had to care for our son, she couldn\u2019t pay attention to\
  \ him as much as before. He got upset telling us that she was his girlfriend and\
  \ had a meltdown, which caused my son to start crying. When my wife got up to take\
  \ our son to another room to calm him down, my nephew got up to follow and his dad\
  \ had to forcibly restrain him from following them. I stood up to block the hallway\
  \ into the separate room just in case he got away from his dad. \n\nOnce they calmed\
  \ him down, they apologized for his behavior and said they would keep better tabs\
  \ on him. Here\u2019s the part where I may be the asshole. I told my cousins I didn\u2019\
  t feel comfortable with my nephew being so possessive of my wife, and I know for\
  \ sure she didn\u2019t, especially since he seemed to be so jealous of our son.\
  \ I told them I couldn\u2019t allow their son in our home until he learned to control\
  \ himself and understand that my wife was not his girlfriend. I apologized but asked\
  \ them to get a hotel room for the rest of their stay and not to visit us again\
  \ unless they left my nephew behind with people they could trust and knew would\
  \ care for him, while they searched for jobs in our state. They didn\u2019t say\
  \ anything but looked saddened and went to the guest room with their son to pack\
  \ up their bags. \n\nI guess they must have told my extended family what happened\
  \ because my paternal grandmother called me this afternoon, telling me that I should\u2019\
  ve been more understanding and that I was wrong to ask them to leave. \n\nAm I the\
  \ asshole?\n\nEDIT for added info: \n\nThank you to everyone who took the time to\
  \ comment or private message me with their own experiences with family members who\
  \ are/were autistic. There\u2019s not nearly enough time for me to respond to each\
  \ of the comments (which honestly surprised me when I saw how many had reached out\
  \ to me), but I wanted to address some questions that had been asked. \n\n1. The\
  \ first one is that technically, my cousin is my second cousin. My dad is an only\
  \ child so the cousin I refer to in my post, is the son of my own dad\u2019s first\
  \ cousin (my paternal grandmother and his paternal grandfather were siblings). I\u2019\
  m not sure if this is correct but his autistic son would technically be my third\
  \ cousin(?). The reason I refer to him as my nephew is because he\u2019s the generation\
  \ after mine in our family tree and it\u2019s less of a mouthful to refer to him\
  \ as cousin-x-removed. A lot of people have posted that it\u2019s not correct to\
  \ refer to him as my nephew but to be frank, I don\u2019t care, and my family\u2019\
  s never followed this traditional genealogy nomenclature. I apologize if it was\
  \ misleading in my post. Without being specific, in the western state I was born\
  \ and grew up in, it\u2019s not uncommon to refer to even close (unrelated) adults\
  \ as uncles or aunts. I call him my nephew because my cousin and I were close and\
  \ I still hope to have a close relationship with him if at all possible (though\
  \ I don\u2019t know how after this situation). \n\n2. Some have asked if I was jealous\
  \ of my nephew calling my wife his gf. The first time, I thought it was amusing\
  \ and was surprised that he had any romantic notions towards anyone, let alone my\
  \ wife. Remember, in my mind he\u2019s my nephew and I never thought of him as anything\
  \ other than a large kid because of his developmental delays and normal (for him)\
  \ childlike behavior. Regarding the situation that happened this weekend, I was\
  \ only concerned for my wife and son\u2019s safety. I didn\u2019t know how he would\
  \ react and followed my cousin\u2019s lead, but wasn\u2019t about to let him get\
  \ near my wife and son once they left the room. \n\n3. I don\u2019t know what was\
  \ said to my paternal grandmother but I don\u2019t want to react in anger and want\
  \ to talk to my cousin once we\u2019ve both had time to process what happened and\
  \ calmed down."

  any more because of a romantic attachment to my wife?
