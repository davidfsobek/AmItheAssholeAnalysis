selftext: 'When my son was born, he had a dark skin complexion. Wife and I are both
  quite pale in complexion. Now originally I thought, this is common in babies at
  birth and maybe as he got older maybe something to do with the pigmentation (right
  term?) would change and his skin colour would look more like ours. That never happened.


  Now for some context I feel is necessary, early on in our marriage there were some
  trust and fidelity issues when I caught her pretty much on the brink of an emotional
  affair with her co worker. We stayed together and reconciled, it wasn''t easy but
  I was glad we did and she was very remorseful about how far she had let things go.
  The problem is, the other guy had the same complexion that my son does. Now this
  realisation has got me very paranoid.'
