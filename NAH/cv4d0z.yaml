selftext: "We've got twins, Sara and Syed.  They're 14 and entering High School this\
  \ year.  For clothes shopping, I decided I'd just give them some money and let them\
  \ buy whatever they want with minimal oversight.  I told them both I'd give them\
  \ $300 now, and another $300 for Winter.  My idea is they're old enough to budget\
  \ and make these kinds of decisions for themselves.  They can spend the money online,\
  \ or at the mall, whatever they want.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo they both said they wanted\
  \ to go to the mall and I went with them.  I wanted to just let them loose, but\
  \ my 2 14 year olds walking around with $600 didn't sit well with me.  We had a\
  \ few conversations about the most efficient way to do this.  Figure out what you\
  \ NEED, and what you WANT.  Find out the stores you want to shop at, get an idea\
  \ about their prices, then when we get to the mall do a walkthru at all of these\
  \ stores and find out what kind of deals they have and what items you want.  Then\
  \ go back, try shit on, and buy what you like.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSyed took my advice\
  \ well.  He went into a few stores, and found the ones that had the best deals that\
  \ he wanted.  He bought 3 pairs of pants for $100, 5 shirts for $100, then a pair\
  \ of Vans on clearance for $30.  He had money left over so he bought a video game.\
  \  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSara kinda just casually shopped through the stores and bought\
  \ what she liked.  All of the prices were reasonable so I didn't say much.  She\
  \ actually ended up with about 2x the amount of clothes (plus accessories) Syed\
  \ did.  But Sara started complaining that it wasn't enough money to get everything\
  \ she needed.  I told her then she can return some stuff and buy what she needed\
  \ somewhere else?  She said no, what she already bought is stuff she needs so that\
  \ wouldn't help.  I said oh well, thems the brakes.  You gotta budget better and\
  \ prioritize.  She'll get more money in a couple of months.  She was unhappy.\n\n\
  &#x200B;\n\nWhen we got home Sara cried to my Wife   She complained that its unfair\
  \ her and Syed get the same amount because girls have more needs when it comes to\
  \ clothes than boys.  She points out that she had to spend $50 just on underwear,\
  \ while Syed paid $0.  I actually demanded they both spend $30 to buy socks and\
  \ underwear that I paid for personally, separate from the $300.  Why does a 14 year\
  \ old girl need to spend $80 on underwear?  Obviously she already has underwear,\
  \ and I'm giving her more money in a few months.  I would just buy her more underwear\
  \ if she really needed it anyway.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBoth Wife and Sara insist that\
  \ Syed can just pretty much wear the same shit every day and no one would care.\
  \  But as a girl, she needs at least 2 weeks worth of unique outfits plus matching\
  \ accessories.  Its not about spending the same amount on both kids, its about spending\
  \ enough to put them on the same social level.  I'm not sure if thats true."
