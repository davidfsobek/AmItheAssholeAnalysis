selftext: "I have three fingers missing on my dominant hand. It's fine. I can type\
  \ and everything and even manage to tie my shoelaces most days (and on the days\
  \ I can't, that's the dyspraxia). However, I won't deny that it looks a bit odd\
  \ to most people. I only have my fourth and fifth fingers so my hand looks a bit\
  \ like a child's drawing of a rabbit, and not a good one.\n\nI'm used to people\
  \ asking about it, usually after staring for a good minute or two, but I still find\
  \ it annoying. I really don't get why you'd think it would be an OK thing to ask\
  \ someone about, but hey. I wasn't raised in a barn. Usually I nip the questioning\
  \ in the bud by just explaining the truth from the get go and assuming that enough\
  \ people will gossip about it that the message will spread by the end of the day\
  \ (it always, always does).\n\nAnyway, I started a new job about a month ago, and\
  \ I honestly could not face going through that same cycle again. I felt like the\
  \ time had come to not play into it any more and to make something out of it - and\
  \ I decided to make myself laugh. When the first new coworker asked about it, I\
  \ completely lied and told her that I chewed them off as a baby. I then decided\
  \ to tell the next person who asked that I cut them off with a plastic knife at\
  \ a picnic, and the next person that I was born with six fingers and they removed\
  \ too many, and so on. All genuinely ridiculous reasons but I'm a good actor and\
  \ they actually believed my stupid lies. I didn't expect them to (a plastic knife...\
  \ through bone?!) but there you go. Maybe they just thought there's no way I'd lie\
  \ about how I lost my fingers.\n\nWithin about 3 days, I learned that my coworkers\
  \ had been arguing about the actual reason and it seems like a lot of them now actively\
  \ dislike me for lying to them. I'm probably going to have to make some cupcakes\
  \ over the weekend with my super cool 3D printed adaptive whisk to get back into\
  \ their good books. \n\nAnyway, I told this story to my brother today and he told\
  \ me that I was an asshole because I caused tension within the office on my first\
  \ day and made people feel stupid for being gullible and believing my lies. My argument\
  \ is that I'm not the asshole because they were asking a rude, albeit common, question\
  \ and because I didn't do it with the intention of deceiving them, I was just honestly\
  \ fed up of the question and didn't think they'd think I actually severed three\
  \ fingers with dental floss when I was 3. I'll accept my judgement, though.\n\n\
  Update: gonna check out here, I think - getting real tired of explaining why it's\
  \ not cool to ask people why they lost limbs or digits just because you want to\
  \ sate your morbid curiosity. A few reminders for people: I'm not a male (don't\
  \ know why everyone assumed that!), don't ask people about something that could\
  \ be traumatic, especially when you don't actually know them, and when making cupcakes,\
  \ always cream the butter."
