selftext: 'So a little backstory we have been together for 2 and a half years and
  there has been talk of marriage, she is 25, I am 28.


  So obviously we are talking about intense personal shit a lot, kids, family etc
  we have good communication and rarely reach moments where we dont agree.


  Yesterday however she brought up her brother, her brother was a late, unplanned
  kid and as the chance is higher at later ages he was born with down syndrome, now
  the likely scenario is, he will survive his parents, as such my girlfriend said
  she wanted to let him live with us once they died or well if they die before he
  does and I said absolutely not.


  I explained the caretaking involved, the problems involved etc and that there is
  no way I would allow it especially not once we have kids(We both want kids in a
  year or two) She flipped, saying I am selfish and so forth.


  Now I dont think I am selfish like at all and I think she is basing her brothers
  care on the hour or two a week she spends with him and doesnt realize what 24 hour
  care would involve.


  So am I the asshole for not being okay with this?


  Edit 1: So I get a lot of comments concerning me being a dick for explaining shit
  to her and that she knows better than I, I figured I had made this clear in the
  post but apparantly not, her brother was a late child as a result she only experienced
  him up close as a baby until he was about 3, before she moved out at 18, she did
  not spend much time with her family during college and since we have been together
  she goes there about an hour a week with her parents there which she has only done
  since the past year or so before that it was considerably less. So I know for a
  fact she hardly knows what it entails, hell I hardly know the full extend of what
  it entails myself.


  Edit 2: I am sorry if some people think I am behaving like a bit of a cold dick
  but I am not great with emotional expression especially not on the internet, understand
  that I love my girlfriend and her family very much, including her brother I can
  simply not see myself being a life-long caretaker in my own home and I certainly
  wouldnt abandon him or am forcing her to abandon anyone, I know the subject itself
  may be hard for people to begin with though.


  Edit 3: I have noticed some people assume I do not want shit to do with him nor
  have him near my future kids etc, this is not the case I am merely drawing the line
  at having him move in, in the future, I am not at all opposed to having him in my
  life, arranging care for him etc'
title: AITA For telling my girlfriend I will never allow her brother with down syndrome
  to live with us
