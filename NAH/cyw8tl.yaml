selftext: "I will try to keep this short. My son cheated on his wife with another\
  \ woman and got the other woman pregnant. After a lot of counseling and soul-searching,\
  \ my son and his wife decided to remain married. They have three kids (2 girls and\
  \ a boy), who are obviously my grandchildren. I am very close with them and have\
  \ spoiled them since they were born. \n\nI have no relationship with the child my\
  \ son had with the other woman. I believe he is almost 2 now. I think it would pain\
  \ my daughter-in-law (who is like my own daughter - I have known her since she was\
  \ in her young teens) if I had a real relationship with this child. She never talks\
  \ about him at all. As for my son, I know he pays child support. I believe he sees\
  \ the child only occasionally though. Maybe once every few months - I\u2019m not\
  \ sure. \n\nAnyhow, the child\u2019s mother reached out to me. Apparently she got\
  \ my number from my son. She told me who it was and basically asked if I wanted\
  \ to have a relationship with my grandson. I said I wasn\u2019t sure it was a good\
  \ idea and she hung up the phone. \n\nI obviously told my son about this phone call.\
  \ He said he gave the woman my number but he didn\u2019t know what she was going\
  \ to say. When I explained what she wanted, he had no reaction. So I dropped the\
  \ subject. \n\nI\u2019m posting this on a new account because I prefer not to have\
  \ my personal family business on my primary one. I am just looking for impartial\
  \ judgment. Thanks."
