selftext: "Throwaway because I'm pretty sure I'm the asshole in the situation.\n\n\
  I dated \"Sara\" from 2014 to 2016 (just under 2 years total). Looking back on it,\
  \ she was emotionally abusive, and absolutely manipulative. To keep things short:\
  \ she treated me poorly and I was a doormat. I learned a ton from that experience,\
  \ and have since reflected on that relationship as a period where I emerged with\
  \ serious personal growth and  much more self respect.\n\nThe relationship ended\
  \ when she cheated on me. She broke up with me, and I literally never saw her again.\
  \ Immediately after the breakup, I blocked her on EVERYTHING, deleted pictures,\
  \ etc. The relationship was a mess and that's how I decided to move on. I literally\
  \ haven't even seen a picture of her since the day we broke up. \n\nSo, fast forward\
  \ to today, 3+ years since we broke up. I get a call from an unknown number. Normally\
  \ I wouldn't answer, but I'm waiting to hear back from some job applications, so\
  \ answered. To my surprise, it was Sara's mom. \n\nI was confused, but politely\
  \ asked her why she was contacting me. She goes on to inform me that Sara was killed\
  \ in a car accident a few days prior, and that she was letting me know. She said\
  \ that Sara's funeral would be in a few days and told me where it is being held.\
  \ \n\nI told her that I am so sorry for her loss. I offered my condolences, but\
  \ told her I wouldn't be attending the funeral. She got very upset and asked me\
  \ why. I told her that our relationship didn't end well, and that it felt inappropriate\
  \ overall. \n\nHer mom got increasingly upset, and said that she was hoping I'd\
  \ say a few words at her funeral. I was shocked. I asked if she knew why we had\
  \ broken up. Apparently, Sara had told her family that I had gotten a job elsewhere\
  \ and we ended things amicably, and that she thought we remained in touch. I informed\
  \ her that we broke up because she had cheated on me, and that I hadn't spoken to\
  \ her in years. I kept trying to end the call, but she was very upset and I felt\
  \ horrible; she had just lost her daughter. I was very uncomfortable and said something\
  \ I shouldn't have. After a minute or two more of back and forth, I said \"Look,\
  \ I didn't have anything nice to say about her when she was alive, and I don't have\
  \ anything nice to say about her now. I won't be attending.\" \n\nI realize how\
  \ insensitive that was, but I didn't know how else to convey what I was feeling.\
  \ I'm not happy she's dead, I'd never wish that on anyone. But the fact of the matter\
  \ is, her death didn't make me feel good or bad. It has no impact on my life at\
  \ all. \n\nI've been getting messages from some of her friends (who I also haven't\
  \ spoken to in years) because apparently her mom is now telling people I'm shit-talking\
  \ her dead daughter. They aren't part of my social circle so there's really no backlash,\
  \ but it didn't feel great to read their messages. I absolutely won't be going to\
  \ the funeral, but I'm wondering if I should reach out and apologize to her mom."
