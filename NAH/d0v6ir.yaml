selftext: "My wife and I (both mid 30s) have been happily married for nine years.\
  \ We don't have any kids and don't want kids. We had the \"what if\" talk before\
  \ getting married; she told me she would want to have an abortion if she ever got\
  \ pregnant.\n\nYesterday my wife told me she's nine weeks pregnant. She's on the\
  \ pill, but accidents happen. She said she wants to carry to term and give the baby\
  \ up for adoption. Naturally, I was surprised by the news and her change of mind.\
  \ I asked her if she considered getting an abortion. She said she had, but she doesn't\
  \ want to because she feels a bond to the fetus. She told me she has been researching\
  \ adoption and learned that the local adoption agencies only accept birth mothers\
  \ who are okay with having an open adoption. I told her I wasn't really comfortable\
  \ with this and asked her if she would have an abortion. She started crying and\
  \ spent the night at her sister's place. She wont answer my phone calls.\n\nI'm\
  \ uncomfortable with this for a few reasons. I was adopted a birth and my adoptive\
  \ parents weren't the best. I know this isn't the case for everyone who was adopted,\
  \ but I can't help but have a negative view about it. A few years ago I tried to\
  \ find my biological parents to learn my medical history, but I couldn't. I was\
  \ sore about it for a little while, but it doesn't bother me anymore. My wife is\
  \ aware of these points.\n\nI just don't want to pass on my genes because they're\
  \ essentially a mystery to me. I also don't like kids. My wife said she actually\
  \ would prefer to keep the baby, but she knows I wouldn't want to; so she said having\
  \ an open adoption sounded like a reasonable compromise. I understand why she thinks\
  \ that, but I still don't want to have any biological children, regardless of how\
  \ much/little I would be involved in raising him or her.\n\nAITA for asking my wife\
  \ to have an abortion?\n\nEdit: my wife takes birth control for reasons other than\
  \ contraception. If she ever wanted to stop taking it, I would support her 100%.\
  \ I realize that I\u2019m an idiot for not getting a vasectomy a long time ago though.\
  \ It honestly never occurred to me until now (I think because my wife has always\
  \ been on birth control and said she would have an abortion). I see now that it\
  \ was irresponsible of me to not get one regardless. I\u2019m going to get snipped\
  \ ASAP.\n\nEdit #2: She and I talked; it was emotional for both of us, but no voices\
  \ were raised. Here are the main takeaways:\n\n* I apologized for putting her in\
  \ this position by being an idiot and not getting a vasectomy earlier. I also apologized\
  \ if she felt like I was pressuring her when I asked her to have an abortion. I\
  \ didn't mean to pressure her, but I know words aren't always received as we intended.\
  \ She said she felt pressured a little, but forgave me because she knows I was totally\
  \ caught off guard.\n* She apologized for having a change of heart regarding abortion.\
  \ She said she was really surprised by her own feelings and hopes I don't feel like\
  \ she tricked me (I don't).\n* We mutually agreed that it would be good to spend\
  \ one more night apart to really think. We've always have a strong marriage, and\
  \ we're both committed to working through this - whatever that may look like."
