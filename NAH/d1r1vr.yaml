selftext: "Edit/Update:\n\nThe moderators have been kind enough to let me update my\
  \ post.\n\nI know many, many people have asked about the skillset I mentioned. I\
  \ just can't be specific because it'll make my younger kids' company identifiable\
  \ with a quick search. I will say it's nothing mysterious and is a combination of\
  \ woodworking, metalworking and some masonry sometimes. It's just a niche product\
  \ and not many people do it. The tools and techniques are unorthodox.\n\nI spent\
  \ a lot of time reflecting yesterday after reading everyone's comments.\n\nI have\
  \ talked to my younger kids and I explained to them that even if they aren't happy\
  \ with how their brother approached it, it's clear he feels left out from our family\
  \ and it's all our responsibilities to help fix this.\n\nThey agreed to extend the\
  \ offer of apprenticeship again to their brother where he works and learns as a\
  \ salaried employee. But they've made it clear that no ownership can be transferred\
  \ after he's put in at least three years of work like they have. I actually think\
  \ this is generous because they are paying a salary that they don't need to.\n\n\
  However, I'm not sure if my oldest will go for this. He is feeling some sort of\
  \ way about working for his brothers, not with them.\n\nI reached out to a teacher\
  \ in Alaska who I know casually. He might do me a favor and take on an apprentice.\
  \ \n\nI need to scrounge up some money and see if I can send my son there. But again,\
  \ it's Alaska and I'm not sure if my son will be receptive.\n\nI don't know what\
  \ else I can offer at this point. My wife is disgusted that we've become that family\
  \ that is fighting about money. She wants to force the twins to give a stake in\
  \ the company to their brother but I really think it's a bad idea. They need to\
  \ fix their conflict first or it'll just be a disaster. I don't believe we should\
  \ be telling our younger kids on how to run their company.\n\nI'll be meeting my\
  \ son this Friday for dinner. I hope he'll be ok with at least one of the options.\n\
  \nI also need to talk to my parents to stop creating more issues. They've always\
  \ enjoyed chaos and like pitting people against each other. It's not helping.\n\n\
  Thanks everyone.\n\n\nThis is the original story:\n\nThis has quite literally fractured\
  \ my family.\n\nI have an older son from my first marriage who's now 24. I have\
  \ two younger kids from my current marriage who are 21 year old twins.\n\nMy divorce\
  \ occurred right after my son was born. \n\nOver the years, my visitation has been\
  \ primarily summers and holidays since my ex-wife moved to a different state.\n\n\
  I have a particular skillset I'm was very good at. And all three of my kids have\
  \ expressed interest in it. Unfortunately, I have only been able to meaningfuly\
  \ teach it to my younger kids.\n\nThis was because to make my visitation with my\
  \ older son more memorable, I would do camping/vacations etc. I didn't have time\
  \ to teach him properly.\n\nAlso, anything I did try to teach him was forgotten\
  \ and not practised because he lived in an apartment with his mother.\n\nThe major\
  \ issue now is that my younger kids have started a company after highschool using\
  \ this skill. I provided the initial funds and as such have a 33% stake in it. This\
  \ company has really soared this past year and it's making a lot of money.\n\nMy\
  \ older son graduated from college and is doing a job he hates and is not exactly\
  \ making a lot of money. Especially compared to his siblings.\n\nPart of this is\
  \ my fault because he did ask to take a few years off after highschool and maybe\
  \ have me teach him what I knew but my wife was battling cancer at the time and\
  \ I told him I couldn't.\n\nAnd now, I'm not well enough to teach anymore.\n\nHe\
  \ is now telling me to include him in this company as a equal partner. That he'll\
  \ do the finances.\n\nThis was not received well by his siblings who say they do\
  \ basically 95% of the work. And that he didn't struggle in the earlier years to\
  \ get it running.\n\nI'm really at a loss here. I thought of just giving my share\
  \ of the company to my oldest son but it does seem unfair to his siblings who started\
  \ this company in the first place.\n\nMy oldest has become very bitter about this\
  \ and has involved my parents. They are taking his side and now my younger kids\
  \ are resentful that their grandparents have been turned against them.\n\nOur Sunday\
  \ family lunches are no longer happening and I'm having to see my oldest for dinner\
  \ on other days. And everytime I see him I'm getting accused of not treating him\
  \ fairly. It kills me because I made so many compromises to have him in my life\
  \ in a meaningful way.\n\nHe accused me on Saturday of pushing him out my new family\
  \ and loving his siblings more. I haven't been able to sleep since.\n\nShould I\
  \ have done all this differently?"
title: AITA for not teaching a skill to my oldest son that I taught his siblings because
  of the custody arrangement?
