selftext: "I (23M) live in a house share with 6 others. 2 other guys and 3 girls,\
  \ we're all the same age.\n\nNow one of the housemates, we'll call Cliff (23M).\
  \ I call him Cliff because he reminds me heavily of Brad Pitt's character in Once\
  \ Upon A Time in Hollywood. Cliff is a very good looking guy, he's friendly and\
  \ pretty much the poster boy for \"strong silent type\". He doesn't talk much and\
  \ is mysterious, but he's also very confident. \n\nThe thing is, we don't see that\
  \ much of him. But whenever we do, he's always bringing back a girl to the house.\
  \ Like a different girl each week. He occasionally comes to the parties we host\
  \ in our house and whenever he's there, people gravitate to him. \n\nNow the three\
  \ girls I live with, when they first met him, they tried to make moves on him while\
  \ we were out at a nightclub and he swerved away from them and went to other girls\
  \ in the club and got with them instead.  Since that day, these 3 girls have made\
  \ catty remarks about him.\n\nWhen we're in the kitchen (when Cliff obviously isn't\
  \ there), they'll talk about how rude Cliff is, how annoying he is, etc. They were\
  \ doing it yesterday so I just chimed in and said \"Are you sure you're not mad\
  \ at him because he basically rejected you all that one night?\" and they all got\
  \ super defensive and claimed they never moved to him (they clearly did...I saw\
  \ it clearly as did my other housemate) and then called me asshole.\n\nI told Cliff\
  \ what they said and he just looked at me and laughed, and then said \"Don't concern\
  \ yourself with what they say. They're childish\". So I dunno...AITA?"
title: AITA for suggesting that the reason my female friends dislike my housemate
  is because he's not sexually interested in them?
