selftext: "I\u2019ve known James since we were 11. He\u2019s been my best friend for\
  \ a long time and we\u2019re so close people ask us all the time if we are siblings\
  \ because we look alike AND even share a last name. He lives close by and is very\
  \ much integrated into all parts of my life. \n\nI had a crush on him growing up\
  \ and I asked him out a couple times when we got a little older. He always declined\
  \ and said we were just best friends. He\u2019s really goofy with me, and treats\
  \ me like I\u2019m his little sister and over time I came to agree with him. we\
  \ are 27 now and still the best of friends. My parents treat him like a son and\
  \ honestly, he\u2019s family. \n\nA couple months ago I had a ONS and found out\
  \ I was pregnant. Being as I have PCOS I am OVER THE MOON because I was always told\
  \ that the chance of me conceiving were very low. I am keeping this gorgeous miracle\
  \ baby and I cant explain how many tears of relief I shed. I\u2019ve always wanted\
  \ to be a mom and finally I have a chance at this. I have my own home, have savings,\
  \ I\u2019m in the right place in life and I\u2019m so happy. \n\nWhen James found\
  \ out he was also over the moon. He thought it was the coolest thing ever but then\
  \ gradually dropped off the face of the planet and he never wanted to hang out anymore.\
  \ Won\u2019t go to the gym with me, is too busy for the cinema, doesn\u2019t feel\
  \ like going to the mall, can\u2019t come with me to visit mutual friends, nada.\
  \ \n\nMy mom and dad invite him over every so often for dinner and so at the most\
  \ recent one I cornered him and asked why he was avoiding me so much and if he had\
  \ an issue. He confessed that he finds my growing baby bump disturbing and a little\
  \ gross. He said \u2018I know it\u2019s really weird of me but it just creeps me\
  \ out\u2019 \n\nI found that so demeaning and hurtful, and I burst out crying and\
  \ called him an immature asshole and told him to GTFO. He apologized and left and\
  \ I haven\u2019t heard from him since. I\u2019m so upset that he\u2019s ruining\
  \ a lifelong friendship over my goddamn baby bump! I want to reach out but I just\
  \ feel so .... alienated from my own body and made to feel gross and I\u2019m not\
  \ sure if I\u2019m the one that\u2019s being difficult or if it\u2019s him."
