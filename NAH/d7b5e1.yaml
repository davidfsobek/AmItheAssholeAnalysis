selftext: 'He makes close to 200K a year while I make 50K a year. My family is dead
  broke, his family is loaded. I''ve never asked him for money or to pay my bills.
  He''s the one who wants to do pay for everything and gets mad at me if I pay a bill
  using MY money. We even argued about when we have kids, he wants me to stay home
  while I want to work. I love my job. I''m frugal. I haven''t been to a mall in 15
  years and shop at Big Lots or Dollar Tree. I''ve never got attached to his wealth.

  He tells me that it''s common and not personal but it''s insulting. It makes me
  feel like he''s using me in someway. I understand someone wanting to protect themselves,
  but he wants me to give up my career to be a housewife and leave me in a situation
  where he can divorce me and leave me out to dry.'
