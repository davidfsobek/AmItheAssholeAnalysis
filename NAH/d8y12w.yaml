selftext: "I\u2019m married and have several children. Youngest are 2 and 3 and oldest\
  \ is a teen and 10 years old. The work I do is mentally, emotionally and physically\
  \ exhausting. Wife is primarily a stay at home mom which I know is hard work in\
  \ and of itself. This is not the first time we have gotten into fights over stuff\
  \ like this. So, AITAH?\n\nEdit: I work as a registered nurse on medical surgical\
  \ and telemetry. The demands on my time are to total strangers that are at times\
  \ very sick. I wipe complete strangers asses multiple times per day and I have told\
  \ my wife that on any given day I probably change more diapers and wipe more behinds\
  \ than she does. And it\u2019s not cute little baby bottoms that we created. It\u2019\
  s the elderly, the trauma patient, the demented patient, the mentally ill and so\
  \ on.\n\nI\u2019m also not referring to every night after a 12 hour shift. I\u2019\
  m talking about nights where I\u2019ve pulled off a string of them. That\u2019s\
  \ what exhausts me. If you catch me after the first few I\u2019m fine for the most\
  \ part. I\u2019ll help with baths and bed time. I\u2019ll read the kids a book.\
  \ I\u2019ll help with homework if mom didn\u2019t have the time. I do these things\
  \ willingly and with a smile because they are my kids too. My wife doesn\u2019t\
  \ have to ask me to do the dishes because I just do it. That\u2019s why when crap\
  \ like this happens (no pun intended) it throws me for a fkn loop.  \n\nAlso some\
  \ have asked if she works. She has a small business that she has had going on 7\
  \ years. I\u2019m proud of her and what she is able to do and accomplish with so\
  \ much on her plate. It makes her happy. When she comes home after being on her\
  \ feet for 6-9 hours she acts as if she\u2019s dying and immediately heads for the\
  \ bed room (migraines) and I never give her tasks or chores to do I just let her\
  \ be. Let her recover. \n\nAlso feel the need to add I\u2019m enrolled in an online\
  \ masters program which places more demand on my time to eventually get out of working\
  \ all these 12s and have a better schedule."
title: AITA for wanting to go straight to bed after working five 12 hour shifts in
  a row? Wife got upset at me for not wanting to change a dirty diaper while I was
  laying in my bed after the 5th shift.
