selftext: 'This is a silly argument and I really hope she listens to me. The facts.


  * We''ve been dating for about eight months and it''s going great!


  * My gf recently lost a bunch of weight and is really enjoying her new found body
  image and confidence. I''m very happy for her.


  * She has a close knit group of friends and they go camping and swimming outdoors,
  often skinny dipping. They have a trip to Hawaii in a week with a lot of camping
  and outdoor activities. I won''t unfortunately be able to join them.


  * Considering that she''s now in a steady relationship and she confessed that one
  of her friends had expressed his feelings for her and they''d been in a fling for
  a while (but never went anywhere) I thought she shouldn''t be doing anything that
  adds any tension to the group.


  * She thinks it''s long in the past (less than 3 years) and shouldn''t be an issue
  and that me insisting on what she does is somewhat controlling.


  * I think it''s just common sense and I can express my discomfort can''t I? I also
  worry she''s getting carried away with how well her exercise and diet regimen has
  paid off.


  Simple question folks: AITA?'
title: AITA for telling my gf that she shouldn't go skinny dipping with her friend's
  group, especially because it's mixed gender and she told me how one of her friends
  had a crush on her (not anymore allegedly).
