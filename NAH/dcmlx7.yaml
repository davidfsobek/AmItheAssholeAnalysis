selftext: 'This all happened today. I am 18F and babysit a 2 year old girl, I''ll
  call her Bailey in this post. Every afternoon Bailey and I go to the park, walk
  through town, look at books at the library, walk home. The park is by the high school
  where my boyfriend 17M goes. He normally has football practice in the afternoon
  but today I knew he was walking to an appointment after school. I texted him that
  Bailey and I were at the park if he''d like to say hello on his way by (he''s heard
  about her a lot). He stopped by for about five minutes. The three of us played on
  the swings and slides like normal and then he had to get to his appointment and
  Bailey and I kept playing.


  When Bailey and I got home from our walk her mom said to me, "Tell me about your
  afternoon." I gave her the recap but did not mention seeing my bf as it was an inconsequential
  five minutes of a five hour shift with Bailey. She then said, "I drove by the park
  today and saw a man playing with you and my daughter. Please explain." I told her
  the exact truth: "My boyfriend was walking by the park on his way downtown and stopped
  by for a couple of minutes. He has little siblings and is great with kids. We were
  never anywhere private with Bailey, just in public at the park." She asked, "Did
  you tell him to come there?" I told her that I did let him know we were there.


  She then told me to leave. On my walk home I got a text saying "Thank you for your
  time with Bailey. We no longer require your services."


  Clearly to her I did something wrong. I am embarrassed by how this played out but
  I am not positive what to think overall. AITA in this situation? My boyfriend is
  a minor, not even a grown man, and he wouldn''t hurt a fly. Also I would never invite
  my bf or anybody else into Bailey''s home nor take Bailey into anyone else''s home.
  I fully value her safety. I am totally willing to be wrong here and obviously this
  is a learning experience but I want to get some outside commentary. Thanks.


  Edit: I did not know I would get in trouble and did not omit it on purpose. If I
  had known Bailey''s mother was in a car across the street I still would have let
  my bf stop by for a couple minutes on his direct route. And I would have introduced
  them because he''s a great guy (football team, Big Brother program volunteer, I
  would even recommend him as a backup sitter because he watches his young siblings
  all the time.)


  Another edit: This is a small, pleasant weather town (hence the walking everywhere).
  Bailey and I run into friends and family all the time when we are out. Didn''t think
  to mention seeing bf because it''s completely ordinary in our town to see people.
  I keep seeing in the comments that I was let go for lying but did NOT lie to her/omit
  in order to avoid trouble.'
