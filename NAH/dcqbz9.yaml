selftext: "My son is in his last year of high school and Sept 2020 will be starting\
  \ Uni.  My wedding date is set for May 2020 (not to my son dad's , we separated\
  \ when my son was 9)\n\nMy son wants me to postpone my wedding date so when he applies\
  \ for Uni funding so I'll still be a single parent. \n\nI have the venue, caterer,\
  \ bartender booked for the wedding.  \n\nI feel my son is being a bit entitled,\
  \ I'll the do the best I can to help him with fees,and I do have an RESP set up\
  \ so he has about 70 - 80 % of the money he will need for first year already.\n\n\
  He doesn't see the big deal in me moving up my wedding date to accommodate him.\
  \  I don't really think it's my sole responsibility to fund his university, he should\
  \ foot some of the cost as well.\n\nJust a note : his birth father comes and goes\
  \ in his life, but by has provided no support to him or me financial or otherwise\
  \ since we've been apart.\n\nEdit. This is my first time on Reddit so I did respond\
  \ but not sure if people can see it. \n\nI really appreciate all the feedback. Seems\
  \ like I'm 50% the asshole \n\nI do have 15,000k in an education fund for him and\
  \ I did tell him I would pay the rest for year 1.  \n\nI stick by my entitled comment.\
  \ I would never expect my parents to alter their life for me. I feel like he expects\
  \ this. \n\nThese comments have given me things to think about which is what I was\
  \ looking for. \n\nThanks all !"
