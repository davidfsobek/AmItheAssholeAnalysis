selftext: "This happened a few months ago and every time I take an Uber (8-10 times\
  \ a week) I'm still dumbfounded by the experience and wondering what happened here.\
  \ Relevant intro - I look young, but not that young - I'm in my early 30's, maybe\
  \ could pass for early 20's but pretty clearly not a teenager. \n\nI use Uber to\
  \ go to work 3-4 times a week, and this morning was one of those mornings. Driver\
  \ (\\~mid 50's male?) pulls up outside of my house, I walk outside, open the door,\
  \ say \"Hi \\_\\_\\_ how's it going\" and he just turns around and says \"How old\
  \ are you?\". I was a little taken back since that's a pretty odd way to respond\
  \ to \"how's it going\", so I responded with \"I'm sorry?\" and he repeated himself.\
  \ I asked him why he needed to know how old I was, and he told me he needed to make\
  \ sure that I was old enough to ride in an Uber. I told him I was old enough to\
  \ ride in an Uber, and he responded by telling me that if I wouldn't share how old\
  \ I was with him that he wasn't comfortable driving me so I told him that's fine\
  \ and got out of the car and called a different Uber. \n\nAITA for not just resolving\
  \ this situation by telling this guy my age?"
