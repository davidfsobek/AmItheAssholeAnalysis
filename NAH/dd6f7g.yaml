selftext: 'Throwaway since GF knows my account


  So my girlfriend (F24) and I (M25) have recently moved in together and she uses
  a reusable period cup for when her time of the month comes. Today I saw it sitting
  on the stove in one of the pots that we both (+ other flatmate) use for cooking,
  simmering away to sterilise it before use. I''m not repulsed by her using a cup
  or anything, but I do think it''s kinda gross that she uses a cooking pot for her
  cup. She says she washes it before she puts it in there, but I definitely saw some...
  red marks.


  When I tried to ask politely if she would consider buying a new pot to sterilise
  her cup, she got mad at me saying that it''s unnecessary because it''s being sterilised
  and this way it''s way better for the environment. I told her I don''t like that
  it''s a pot we use for cooking, but now she''s not speaking to me for ''not respecting
  for bodily needs''.


  Am I the asshole?'
