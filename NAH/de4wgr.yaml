selftext: "So me, my dad and his partner went to Crete this summer.\n\nA few days\
  \ into our vacation we decided to go to Balos. To arrive there you need to to walk\
  \ down from the mountain by foot.  Going back up was the problem. It was nearly\
  \ 40 degrees hot. I instantly started to hyperventilate and had do stop several\
  \ times. At one point my dad had to throw water on my face because I was about to\
  \ faint. During all of this my dad was very irritated. After a while I got some\
  \ bad stomachache as well.  \n\nAfter about 40 minutes we reach our car and I finally\
  \ understand my stomachache. My bathing suit was *soaked* in blood.  I felt humiliated\
  \ and i told my dad I wanted to go back to the apartment. But dad and Stefy (his\
  \ partner) ignored me and started arguing if they wanted do go to another city or\
  \ go back home. Thankfully we went home.\n\nDuring that time, I burned my whole\
  \ body too. So, after I showered, I told my dad and partner that I wouldn't be going\
  \ out to dinner with them.  Stefy immediately said that i was ruining the mood of\
  \ the vacation. I raised my voice replying that she cared more about me \"ruining\
  \ the vacation\" then me being sick. She snapped back not to talk to her with that\
  \ tone and my dad said the same. I replied i wasnt going and went into my room.\
  \ Before they went I begged my dad to please get something for my burns: at first\
  \ he said it wasn't that serious, then he said yes but only if I paid for it with\
  \ my own money. I was pissed he was treating it like a luxury item, but I agreed.\
  \ He didn't get it that evening.\n\nNight passes without sleep from how badly my\
  \ skin burned. In the morning I asked if we could stop at a pharmacy. We did and\
  \ I finally got some aloe vera gel for my skin. Then we briefly stopped at a beach\
  \ but I had to stay clothed and under the beach umbrella not to irritate my skin\
  \ further. So after we go home i say that I prefer to stay home and rest instead\
  \ of going out. Stefy snaps, saying again that I'm ruining everything and that I\
  \ want to stay home just because I want to use my phone and that she doesn't want\
  \ me in the next vacation. I stand my ground and say that we'll go out in the evening\
  \ anyway. They leave and I rest.\n\nStefy was mad at me *again* the day after because\
  \ I asked her to bring her own pantyliners because I finished mine (i was still\
  \ leaking blood). She said i can't do anything for myself and i need to grow up\
  \ (I'm 18). All day she was snappy and irritated, my dad said nothing about her\
  \ behavior.\n\nI feel hurt by what happened. He always acts like im faking in how\
  \ much pain I am. And he does that with my mental health too: he called me lazy\
  \ and a liar even after I started taking antidepressants.\n\nSo, WIBTA if I stopped\
  \ seeing him? I know he loves me, he choose Crete exactly because he knows I love\
  \ Greece But I can't deny that he's not that great at taking care of me. Maybe he'll\
  \ finally understand that he needs to become a better dad."
