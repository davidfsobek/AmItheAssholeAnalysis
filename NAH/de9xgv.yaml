selftext: "My (30F) 11-year-old daughter is on her third round of vegetarianism and\
  \ I\u2019m at my wit\u2019s end.\n\nShe has declared herself a vegetarian twice\
  \ before and ended it suddenly a couple weeks in when she wanted to eat something\
  \ non-vegetarian. In general, our household rule is that what\u2019s made for dinner\
  \ is the only option and no special accommodations are made, but the lady two times\
  \ I did try to make it easier for her by adjusting dinner for her.\n\nNeedless to\
  \ say it was annoying when she decided she wasn\u2019t vegetarian for food she really\
  \ liked. So when she came home from school and said \u201Cguess what? I\u2019m a\
  \ vegetarian again!\u201D I told her point blank I\u2019m making no special accommodations\
  \ she will be in charge of her vegetarianism.\n\nIt\u2019s been about a week and\
  \ she\u2019s complaining of stomach pain. I keep our house stocked with healthy\
  \ food, but just recently I have thrown away a bag of wilted lettuce, a barely touched\
  \ container of hummus, like four bananas and apples are rotting on the counter as\
  \ we speak. She chooses foods like popcorn, chips, muffins, etc. We had this same\
  \ problem over the summer when I allowed her to prepare her own lunches. We ended\
  \ up at the dr and it was confirmed her extremely poor diet is the problem. I told\
  \ her today she has to go back to eating our dinners, meat and all, because she\u2019\
  s not capable of making her own healthy choices. I told her I can\u2019t let her\
  \ make herself sick and if she doesn\u2019t start eating with the family I\u2019\
  m taking away her phone and other privileges.\n\nShe told me it\u2019s my fault\
  \ for not providing healthy vegetarian options. On one hand, I want to support her\
  \ in her beliefs. On the other hand, I feel like vegetarianism is very much a trend\
  \ she\u2019s trying and I don\u2019t have the time and energy to make it happen.\n\
  \nAlso, I should add that she is a 6th grade girl with a really bad attitude at\
  \ times which is normal, and I\u2019m 8 months pregnant with my fourth child and\
  \ out of patience and energy currently. I\u2019m sure these contribute to the tension.\n\
  \nAITA?\n\nETA: I should have mentioned we encourage healthy eating, provide home\
  \ cooked healthy meals nearly every night (some vegetarian, some not) and she has\
  \ been taught how to do basic cooking and we are willing to buy ingredients and\
  \ foods that are healthy and vegetarian for her. What I\u2019m not willing to accommodate\
  \ is cooking any separate food items for her at dinner time. I accept many people\
  \ consider me TA for not helping her and taking her wishes more seriously.\n\nWhat\
  \ I\u2019m struggling to accept is the number of people telling me I\u2019m TA because\
  \ I have too many kids, I let my kids eat muffins sometimes, or saying I\u2019m\
  \ neglectful and willing to let her be malnourished or that it\u2019s my fault because\
  \ I haven\u2019t taught her to cook and don\u2019t teach my kids about nutrition.\
  \ That\u2019s all stuff that\u2019s being inferred without any proof.\n\nEdit #2:\
  \ It's been ruled NAH, but for the people still commenting ITA in regards to not\
  \ investing that time and energy in her request, I see your point. For people saying\
  \ I'm neglecting my child or suggesting that I don't even like her, please stop.\
  \ Seriously. I'm a real mother who is trying her best and I absolutely love and\
  \ adore my child. I understand I came to the internet looking for advice and opinions,\
  \ but accusing somebody of not liking their child or malnourishing their child is\
  \ so toxic and really does hurt the invisible people reading your comments."
