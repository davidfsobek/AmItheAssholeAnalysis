selftext: " My company took my team to another city for a week for a conference. It\
  \ was an extended trip with a lot of free time, so we all did some fun things too\
  \ and the trip turned out to be half work/half vacation. There is no beach in the\
  \ city where I usually live, so I suggested that we all go to the beach one afternoon.\
  \ At the beach, I stripped down to a bikini to sunbathe and go swimming. After I\
  \ did that, a coworker pulled me aside and said that what I was wearing was inappropriate,\
  \ that even though we had gone to the beach during the afternoon for fun, we had\
  \ gone together as a team of colleagues and that we should not be dressed so \"\
  unprofessionally\". \n\nI did not take him seriously, and just blew him off, I had\
  \ a lot of fun that day at the beach. However things have escalated at work now,\
  \ there have been complaints lodged about my lack of professionalism and inability\
  \ to take criticism and change. Complaints have been lodged with hr and my boss\
  \ right now. It is worth noting that none of the others were wearing a bikini, they\
  \ were dressed way more conservatively, even at the beach. AITA?\n\nEdit : A lot\
  \ of the guys were wearing swim shorts and no shirt or just a pair of boxers. I\
  \ don't know how that is appropriate, but I'm not? All the women were wearing more\
  \ clothes though, not even just bathing suits. The women were wearing t shirts/shirts\
  \ with longish shorts/capris/pants. It is generally the women in my company who\
  \ are conservative, but idk why this guy (who was very professionally dressed in\
  \ just a pair of Jean's shorts) took it up on himself to instigate this"
