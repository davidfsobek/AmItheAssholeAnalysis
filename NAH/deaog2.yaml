selftext: 'Salutations. Recently, we had a test in my history class. Usually, a large
  portion of the test is multiple choice. Knowing this I searched for a quizlet and
  found the questions and answers my teacher uses on the test. Long story short I
  missed 5 points which was the best grade in the class, so I set the curve on the
  test. My friends are mad at me for setting the curve and lowering their scores.
  However, I think I deserved my grade and didnt cheat. With classes and my job I
  did not have to time to use more traditional methods of studying. AITA for using
  my resources?


  Edit: Since most of you are calling me the asshole, I''m going to be talking to
  my teacher and I will accept my punishment. Be on the lookout for an update tomorrow.
  Wish me luck.'
