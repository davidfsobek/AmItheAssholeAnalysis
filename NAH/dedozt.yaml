selftext: "My husband and I host parties with our friends a few times a year.  During\
  \ the last two parties, our friend \u201CCraig\u201D has knocked his drink over.\n\
  \nThe first time, the drink in question was blue (I make a mean blue margarita).\
  \   It made a helluva mess.  It was late (around 1:30 a.m.), and my husband and\
  \ I were really pissed (although we hid it as best we could).  We were super tired,\
  \ and cleaning that blue shit off our carpet was the last thing we felt like doing.\n\
  \nThe second time was last night.    This time, it was an almost full rum and coke.\
  \    The mess wasn\u2019t as terrible to clean up, but this time the glass was almost\
  \ full, so it covered our table, carpet, AND MY PHONE.   Luckily, my phone survived,\
  \ and we were abele to clean everything up.\n\nBoth times, Craig expressed dismay,\
  \ helped clean up, but didn\u2019t say he was sorry for the mess.   Frankly, that\
  \ pissed me and my husband off.\n\nThis morning, I looked online and found a collection\
  \ of spill proof adult sippy cups for sale.  There would be enough for my husband,\
  \ me, Craig, his wife, and the other two friends who usually come to our parties.\
  \    Would I be the asshole if I bought them and used them at the next party?  I\
  \ could say \u201CHey, people sometimes get a little clumsy when they\u2019ve had\
  \ a few.   Believe me, I\u2019ve been there.   These will prevent any possible future\
  \ mishaps!\u201D\n\nCraig will undoubtedly know that I\u2019ve bought them because\
  \ of him.   I don\u2019t want to make him feel bad, but I also don\u2019t want our\
  \ carpets to suffer again.    So, WIBTA?\n\nEdit:   Lots of conflicting opinions!\
  \   \n\nOne thing I\u2019ve been asked, repeatedly, was why I wanted an apology\
  \ when Craig helped clean up.    Good point - I guess I wanted one because if **I**\
  \ had accidentally dumped a full glass of soda on Craig\u2019s carpet and phone,\
  \ I\u2019d probably still be apologizing, days later.   (I\u2019m Canadian, in case\
  \ you hadn\u2019t guessed!).  At the very least, I\u2019d call him and ask \u201C\
  Is your phone okay?   How\u2019s the carpet?   If there\u2019s any permanent damage,\
  \ please let me know, and I\u2019ll pay to fix it.\u201D"
