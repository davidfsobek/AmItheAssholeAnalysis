selftext: "I (53M) have grown increasingly worried about my daughter's (22F) weight.\
  \ It has gotten beyond the point of merely an aesthetic issue, and I have genuine\
  \ concerns about her health.\n\nShe doesn't live at home, as she recently started\
  \ graduate school out of town. Our arrangement is that I pay for her tuition and\
  \ rent, and she has a part time job that covers groceries, utility bills, spending\
  \ money, etc. This works out well as I am happy to cover these expenses since she\
  \ is in school. However, she often says that she wishes she earned more money, since\
  \ she does not have a ton of spending money for leisure activities, clothes, etc.\n\
  \nI have tried to speak to her about her weight, approaching it as delicately as\
  \ I could. She was actually quite receptive, and I could tell she was a bit hurt\
  \ but she told me that she knew it was an issue that she should be addressing. However,\
  \ currently she is not sufficiently motivated to do it, and is busy with her school\
  \ and part time job so struggles to find time to go to the gym. \n\nI suggested\
  \ that if she started going to the gym, I would give her extra money. This is to\
  \ serve as a motivator, but also for practical reasons as she can pick up fewer\
  \ shifts at her job and have more time to go to the gym.\n\nThe deal is $15 per\
  \ hour spent at the gym. This is working on an honour system since I trust her,\
  \ and I did not think it would be appropriate to pay her by pounds lost (could encourage\
  \ unhealthy eating and so on). My wife thinks this is a \"disgusting\" idea, but\
  \ I think I am helping her by replacing her shifts at her job with \"shifts\" at\
  \ the gym - and financially compensating this.\n\nSo, AITA for paying for my daughter\
  \ to lose weight?\n\n**EDIT:** A lot of comments about how her diet is the most\
  \ important thing, rather than exercise. Which is definitely fair. We did also speak\
  \ about her diet, but her lack of exercise is the facet that had the most clear\
  \ barrier (lack of time and motivation) which is why that is what I am addressing.\
  \ Hopefully her diet will improve as well, especially since she should have some\
  \ extra money in her pockets for more expensive groceries from this arrangement."
