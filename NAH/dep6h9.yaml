selftext: "The kid was honest and told me her parents would not give her the money\
  \ to go on some weekend trip with her friends.  I told the girl it's time you started\
  \ earning your own money so you don't have to ask your parents every time you want\
  \ to do something that costs.  Then I told her that right now I'm getting ready\
  \ to mow my lawn and told her I'd give her $50 in a heartbeat if I could go sit\
  \ my butt down and take a nap.  She agreed and I showed her how to cut the mower\
  \ on and off.  I did tell her to go take off her flip flops and put on some shoes.\
  \  She got the job done in about 2 hours and I gave her the $50 as promised.\n\n\
  &#x200B;\n\nThis morning I'm going out to my car and her father is in my driveway\
  \ with words for me.  His wife is standing across the street giving me the mean\
  \ look.  I really don't have time for this.  So I keep my mouth shut and listen\
  \ till he says what he's gotta say then I leave for work.  AITA for letting his\
  \ 16F daughter mow my lawn for $50 bucks?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAdding edits as recommended\
  \ by other Reddit Members.\n\nEdit\\*\n\nWhat did he say?\n\n\"He was saying something\
  \ about how dare I interfere with his family by giving her money after they refused\
  \ to give it to her.  He was all pissed off talking about she could have gotten\
  \ hurt using my mower.  I did not say a word in return.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit\\\
  *\\*\n\nI'd like to note kids come knocking on my door during the winter to shovel\
  \ the sidewalk. Never had any issues paying them to clear the snow. I honestly thought\
  \ I was helping.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit\\*\\*\\*\n\n We have been neighbors for over\
  \ 18 years. My kid use to baby sit this girl at their house before she went off\
  \ to college. We don't have dinner together or anything like that, but they paid\
  \ my daughter when she babysat for this girl when she was a toddler. So yeah they\
  \ know me as a neighbor."
