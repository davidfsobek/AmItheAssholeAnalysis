selftext: "My daughter is a high school senior is in the process of applying to colleges.\
  \ She was procrastinating and panicking about applying to her number one choice.\
  \ I thought she had a very good chance of getting in. To motivate her I applied\
  \ as a joke kinda as the application fee was waived for me and raced her, but still\
  \ not rushing her to make sure her application and essays were top notch. We both\
  \ applied at similar times. I got my acceptance letter and told my daughter that\
  \ if I got accepted then she's a shoe-in. Then my daughter got her rejection letter.\
  \ My wife and I consoled her, but she was very upset. Me applying and getting accepted\
  \ certainly didn't help. We helped her apply to other colleges and are still waiting\
  \ to hear back from them. Then I got email from the admissions office saying that\
  \ I qualified for their unique student program and would have tuition waived. Now\
  \ I'm seriously considering going to college. \nI took a gap year after high school\
  \ where my wife (girlfriend then) got pregnant while she was in school. I decided\
  \ to enter the workforce and take care of my daughter (the same one) while my wife\
  \ attended college. My wife graduated and got a well paying job while I worked an\
  \ entry level job and did some \"stay-at-home dad\" work. I still work my job and\
  \ we could definitely survive off my wife's income, but I work to keep myself busy.\
  \ I don't hate my job, but I don't love it and it's not what I imagined myself doing.\
  \ I think this opportunity to go to college would be great for not only me, but\
  \ my whole family. Ideally, my income with my degree would be much greater than\
  \ it is now. The college is in commuting distance so I wouldn't have to get an apartment.\
  \ I talked to my wife about it and she's unsure. She said it'd be great for me to\
  \ go to college, but it'd be rude of me to attend the college that rejected our\
  \ daughter. \nWIBTA if I attended the college that rejected my daughter?"
