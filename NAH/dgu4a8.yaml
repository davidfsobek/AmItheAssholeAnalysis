selftext: "Using a throw away \n\nI come from a very close family. I have an older\
  \ sister with 2 kids (7F, 10M), wife is an only child (don\u2019t know if that\u2019\
  s important). My sister lives 30 minutes from me so I\u2019ve seen her kids at least\
  \ once a week since the day they were born. I am also their godfather. they\u2019\
  re a huge part of my life. \n\nA few days ago wife shows me a picture of a woman\
  \ on the street holding a sign asking for help for her child\u2019s medical bills.\
  \ I said something like \u201Cthat must be a horrible feeling. I can\u2019t imagine\
  \ what I would do if son, niece and nephew were sick and I couldn\u2019t do a thing\u201D\
  \ and I thought that was the end of that. \n\nA few seconds later she goes \u201C\
  why would niece and nephew be your problem?\u201D I said in kind of a \u201Cduh!\u201D\
  \  way \u201Cuh because they\u2019re my family and I love them as much as my son\u201D\
  . That just set her off and she started telling me how my son should be more important\
  \ than niece and nephew and that they have their own parents etc. After a few minutes\
  \ of it I had enough and i told her \u201CI love those kids and I would take a bullet\
  \ for any of them so just leave it\u201D stood up and locked myself in my home office.\
  \ \n\nMy wife would make passive aggressive comments every now and then so I tried\
  \ explaining my side again but she insists a father should love his children more,\
  \ no ifs ands or buts. I disagree. \n\nI don\u2019t plan to bring it up again but\
  \ if she does I will fight it  until I turn blue in the face. AITA here?"
