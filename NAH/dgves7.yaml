selftext: "Alright everyone, I need some judgement on this one...\n\nMy wife and I\
  \ have a happy, healthy (no chonkers) cat that we love except for on weekends when\
  \ he will sit outside our bedroom door and meow non stop until one of us gets up\
  \ to feed him. This only happens on weekends.\n\nMonday-Friday my wife wakes up\
  \ for work first at around 6:00 am and feeds the cat. However on weekends we both\
  \ try to sleep in, so come 6:01 am our kitty alarm clock goes off and won't shut\
  \ up until one of us gets up to feed him. He will literally cry for 2 hours straight\
  \ if we try to ignore him.\n\nHere's where the story takes a twist. Awhile back\
  \ we bought a timed self feeder to use when we are away for vacations. When we tested\
  \ out the self feeder we discovered the amazing benefit of the cat no longer crying\
  \ to us for food because he gets fed at his usual time each morning. I thought this\
  \ was fabulous and we should use the self feeder all the time to save our sleep\
  \ sanity.\n\nMy wife disagreed. Her reasons range from:\n\nConcerned that the self\
  \ feeder might not drop the correct amount of food each time.\n\nConcerned the cat\
  \ might be able to reach his little murder mitten up the food chute and steal extra\
  \ food between meals.\n\nConcerned the cat won't \"love\" us anymore since we aren't\
  \ the ones directly pouring his food into his dish.\n\nConcerned it's a waste of\
  \ batteries.\n\nI've told my wife I understand all of her concerns but I still think\
  \ the benefit of being able to sleep in without being woken up by a cat banshee\
  \ outweighs the risks she has laid out. She still disagrees.\n\nSo I did the only\
  \ thing that reddit hates more in relationships than cheating and gave my wife an\
  \ ULTIMATUM! \n\nI told her that we either use the self-feeder or come 6:01 am Saturday\
  \ morning when the cat wakes us both up, I'm kicking her (not litterally) out of\
  \ bed to go feed the damn cat.\n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nEDIT: I'm seeing a lot of\
  \ people proposing the compromise of using the self feeder just on weekends. Unfortunately\
  \ my wife has shot that idea down in the past too.\n\nEDIT 2: Many people have been\
  \ demanding I pay the \"cat tax\" and post a picture of the real AH in question.\
  \ Sadly I am a Reddit failure and can't figure out how to attach a picture to the\
  \ post. If anyone knows how to do this and can direct message me, I will gladly\
  \ comply and pay the cat tax.\n\nEDIT 3: Hopefully this works...\n\nMy little AH\
