selftext: "This is my first time posting anything but I enjoy reading thing sub often\
  \ so hopefully I got everything right.\n\nSo, before anyone asks, I (27F) don't\
  \ drink. My fianc\xE9 (27M) also doesn't drink. We don't have any sort of history\
  \ with alcohol that would make it detrimental to have alcohol around us. We aren't\
  \ religious either. I have just never drank because I don't see the appeal of it,\
  \ and though my fianc\xE9 has drank in the past, it was less than five times ever\
  \ and all while we were in college. Our immediate families also do not drink, but\
  \ our extended families have people that do. A lot of our friends, however, do drink.\
  \ \n\nWith all that, while we were planning our wedding, we went in with the assumption\
  \ that there would be no alcohol. We just don't feel like it would be fun to be\
  \ surrounded by drunk people at our own reception. Basically everyone close to us\
  \ is aware that we don't drink, but now I'm concerned that there might be people\
  \ coming (SOs of friends, family we see less often, etc.) that aren't aware of it\
  \ and they might be offended. We really don't want people to bring alcohol or try\
  \ to sneak it in (our venue isn't dry but you have to pay more if you want alcohol\
  \ to be allowed and we aren't planning on doing that - however we could easily afford\
  \ it so it is not a financial issue). In terms of things that don't require alcohol,\
  \ we will have performances by dancers but most of the other activities are for\
  \ the kids. We aren't having a dance floor because neither of us are big party people\
  \ and we'd rather people spend the time talking. Everyone we are inviting except\
  \ plus ones knows multiple people coming.\n\nThe reason I am questioning this is\
  \ because my fianc\xE9 was talking to his best man (a pretty heavy drinker) and\
  \ he insisted that people would be weirded out by the lack of drinks and that it\
  \ would cause people to have less fun. There are a decent amount of people flying\
  \ in for this wedding because both of our families are spread out around the globe.\
  \ I really don't want them to come so far and not enjoy themselves! On the other\
  \ hand, this is ultimately our wedding and both o us would be less happy if there\
  \ was alcohol served.\n\nSo, AITA for not serving alcohol at our wedding?\n\nTL;DR:\
  \ We aren't serving alcohol and we don't have any real strong reason. Are we assholes?"
