selftext: "I own a restaurant and we\u2019re across the street from a lot of medical\
  \ offices, including a fairly large children\u2019s oncology clinic. \n\nWhenever\
  \ a family with a child from the oncology clinic comes into the restaurant I\u2019\
  ve let the servers know their food should be put ahead of all the other orders.\
  \ \n\nThose families have usually either had a long, difficult day or are celebrating\
  \ a major victory, and in any case I don\u2019t want to keep them waiting. \n\n\
  Recently a customer approached me and said \u201CI  notice what you do with the\
  \ kids with cancer and their families and it\u2019s a nice thought to do once in\
  \ a while if they\u2019re clearly in a rush or having a bad day, but I come here\
  \ every week while my husband is in treatment across the way and I\u2019ve never\
  \ gotten priority service. Half the time I come here my food gets held up, and I\u2019\
  m a loyal paying customer! I know you have good intentions but it\u2019s really\
  \ rude to the rest of us.\u201D\n\nNow I\u2019m worried I\u2019ve been an asshole\
  \ to my other customers or that there\u2019s dissatisfaction brewing and they feel\
  \ they can\u2019t say anything because of the sensitive nature of the topic. AITA?"
