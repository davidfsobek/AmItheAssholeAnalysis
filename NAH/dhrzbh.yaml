selftext: "Hear me out, I know this sounds fake.\n\nMy (23f) dad works a program in\
  \ which he gives support (food, money, resources, etc) to people who have just come\
  \ out of prison and need help. He has done this for as long as I can remember, and\
  \ I've been helping since I was about 16. We meet a lot of different people from\
  \ different walks of life, and the service also acts as a support group where we\
  \ all talk. I met Anna (25f) when she was 22 and she'd just been released from prison\
  \ for some drug charges. She was put in prison right after she turned 18. She told\
  \ me that because she was so young, she was pushed around a lot in prison. She was\
  \ basically forced into a prison tattoo of a swastika, because a group of women\
  \ were threatening her life if she didn't. I believe her story is true and have\
  \ no reason to doubt her. \n\nAnna has struggled since getting out of prison and\
  \ simply does not have the money to cover the tattoo, nor does she know what she\
  \ would cover it with. It is right on her chest, so is hard to hide. I know she\
  \ is embarrassed about the tattoo and she hides it with sweaters and high neck shirts.\
  \ I've seen her try to cover it with make up, but you can still see it.\n\nShe came\
  \ to me when I announced my engagement and said it would probably be the only time\
  \ she would have the tattoo visible, because it is a wedding in the summer (next\
  \ year) and it will be too hot to hide. I didn't really know what to say at the\
  \ time. It's going to be a large wedding. I can safely assume there will be some\
  \ people offended by it (I mean, it makes me feel a bit sick but I try to look past\
  \ it). \n\nI really don't know what to do. I don't want to hurt her feelings or\
  \ make her feel more ashamed than she is, but I also (selfishly) don't want this\
  \ to be the focus of the wedding, or for any guests to be offended. I'm seriously\
  \ considering making her a member of my bridal party simply so I can pick dresses\
  \ that will cover it without singling her out. Anna is a really good person now\
  \ and I don't want to hurt her. My brother, when I told him, said that if she had\
  \ a giant distracting birth mark, I wouldn't expect her to cover it, so why would\
  \ I expect her to with this. I feel awful and am genuinely conflicted. I don't want\
  \ to body shame her but also can't have that at my wedding.\n\nWIBTA, or is this\
  \ reasonable?"
title: WIBTA if I told my friend she had to cover her swastika tattoo to come to my
  wedding?
