selftext: "My son broke his nose when he was 7, because of that his nose became kinda\
  \ crooked,it\u2019s not extremely noticeable, but he was really really insecure\
  \ about that. \n\nHe started getting into modeling about year and a half ago. Lots\
  \ of people advised him to get a nose job. He has asked me about it before that\
  \ too, but after he heard people\u2019s advices he said he wanted to get surgery\
  \ 100%. I talked to him and told him that he doesn\u2019t need a surgery, he\u2019\
  s already pretty successful at his job for 16 y.o, but he told me that it wasn\u2019\
  t even about his job, he just wanted to do it for himself.\n\nSo, I thought about\
  \ it more and I told him that I\u2019ll let him get the surgery when  he turns 17(in\
  \ 4 months). \n\nI told my brother about it randomly. He had a bad reaction. He\
  \ said that I should be telling him that he doesn\u2019t need to \u201Cfix\u201D\
  \ anything, and that I\u2019m doing such a horrible job as a parent for making my\
  \ son even more insecure and letting him alter his appearance. \n\nI started doubting\
  \ myself after that."
