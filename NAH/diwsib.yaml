selftext: My gf and I have been dating for a while and recently have been talking
  about engagement. We've been discussing some things. She had a odd request for me
  recently. To ask her younger brother for his blessing. Obviously I will ask her
  dad, but her younger brother? My gf and I have a 9 year age difference and her brother
  is nearly 15 years younger than me. I'm 34, he's 20. I thought she was joking, but
  she was serious. She's American....grew up in the south. She even thought her brother
  might be joking, but didn't know and wanted me to ask him anyways. Lol. I told her
  NO. She seemed a little disappointed....says her little brother is really important
  to her/ she really wants him to like me, etc.  I thought it was silly and thought
  he had to be joking.  I've always believed to ask elders for blessings. AITA for
  refusing to ask her younger brother for his blessing?
