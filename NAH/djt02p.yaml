selftext: "My son had a friend over today. \n\nWhen the mom of the other kid dropped\
  \ him off I said \u201CLooks like we\u2019re going to the movies. Is that all still\
  \ fine?\u201D\n\nWe\u2019d discussed it beforehand because initially the boys were\
  \ going to skate but my son\u2019s getting over a knee injury and  he decided he\
  \ wasn\u2019t feeling ready to get back on the ice yet. \n\nI said \u201CWe\u2019\
  re going to [local theater] should be back by 6:00 depending on what the boys want\
  \ to see.\u201D She said fine. \n\nThe boys mess around in the yard for a while\
  \ then they\u2019re ready to go. I ask what they want to see, they say they want\
  \ to see the Will Smith movie Gemini Man. Great. \n\nWe go, we watch. Wasn\u2019\
  t a great movie, but they had fun. We get back, mom picks up the kid, asks him how\
  \ the movie was, he tells her all about it. She gets a weird look on her face. I\
  \ don\u2019t really think much of it at the time. \n\nLater that night I get a pissy\
  \ phone call about exposing her son to all that violence and why would I take him\
  \ to a PG-13 movie when he\u2019s only 11 (12 next month, but whatever, I don\u2019\
  t argue with her.) \n\nI say \u201Cif you\u2019d let me know when you dropped him\
  \ off that he could only see PG movies I absolutely would\u2019ve abides by that\u201D\
  \ and she says \u201CHe\u2019s 11 and the movie was rated for 13 year olds, I shouldn\u2019\
  t need to tell you not to bring him! It\u2019s common sense!\u201D \n\nI don\u2019\
  t think it is. I think those ratings are arbitrary and outdated and if that\u2019\
  s what she wanted she should\u2019ve told me. \n\nBut now I\u2019m starting to have\
  \ misgivings. I asked my mom and my sister got both gave me opposite answers. Any\
  \ thoughts?\n\nEdit: Added that it was Gemini Man, sorry that\u2019s an important\
  \ detail to have left out."
