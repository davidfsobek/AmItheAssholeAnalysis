selftext: "So the title kind of says it all. \n\nMy 16 year old son came to me panicked\
  \ and said his 16 year old boyfriend just told him he (the boyfriend) was HIV positive.\
  \ I told him to stay calm and no matter what everything was going to be fine (inside\
  \ I was more panicked than he was) we immediately drove and got him (my son)  tested.\
  \ He\u2019s negative (my son is negative, but his boyfriend is positive.)\n\nMy\
  \ son says  boyfriend didn\u2019t lie or neglect to tell him, he only just found\
  \ out himself. I have no reason not to believe him. \n\nBut I still said he had\
  \ to break up with the kid. I insisted on it. My son said they\u2019d be extra cautious\
  \ and he could take PrEP and it would be fine but I told him the truth, that it\
  \ was too serious a disease for him to even slightly risk contracting at his age.\
  \ \n\nI know most people won\u2019t believe me but this has nothing to do with my\
  \ son being gay. \n\nHe\u2019s had two serious boyfriends in the past and a handful\
  \ of dates, I\u2019ve never had a problem. They\u2019d come by the house, it was\
  \ fine.  And this guy I had him break up with was a good guy. \n\nI just know my\
  \ son\u2019s maturity level and don\u2019t trust him to take all the proper precautions\
  \ to keep himself safe. If he were 30 and called and said \u201Cmy boyfriend just\
  \ said he\u2019s HIV positive but I don\u2019t want to break up with him\u201D I\u2019\
  d be by his side going to get a PrEP prescription and reading all the articles and\
  \ encouraging him to be safe because it would be his responsibility as an adult\
  \ to make these decisions for himself. \n\nRight now though, I still have to nag\
  \ him to wear a seat belt when he drives. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019d be doing\
  \ my job as a parent if he kept seeing an HIV positive person until he can protect\
  \ himself. \n\nBut my son, of course, does not agree. He says I\u2019m being discriminatory\
  \ against HIV positive people, and I just got off the phone with my brother, and\
  \ he said the same thing. That I\u2019m taking this too seriously and I was wrong\
  \ to make them break up. \n\nThat even if that\u2019s what I wanted it should\u2019\
  ve been a decision my son and I came to together after more discussion. \n\nAITA?"
