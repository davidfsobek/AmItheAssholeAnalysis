selftext: "Grew up in Texas and always had friends who spoke Spanish. Heard enough\
  \ growing up/took classes through HS to make it normal for me to say tortilla the\
  \ way my friends did (with a smol accent I suppose). \n\nI dated a girl in college\
  \ for a year that was from Melbourne, Australia. She was always on my case about\
  \ pronouncing it how they do (sounds like Mel-bun). \n\n\nAnyway to make a long\
  \ story longer, my ex always told me that I sounded pompous when saying things like\
  \ that. Now that I\u2019m out of the relationship, I\u2019m curious what other people\
  \ think. I don\u2019t want to appropriate peoples culture. Am I though?"
