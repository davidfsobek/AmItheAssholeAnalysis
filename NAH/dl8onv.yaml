selftext: "Today my daughter (6th grade) came home with an invitation to a classmate\u2019\
  s Halloween party this upcoming Friday. The invitation itself was handwritten by\
  \ the child and xeroxed, and the only RSVP included was \u201Ctext me if you can\
  \ come!\u201D with the child\u2019s phone number. No contact info at all for the\
  \ parents. I\u2019ve never heard my daughter mention this kid before, and I do not\
  \ know her parents. I asked around, and I don\u2019t know anyone else who knows\
  \ her parents, either. Furthermore, I find it very odd that the rsvp wasn\u2019\
  t the parents phone number. Who allows an 11 year old to bottom line a 5 hour party\
  \ without providing their contact information for keeping tabs on it? \n\nI told\
  \ my daughter that since I do not know this child or her parents, nor do I know\
  \ anyone who can vouch for them, I don\u2019t feel comfortable dropping her off\
  \ at their house. Bringing her and staying isn\u2019t an option, as I already have\
  \ plans for that time frame. It would be different if my daughter could tell me\
  \ other friends who would be there also, but she cannot. I\u2019m sure in all likelihood\
  \ they\u2019re perfectly nice people, but I don\u2019t operate on the honor system\
  \ when it comes to leaving my child with strangers, and I find it odd that there\
  \ is no way of contacting them ahead of time. My daughter suggested texting the\
  \ child and asking for her parent\u2019s number, but I\u2019m not interested in\
  \ doing that because I think it\u2019s bizarre that they didn\u2019t provide it\
  \ to start with and texting them isn\u2019t going to change the fact that I do not\
  \ know them. She of course thinks this is very unfair. I hate saying no and bumming\
  \ her out, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m being unreasonable considering she is\
  \ only 11. AITA?\n\nEdited to Add: I ended up sending the child a text asking for\
  \ her parent\u2019s number, and the reply was \u201Cno thank you i have to handle\
  \ the party\u201D.  Yeah that\u2019s a nope."
