selftext: "This is a hot topic in my family at the moment, \n\nI live on an obscure\
  \ little island near the UK. we have a local quiz show that\u2019s aired on the\
  \ telly that I appeared on a few years ago. \n\nThe premise of the show is that\
  \ you can win prizes for doing challenges. Some of the challenges were physical,\
  \ some psychological, and some requiring problem solving skills. I sailed through\
  \ a lot of the physical part because I wasn\u2019t a fat bastard back then, and\
  \ the problem solving skills required a lot of maths which is my career, so I was\
  \ ok there.\n\nAs for the psychological part, you had to enter a clear box \u2018\
  room\u2019 filled with something you\u2019re terrified of, and search through to\
  \ find clues to the next part. \n\nI thought of a believable lie before I entered\
  \ the show (we had to list 5 things we were afraid of) and I put down all the things\
  \ I\u2019m *not* scared of. I listed spiders, cockroaches, snakes, scorpions, and\
  \ wood lice. I literally couldn\u2019t care less about any of these creatures. I\
  \ grew up in rural landscape and I\u2019ve had to pretty much deal with creepy crawlies\
  \ my entire life so it\u2019s not an issue. My actual fear is a bit more obscure\
  \ and I really honestly knew I\u2019d fail if I was put in a room with it. \n\n\
  When I entered the room there were cockroaches *everywhere* I was in my boxers and\
  \ barefoot (which was incredibly gross I can\u2019t lie) and had to sift through\
  \ and move the cockroaches to find clues for my next challenge.\n\nI did it in the\
  \ time period ascribed to me and got through to the next part. The rest of the contestants\
  \ failed.\n\nNow, I won a pretty average car which I didn\u2019t particularly want,\
  \ so as soon as I legally could I sold it and made a nice profit since it was pretty\
  \ much brand new and bought myself a rather nicer car.\n\nI told my family this\
  \ recently on a drunken night when we were all at a get together, and although everybody\
  \ found it uproariously funny, my family are split into 2 camps- some people think\
  \ I cheated and was ethically and morally wrong, and other people think the other\
  \ contestants deserved to lose if they listed their *actual* fears.\n\nI\u2019m\
  \ obviously in the latter category, but genuinely wondering what others think."
title: AITA for lying about my biggest fear on a quiz show and subsequently winning
  a car and making other contestants lose?
