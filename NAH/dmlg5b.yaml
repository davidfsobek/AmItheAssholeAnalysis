selftext: 'So, long story short I was diagnosed with an illness that will more than
  likely kill me within a year or so. This isn''t one of those posts where I''m like,
  "I know I''ll die in exactly 48 days." It''s a bit wishy washy, but my health is
  pretty crappy however it will begin to deteriorate more where I can''t enjoy life
  in a few months. Unless I become a statistical miracle.


  So, my wife and son are taking it pretty hard. Maybe it hasn''t hit me yet because
  I''ve always been a planner. Like when life threw me punches it was more about "ok
  how can I fix this" or "let''s do something to mitigate the damage" than sulk. (I''m
  sure in 6 months my mood might shift).


  So, I told my wife I wanted to take about 60k of my retirement and just have it
  as fun money. Live as many experiences as I could before I ran out of time. We had
  our son in our mid 20s didn''t really get to travel or do much. It''s been family
  first for us for a while and my kid is 17 now we were just now planning on finally
  taking a trips to Europe and all that jazz. I told her there were some things I
  just wanted to do myself nothing that would put me life at risk(which is a joke
  in and of itself) like solo camping deep on the AT, but I did want to have some
  "me time." She seemed very upset at the idea. She didn''t tell me no but anyone
  who has been married knows when your wife wants to say no but can''t.


  I was thinking maybe a month altogether max. Not all at one time but within the
  next 3 months if my health holds up and not absolutely blowing through all the money
  but just knowing that''s my spending limit. I have a *HEALTHY* life insurance policy(house
  will be paid off, kid''s college and then some) and I''ve legitimately been family
  first my entire life. Anyone who knows me I''ve always sacrificed whatever I could
  to keep my family happy.


  I told my best friend about it and he said it was a bit of a jerk move to put that
  on my wife knowing she can''t really deny it to me.


  So.... AITA?'

  of my retirement to vacation?
