selftext: "Hi everyone! \n\nI\u2019m coming to you because I don\u2019t know how to\
  \ reason with my son anymore about college. My son is studying business and when\
  \ he applied he was very lucky be accepted to two notable business schools in Pennsylvania.\
  \ However, and I will admit this, one of the business schools is much more well\
  \ known and I guess you could say prestigious, but the other school has been rising\
  \ in national rankings and produces great careers for its students. My son was obviously\
  \ thrilled to be accepted to the former and he definitely did deserve it, and was\
  \ not as excited about the latter because he had his heart set on the more prestigious\
  \ school. However, he had applied for a nearly full ride (it covers tuition & fees,\
  \ but he has scholarships that reduced room and board) scholarship at the second\
  \ choice school and got it, which I thought was great! In a time when student debt\
  \ is a serious problem, he has an opportunity to graduate debt free from a good\
  \ school. However he still had his heart set on the \u201Cbetter\u201D school and\
  \ I did not tell him that he couldn\u2019t go there but I did tell him that I would\
  \ not pay more for it than I would have to at the school where he only had to pay\
  \ a few hundred a year. He is now enrolled at the second choice school and although\
  \ he says he likes the program and campus which does allow him to access the city\
  \ easily, he is still upset at me for what he thinks was taking away his opportunity\
  \ to attend a top school. In my opinion I think that just because a school is \u201C\
  top-tier\u201D, it doesn\u2019t outweigh the benefit of being debt free. \n\nAm\
  \ I the asshole here?"
