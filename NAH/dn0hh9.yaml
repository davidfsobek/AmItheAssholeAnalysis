selftext: "My sister A went to a few doctors because of her \u201Cheadaches.\u201D\
  \ She announced to the family that she has allergies to all fragrances, including\
  \ essential oils (??), which make her have migraines. My Mom was all crazy about\
  \ getting rid of all the products that smell in the house. She got this laundry\
  \ detergent that doesn\u2019t work great and a bunch of new shampoos and stuff.\
  \ She yelled at me to throw away all of my skin and hair care products and perfumes\
  \ because they have fragrance.\n\nI work and my passion is skin and hair care. I\
  \ bought all of these things myself with money I earned at my job. I don\u2019t\
  \ want to throw away all of my stuff because my sister has headaches sometimes.\
  \ I think they\u2019re being super unreasonable. I mean, this is hundreds of dollars\
  \ of stuff!! AITA?"
