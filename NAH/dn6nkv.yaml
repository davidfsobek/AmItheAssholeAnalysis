selftext: "I\u2019ve been engaged with my boyfriend for about 3 months now, and we\
  \ have been dating for over 3 years. I love him with all my heart, and we\u2019\
  ve gotten along super well during our relationship. \n\nOur wedding is coming up\
  \ soon, and I\u2019m super excited. When my boyfriend asked me about a wedding dress,\
  \ though, I told him that I didn\u2019t want one. I tend to dress more \u201Cboyish\u201D\
  \ and for wedding day I want to wear a tuxedo. It\u2019s simply what I prefer and\
  \ always what I\u2019ve wanted. Sure, it\u2019s not traditional, but I want to do\
  \ what pleases me.\n\nMy boyfriend does not like my idea at all. He\u2019s clearly\
  \ been displeased with my desire to wear a tuxedo. He says he\u2019s always envisioned\
  \ me in a pretty white dress on wedding day.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do at\
  \ this point. I still want to wear a tuxedo to the wedding, or something that is\
  \ not a dress.  I personally wouldn\u2019t get angry at my boyfriend if he chose\
  \ to wear something out of the norm.\n\nAm I the asshole? Should I just wear a dress\
  \ and move on from the event afterwards? I love my boyfriend and I\u2019d love to\
  \ be his wife."
