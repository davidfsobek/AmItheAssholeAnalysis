selftext: "One of my cousins, Peter just had a baby with his girlfriend a few days\
  \ ago. Peter and all his siblings all have very stunning blue eyes which they inherited\
  \ from their mom. They always get compliments on their eyes. Peter and his girlfriend\
  \ posted a picture on social media of their baby girl today saying she was born\
  \ on the 23rd and I decided to give Peter a call to congratulate him. When I called\
  \ he was with his girlfriend and the phone was on speaker. I congratulated both\
  \ of them and said their baby was gorgeous and that they\u2019ll be great parents.\
  \ I then asked Peter \u201Cdid she get your blue eyes?\u201D (in the picture they\
  \ posted on social media the eye color wasn\u2019t visible) Peter and his girlfriend\u2019\
  s tone completely changed and his girlfriend said \u201CJesus, why are you so concerned\
  \ by the eye color of my baby. It\u2019s fucking weird\u201D I was pretty taken\
  \ aback by her reaction. I didn\u2019t mean anything by it I was just curious. I\
  \ thought this was a normal conversation point. I tried to say I didn\u2019t mean\
  \ to offend her and apologize but she kinda cut me off and said they were really\
  \ busy and they had to go.\n\nI told my mom what happened and she said that Peter\u2019\
  s girlfriend is a new mom and is probably just emotional and thought I was insulting\
  \ her baby but that I didn\u2019t say anything wrong. However my sister said I was\
  \ out of line and that the fascination people have with blue eyes is weird and there\
  \ were racial implications since Peter\u2019s girlfriend is biracial (half Jamaican).\
  \ This didn\u2019t make sense to me. I never said not having blue eyes was bad.\
  \ My eyes are brown! I was just curious!\n\nAITA here?\n\nEdit: Yeah ok Peter called\
  \ our family to thank my mom for a gift and we talked a bit. I apologized again\
  \ for offending them. He accepted my apology but said his girlfriend is was really\
  \ mad at me but she\u2019ll probably calm down in a day or 2. he explained that\
  \ they\u2019ve been harassed by family members from even before the baby was born\
  \ about whether the baby would have blue eyes and his girlfriend is very annoyed\
  \ by people\u2019s fixation on eye color and feels there\u2019s some racist undertone\
  \ to it since blue eyes are \u201Cwhite features\u201D and that people think her\
  \ baby would be any less beautiful if it didn\u2019t have blue eyes. Apparently\
  \ his mom said during her pregnancy \u201Ctoo bad she probably won\u2019t have blue\
  \ eyes\u201D and his girlfriend started crying and refused to talk to her for weeks.\
  \ I feel really bad now.\nAnd he said the baby\u2019s eyes are grey."
