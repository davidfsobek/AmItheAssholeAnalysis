selftext: "This happened on a fairly crowded bus this morning as I was going to work.\
  \ I got on at my usual stop and stood next to a young black girl (maybe twelve-ish).\
  \ The kid was standing next to a white woman who was reading a book. I didn\u2019\
  t see them talk to or acknowledge each other in any way. \n\nAbout ten minutes into\
  \ the bus ride (which is now even more packed with people), I saw the girl unzip\
  \ a side compartment on the woman\u2019s backpack and start reaching inside. The\
  \ woman didn\u2019t look up from her book at all. I genuinely thought the kid was\
  \ trying to steal something from her. \n\nI tapped the girl on the shoulder and\
  \ said, \u201Cexcuse me young lady, what do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201D I\
  \ was firm, but I didn\u2019t yell. The girl said she was getting a piece of gum.\
  \ At this point, the woman snapped at me, \u201Cshe\u2019s my daughter, not a thief!\u201D\
  \ A passenger near us suggested I mind my own business.\n\nI turned bright red and\
  \ apologized profusely. I got off at the next stop and waited for another bus to\
  \ come. I feel terrible. I know I made a mistake, but was it an asshole mistake?\n\
  \nIf it matters: I\u2019m a mid-40s Asian-American. I live in an area that is primarily\
  \ white."

  a different race?
