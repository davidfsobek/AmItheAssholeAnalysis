selftext: "So this has been a thought for the better part of 2 years. I've finally\
  \ reached a point where I'm not really sure what to do. Asking reddit for judgment\
  \ on my possible decision.\n\nMy (25m) girlfriend (22f) have been dating for almost\
  \ 5 years. We love each other very much, and are doing very well for ourselves personally\
  \ and financially. In fact, we're currently in the process of buying a house. We\
  \ don't fight often, and when we do, it's always a good learning experience and\
  \ we better ourselves through it. Except for this reoccurring fight.\n\nAbout 3\
  \ years ago, she developed an intolerance for lactose. No biggie, we adjusted and\
  \ we both changed our diets to work with her. But shortly after, things got much\
  \ worse. Like IBS, but on steroids. She is literally sick and pooping 5 days out\
  \ of a normal week. She has seeked medical help, and spent a lot of money on labs\
  \ and appointments without any answers. We were both extremely disappointed and\
  \ frustrated and have been trying things to help her and her situation. She refuses\
  \ to go to the doctor, despite my constant concern. I've even offered to pay the\
  \ bill out of my own pocket. She denys and says that my money is just as important\
  \ as hers (I make 3X more).\n\n She has restricted herself to potato based meals,\
  \ crackers, and water or light sodas. Very little meat, very little veggies. It's\
  \ still unclear as to what makes her sick, but it is almost every day she complains\
  \ about her stomach, eventually ending in multiple trips to the bathroom.\n\nI can't\
  \ take her out, ever. She literally can't eat anything from restaurants, I've tried\
  \ everything from vegan to vegetarian. We were at a family gathering today, and\
  \ had to leave hours early because she got sick. This is commonplace. I'm missing\
  \ out on time with family and friends because of her illness that she now refuses\
  \ to treat. I'm not sure what to do anymore. This has been an ongoing fight of ours\
  \ for 2 years, and I can't take it anymore. Something needs to happen.\n\nWIBTA\
  \ if i told her that she needs to do something, or else?\n\n***UPDATE/INFO:***\n\
  \nFirst of all. I have to say, some of you guys are relentless. No, I do not want\
  \ to end things with her at all. Not even a little bit. The vulgarity of some of\
  \ your private messages  is also classy.\n\n\"or else what?\"\n\nI should have worded\
  \ that better. I would like to, in essence, put my foot down on the matter. Somehow\
  \ make her go, push hard in an uncomfortable way. Show her my frustration, but also\
  \ remind her that this fight is for both of us to endure.\n\nShe has already had\
  \ a colonoscopy, endoscopy, and numerous labs on certain specific illnesses. I cannot\
  \ remember them all as they took place soon after the symptoms originated, 2 years\
  \ ago.\n\n\n\nI've decided to take some of the comments from folks who are dealing\
  \ with this simaler scenario, compile different ideas and information that can help\
  \ her and I out in our battle, and present her with it later this morning. I appreciate\
  \ all of the redditors that were willing to share their knowledge with this type\
  \ of illness. I'd also like to thank you for putting me in my place and giving me\
  \ the self check I needed to go at this with the right intentions. I'll update again\
  \ after our conversation.\n\nUpdate:\n\nLate as hell. But whatever, life is busy\
  \ for me, and I'm not online often anymore.\n\nAnyhow, the conversation was super\
  \ positive. We talked about it for a long time and I was able to really listen to\
  \ what she goes through every day. We cried. We laughed.\n\nIn the end, she agreed\
  \ to try again at working to a diagnosis, with my help financially. We'd like to\
  \ keep the percentages private.\n\nShe read through most of the comments, even the\
  \ hateful PMs from you trolls. And she is thankful for all the help and support\
  \ from the people who are suffering as well and want to help her.\n\nThat's about\
  \ all, thanks again reddit for all the positivity, this whole situation is looking\
  \ up, and it started all here \U0001F33B"
