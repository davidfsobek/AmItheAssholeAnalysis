selftext: "My girlfriend (Eva) and I have been together for 3 years and live together.\
  \ Her daughter (Laura) is 9 and we have a great relationship, but her actual dad\
  \ (Mikey) is very much still around and has her every other weekend and every other\
  \ chance he can get.\n\nSo, this week is half term holiday in England. My girlfriend,\
  \ her daughter and I went down for a mini break on a camp site in France. It was\
  \ a long drive, longer than Laura is used to, and she seemed quite sleepy. On the\
  \ motorway Laura asked \u201Cdaddy, how much  further is it\u201D. I fumbled and\
  \ answer \u201C2 hours or so, do you need to go to the toilet?\u201D.\n\nWhen we\
  \ stopped for petrol, I said to Eva that it was a bit uncomfortable with Laura calling\
  \ me dad. Eva took it badly, but I insisted. Mikey is a good dad, always 10 minutes\
  \ early to pick Laura up, drops her off with all her homework done, insists on paying\
  \ for everything and always asks for more time with her. Laura is an amazing kid\
  \ and it melts my heart to hear her call me dad, but at the same time I feel that\
  \ Mikey is her actual dad and he is the one that deserves to hear her call him \u201C\
  dad\u201D.\n\nAITA for saying that Laura should call me by my first name, and Mikey\
  \ as \"dad\"?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: the judgement sought is between myself and Eva.\
  \ Laura (the 9 year old whose name I've changed) is obviously not TA."
