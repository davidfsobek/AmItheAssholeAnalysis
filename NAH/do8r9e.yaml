selftext: "My boyfriend and I have been happily together for over 6 years. When it\
  \ comes to sleep, I am an incredibly light sleeper and find it difficult to sleep,\
  \ however my boyfriend is the complete opposite.\n\nHe likes to watch videos to\
  \ fall asleep. For some bizarre reason, the sound of middle aged men shouting about\
  \ The Witcher really soothes him. The noise and the light keeps me awake, so he\
  \ bought headphones and I wear an eye mask. The problem is that my brain can't switch\
  \ off knowing his phone is on and that he is more than likely going to pass out\
  \ and have videos playing all night. This happened the other night and he didn't\
  \ have his phone on charge. His phone died and he was late for work as his alarm\
  \ didn't go off. Suffice to say, my anxiety brain does not like that. \n\nHe wakes\
  \ up for work super early (first alarm at 5:30am, second at 5:40am, leaves at 6am).\
  \ At the latest, I can wake up 50mins after his first alarm goes off. About a year\
  \ back, I was getting up earlier (6am) just as he was leaving so I could get to\
  \ work early. I realised that I could have an uninterrupted 20 min snooze once he\
  \ left so I started doing that. He got his night time YouTube, I got my morning\
  \ 20 min snooze.\n\nRecently, he has realised that he also doesn't have to leave\
  \ until 6:20am - the end of my snooze. So he still wakes up at the same time, has\
  \ a 10 minute snooze, plays on his phone in bed for 15 mins, then gets ready for\
  \ work. He is now leaving when my snooze is supposed to end. As I am a light sleeper,\
  \ Ive now ended up waking up at his first alarm and have not been able to get back\
  \ to sleep. As someone who needs a full 8 hours a night, this is not working.\n\n\
  I asked him this morning whether he could get ready for work earlier, or not play\
  \ on his phone so I could get my snooze in, but he just replied in an aggravated\
  \ tone \"fine I'll just wake up earlier than I already do then\". I said he can\
  \ interrupt my sleep at night or in the morning, but not both. \n\nAITA for wanting\
  \ some god damn sleep at some point in the night?\n\nEdit: we talked, he downloaded\
  \ SleepTimer, I listened to white noise before bed, I will be purchasing Calm, he\
  \ didn't go on his phone for too long this morning, and I got my full 20 minute\
  \ snooze. Thank you for all the great tips, we greatly appreciated them."
