selftext: "Essentially, I have an assignment where I'm suppose to work with a partner.\
  \ I usually like doing group projects by myself, but the professor was adamant that\
  \ we do it in partners. Okay fine. \n\nWe got randomly assignment partners, and\
  \ I got assigned with a classmate who has a really thick accent. Like I can pick\
  \ up 2-3 words for every sentence she says. I tried to work with it for a couple\
  \ days, but ultimately I can not understand her. I tried asking her via email if\
  \ we could communicate through there because I couldn't understand her, but she\
  \ got offended and said that I was being prejudiced against her. \n\nI spoke to\
  \ the professor and he confessed that he also has difficulty understanding her at\
  \ times, so I'm not taking crazy pills. I switched partners with someone who speaks\
  \ her mother tongue and the project was completed. \n\nI later told my boyfriend\
  \ and my mother what happened, and my boyfriend agreed with me saying it wasn't\
  \ wrong to ask if I genuinely couldn't understand her. \n\nMy mother thinks I'm\
  \ an asshole because she's an immigrant herself, and she has told me that whenever\
  \ people don't understand her, she feels humiliated and I shouldn't have acted that\
  \ way towards her. I kinda feel like an asshole now because I wouldn't want someone\
  \ to make my mother feel like shit in the same manner that I probably did to that\
  \ girl."
