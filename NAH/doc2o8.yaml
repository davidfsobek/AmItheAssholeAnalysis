selftext: "\nMy sisters family came by my place on the way to a pumpkin patch with\
  \ a corn maze. They live a few hours away, so they stopped at my house for a pee\
  \ break. \n\nIt had unexpectedly gotten a bit chilly outside, so my niece, Elsie\
  \ asked if she could borrow a jacket.\n\nSo I got her one of mine. She ended up\
  \ saying never mind and that she didn\u2019t think she needed it anymore. I didn\u2019\
  t really think much of it after that. \n\nMy sister called me the next week to tell\
  \ me that I really upset Elsie. Elsie had just come out as transgender a few months\
  \ ago and is still dealing with some of the fallout from friends and other family\
  \ members. \n\nBy offering her a masculine looking jacket I had really upset her\
  \ and caused her to be hyper focused on her appearance and question herself.\n\n\
  She said Elsie had seen other more feminine looking jackets in my house and Elsie\
  \ was sure I was going to offer her one of them. My sister says I should have because\
  \ I should have known how much it would mess with Elsie.\n\nThe thing is those jackets\
  \ are my girlfriends jackets. I didn\u2019t think it was my place to offer them\
  \ up to someone else.\n\nEdit. In case it\u2019s not clear I did know my niece was\
  \ transgender before they came over. I\u2019ve known for months like everyone else\
  \ when she came out."
