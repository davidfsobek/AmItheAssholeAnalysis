  \ be her second Halloween since her mother and I broke up. Last Halloween, all I\
  \ got was a simple picture of her costume and a short text saying she had fun. Now,\
  \ baby momma is trying to ask if she can come pick her up for an hour or two and\
  \ take her trick or treating.\n\n\nI\u2019m really not about it. I have a full day\
  \ of activities planned and I feel like baby momma\u2019s being intrusive, especially\
  \ this close to the holiday.\n\n\nAITA for not being willing to share time?"
