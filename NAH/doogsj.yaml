selftext: "My boyfriend pirates every movie and tv series he watches and every videogame\
  \ he plays. I don't mind this, it's his own desicion, but it's something I'm not\
  \ comftorable with. He has often suggested downloading movies and series that I\
  \ want to watch for me but I have always redused telling him it's illegal and that\
  \ I don't want to be a part of it. He has always laughed at this and called me a\
  \ goody two shoes. This I don't mind and it's just playful teasing.\n\nLast night\
  \ we had plans to watch a few movies together at his place. I came over and he had\
  \ suprised me by buying my favorite snacks and by making the place nice and ready\
  \ for our movie night which was very sweet of him. \n\nI was under the impression\
  \ that he had bought the movies we were going to watch since he knows how I feel\
  \ about pirating stuff. Every movie/series we have watched together we have bought\
  \ or watched on netflix. Once I found out that he had pirated the movies I told\
  \ him straight away I wouldn't be watching them. He got mad and we had an argument\
  \ and I ended up leaving since he told me he would watch the movies with or without\
  \ me and that I was being ridiculous. Now he expects me to apologize to him for\
  \ leaving last night. Was I an asshole for leaving?"
