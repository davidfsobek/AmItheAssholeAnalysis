selftext: 'Now before I get into this I just want to say I''m not against gender neutral
  pronouns, this isn''t a political post decrying some "SJW" Whatever that means this
  week, this is about me, a colleague and my forgetfulness.


  I have a colleague I''ve been working with for about 3 years and for 2.5 of them
  I''ve known that person as a male, they introduced themselves to me as a man with
  a fairly masculine name.


  However 6 months ago they came out as gender neutral and explained that they''d
  rather be called a different, more gender neutral name and not be called any masculine
  pronouns, I was fine with the idea of this, they were able to do this without much
  fuss, this is LA 2019 afterall but my mind had other plans.


  I have ADHD Type PI, it used to be known as ADD and one of the effects I experience
  is that once I do something a certain way, I have trouble doing it any other way
  and that sadly has extended to calling my colleague their new name and preferred
  pronouns.


  The first few months I wasn''t the only one that forgot but as the weeks went by
  more and more people got used to it and now it seems I can''t go by a week without
  accidentally calling them by their original name or old pronouns.


  I''ve tried explaining but they don''t believe me and they think that it''s just
  an excuse for bigotry.


  I believe that you can be born in the wrong body and realize you''re a different
  gender but after so long of calling them one thing I can''t get used to calling
  them another, sort of like writing the wrong year in January.


  They haven''t taken kindly to me trying to explain it and they''re threatening to
  go to HR if I don''t stop but I can''t.


  EDIT: I talk to them every day and use the right pronouns most of the time but one
  a week or so I''ll slip up and call them what they were introduced as.'
