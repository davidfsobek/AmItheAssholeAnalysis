selftext: "I am an engineer and my boyfriend is a lawyer so we're doing well for ourselves\
  \ financially. But I'm not into buying new, for environmental reasons and practicality\
  \ reasons. I also think there are a lot of unethical business practices in fast\
  \ fashion and I'd like to reduce my consumption because of that. I'd rather thrift\
  \ for clothes and occasionally buy new from sustainable, ethical, clothes companies.\n\
  \nIt's not something I think of as gross or cheap or embarrassing, it feels normal\
  \ to me, and it's the cool thing to do in my social circle too. A lot of my friends\
  \ love thrifting too, and are into the whole sustainable lifestyle thing. \n\nMy\
  \ boyfriend has to shop for most of his good work clothes new, because his career\
  \ is more image based and a lot of men's suits at thrift stores are older styles\
  \ or not well enough fitting. But he likes thrifting with me for other stuff, like\
  \ outdoor wear for hiking and camping, or casual clothes.\n\nRecently my boyfriend\
  \ had a big company dinner with his law firm, all the lawyers and their spouses\
  \ would be there. I said I'd go, and I had a nice formal dress to wear. \n\nI'd\
  \ gotten it at a Goodwill in the wealthy part of town and it was from a really upscale\
  \ brand (I checked later, it's called Black Halo and their dresses are literally\
  \ hundreds of dollars new)\n\nSo at the party, a couple of the lawyer's girlfriends\
  \ and wives complimented my dress and one woman asked where it was from. I was like\
  \ \"Goodwill in (wealthy neighborhood)! I've found the most amazing things there!\"\
  \ \n\nMy boyfriend changed the topic right away to something else but at the time\
  \ I didn't notice it was a deliberate distraction.\n\nLater, my boyfriend took me\
  \ aside and asked what I was thinking, saying I got my dress at Goodwill? I said\
  \ \"what, she asked and that's where I got it.\" He said it was embarrassing; like\
  \ it or not law was very image focused and I was hurting his image in front of all\
  \ his co-workers and boss. \n\nHe asked me to look around; his co-workers wives\
  \ and girlfriends are wearing luxury brands and none of them were thrifting, or\
  \ if they were they'd never admit to it. He was right, that is kind of the culture\
  \ in that group. \n\nAITA for saying what I did or is my boyfriend wrong to care?"
