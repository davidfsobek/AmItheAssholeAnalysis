selftext: "I have two daughters, aged 12 and 10, and I homeschool both of them. This\
  \ school year, I decided to implement a \"dress code\" for school time. Towards\
  \ the end of last school year, things got kind of tough. They'd frequently want\
  \ to do school in their pajamas, and I didn't see a problem with it until they stopped\
  \ doing their school work, got distracted, went back to sleep in the middle of schoolwork.\
  \ We ended up getting behind by the end of the school year and had to supplement\
  \ by doing school over the weekends and into the summer, which the girls weren't\
  \ pleased about. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis year, I decided to implement a \"dress code\"\
  \ for homeschool. They are no longer allowed to do school in their pajamas. To really\
  \ drive home the point, I bought some school skirts and tops for them to wear while\
  \ doing school. I don't make them wear these every day, just on days when we have\
  \ a lot of work to be done. I have found them to be a lot more focused and productive.\
  \ My 10 year old loves her school outfit, my 12 year old not so much, but as we're\
  \ at home most of the day, she doesn't mind too much.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've discussed\
  \ this with some other homeschool moms, and I got a mix response, some think it's\
  \ a good idea and others think that I should have asked the girls before implementing\
  \ it and that I'm too strict. AITA?"
