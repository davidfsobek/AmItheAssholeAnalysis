selftext: 'To set the scene, my husband is lovely, wonderful and treats me like a
  princess - BUT he is the world''s worst gift giver.


  Its something I have been putting up with for the last 8 years, he gets the most
  awful gifts, and even though the thought is there, he never seems to get the hang
  of it.


  For example last year for my birthday he asked me what I wanted, I replied with
  a picture of a pink ipad case with white spots on...what do I get? A plush hippo
  ipad case... he tends to see the item itself, not the specifics (so I ask for a
  pink lipstick and he gets me a blue one for example) even when I specify I like
  this one because it''s pink etc.


  I have tried to politely raise this with him over the years, as it was getting to
  the point where I would dread opening my gifts because I was worried about what
  would be inside, I haven''t had one gift from him I have ever kept, they have always
  had to be exchanged or taken back.


  He obviously gets a bit upset about this.


  My issue is, today is my birthday, and he has gone out and gotten me a coat... It''s
  a good quality coat, it''s an expensive coat, but its god damn awful (think leather
  leopard print biker jacket - I have never worn leopard print in my life and hope
  to keep this going)


  I will never wear it, and since it''s expensive I want to ask him to return it,
  or exchange for one I will wear (otherwise it will be a waste) however I am wondering
  if I would be the asshole to ask him to do this yet again and make him feel bad
  :( if the coat was in some way redeemable, then I would wear it a couple of times
  then banish it to the back of the wardrobe, but its so, so, so bad.'
