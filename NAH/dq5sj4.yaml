selftext: "I was raised very, very, Protestant. One condition that's very endemic\
  \ to this community is vaginismus, which is a condition that basically makes vaginal\
  \ sex difficult to impossible. It's medically proven that this is heavily caused\
  \ by religion. For various reasons, I thought I'd avoided this as I was able to\
  \ use tampons and insert a finger when needed. Unfortunately, I have not. \n\nThe\
  \ treatments for this take a lot of time and money that I don't really have. I haven't\
  \ been able to make much of any progress because I would have to do it daily and\
  \ I've already spent almost $300 on this. I also need to have regular physical therapy\
  \ that I don't have the time or money to do. It's brutal and I have so much hatred\
  \ for the people that did this to me. I cry basically every day. While I currently\
  \ have a boyfriend who is at least pretending to be understanding, as the months\
  \ wear on he's definitely going to leave me because it's not realistic to be with\
  \ someone you can't really have sex with. \n\nI can never get married, because it's\
  \ not like I can play ignorant about this. I feel like I have to be open and willing\
  \ to do fetish things that make me feel weird as a \"consolation prize\". My INTRODUCTION\
  \ to sex is things that most people don't do until years into a sex life. \n\nI\
  \ had an argument with my mother over, basically, insurance and I ended up pretty\
  \ angrily telling her that she well should be letting me use her insurance on this\
  \ because it's all her fault and her stupid f*cking religion ruined my life. She\
  \ started crying and hung up. AITA?"
