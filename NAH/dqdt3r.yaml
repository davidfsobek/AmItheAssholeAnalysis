selftext: "Hi Reddit! Throwaway acc here because this story is not at all flattering.\
  \ \n\nSo my wife and I play very extreme pranks on each other. Like next level awful.\
  \ My dad was in hospital for cancer treatments and she was in the hospital area.\
  \ She prank called me and told me he had died. I got to the hospital and there they\
  \ both were, laughing. It didn\u2019t upset me or piss me off or anything, and is\
  \ actually my favourite remaining memory of him. Just putting that story here to\
  \ provide some context to our relationship and how extreme our jokes can be. \n\n\
  Well on April fools day this year, I was at home and my wife was out with her sister\
  \ for the day. No big deal. \n\nShe had been out for about an hour when I got a\
  \ message from her saying her water had broken. \n\nThat\u2019s funny, I thought,\
  \ shes not due for another 5 weeks but oh well. She\u2019s just joking. I put my\
  \ phone down and continued to do my work. I saw one other message from her but thought\
  \ she was joking still. I mean, it\u2019s April fools!\n \nTwo hours passed and\
  \ it wasn\u2019t until I saw my sister in law calling and decided to answer. She\
  \ then proceeded to scream at me, as my wife was now in the hospital and about to\
  \ have our first child. Well, regardless of if she was joking or not, I jumped in\
  \ my car and drove down \n\nWell, she wasn\u2019t joking. After a few long hours,\
  \ and a billion apologies to my wife, she said it was fine. She actually seemed\
  \ to find it quite funny and said I inspired her for the next baby, but I should\u2019\
  ve known she wouldn\u2019t pick a day as obvious as April fools. \n\nMy wife seemed\
  \ fine with it, but my SIL was livid at me. \n\nI\u2019m pretty sure I know the\
  \ answer here, but Reddit, AITA?\n\nEDIT: I saw a few comments mentioning this,\
  \ and we were already planning to end the pranks once the kiddo was here!\n\nEDIT2:\
  \ Yes, me and the Mrs are now discussing code words for when/if we decide to carry\
  \ on the pranks. Thank you for your suggestions!"
