selftext: "So this just happened and I\u2019m kind of shocked at the crazy left turn\
  \ in this conversation. For reference, I\u2019m a guy that matched with a young\
  \ woman on tinder. I\u2019m attempting to recreate the conversation, I can\u2019\
  t repeat it verbatim as she just unmatched me, but I\u2019ll do my best to be accurate.\n\
  \nHer: Hey how\u2019s it going. \n\nMe: Not much. Just trying to figure out what\
  \ to eat. How about you?\n\nHer: Same actually!\n\nMe: Cool. What\u2019re you thinking?\n\
  \nHer: I can\u2019t decide. I\u2019m a little high right now...\n\nMe: Oh, so you\
  \ just want to eat everything. Well, what would you choose between tacos, sushi,\
  \ and burgers?\n\nHer: Sushi sounds so good!\n\nMe: Do you know any good sushi spots\
  \ around [neighborhood]?\n\nHer: Yeah [place] is really good. \n\nMe: Ooh, all day\
  \ happy hour. Want to join me for some sushi and cocktails?\n\nHer: We really should\
  \ talk on the phone before that happens. \n\nMe: Like, an actual phone call?\n\n\
  Her: uh... yeah?\n\nMe: Interesting. I\u2019ve never heard that stipulation before\
  \ lol. What\u2019s your number?\n\nHer: actually, never mind. What an absolutely\
  \ immature and retarded response to a perfectly reasonable thing. \n\nThen she unmatched\
  \ me. So, I find myself a little blindsided, but also second guessing myself. So\
  \ I\u2019m turning to you and your judgement: was I immature in my response or did\
  \ I just dodge a bullet?"
