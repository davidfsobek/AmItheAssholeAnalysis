selftext: 'I (F30) have just been invited to my nephew''s thirteen birthday. Its not
  a big deal, just his dad''s side of the family coming over for a bit of cake. Kid
  only wants cash, has for some years now, so we''re used to it, although it''s not
  the most fun thing to give a kid.


  But the thing is... He is becoming a bit of a jerk. He''s not a BAD kid, just entitled
  and inconsiderate. Last two birthdays we''ve come over he just grabs his cash, eats
  his cake, and then goes to his room to play video games (while everyone else, including
  his sister, play boardgames together). And I''m like, fine whatever, he''s a kid,
  but I feel like he''s getting old enough that he should try to be more aware of
  other people and how he comes off as a person. His parents let''s him do whatever,
  BUT I know from my brother/his dad that it bothers him too.


  ANYWAY: last week I texted the kid about something unrelated, and he never answered
  me (if you want to know what, I added it in EDIT below). Or the text I sent the
  next day, or the day after that. Which kind of pisses me off. He''s a young man
  now, can''t answer a damn text? And now, we''ve been invited over by his parents
  for the birthday thing, told he only wants money on his mobile pay (cash transfer
  on his cell phone number), and I''m thinking about showing up, and then if anyone
  ask if I gave him anything, just say something of the sort of "oh, I don''t think
  I have the right number on you, kiddo.  Wouldn''t want to send money to someone
  else on accident," and if he says it IS his number, then have a conversation about,
  "well, if it is your number, then why don''t you write back?" (maybe not that last
  part, but you get my drift). I don''t want to do it big or humiliate him, but I
  kind of think we as grownups and family members need to help kids understand when
  they act in inconsiderable ways. I almost did something similar last Christmas,
  because he couldn''t even be bothered telling anyone what he wished for, thinking
  he''d just get money then, so I pretended to have bought a piece of rainforest in
  his name and told him jokingly that''s what happens when you don''t make wishes.
  He was shocked, and I could tell his dad secretly approved, but of course my mom
  told me that really buying a piece of rainforest as a gift would be rude, so kid
  got his money anyway. But this year, I''m like, no, if the kid can''t even answer
  a goddamn text, then I can''t transfer money to his entitled little self. I don''t
  know, am I just being a grumpy grownup? Again, I don''t expect a backlash from his
  parents, I could always give them some money for the cake I eat, but I feel like
  we''re all just pampering the kid and he could do with a little reality check.


  EDIT. I feel like many people think I''ll be super mean about it (and I DO see I
  sound annoyed here) but the plan was to do it jokingly and with a smile. Is that
  totally impossible?


  EDIT. The text. I''m playing pokemon go, he was too at some point so I just texted
  him and asked if he still played it and had seen  that there were halloween pokemon
  out. Then, after a few days without answer, I wished him happy birthday and asked
  if he had any wishes. After that I just texted his name, asking if this was still
  his number if he could just let me know. I guess I could''ve called, but I felt
  like that would be even more confronting.


  EDIT. As for how well I know nephew, I live very close and sometimes come over and
  play games with my brother and 15 year-old niece (mom and nephew not interested).
  We try to engage nephew, but as soon as he''s not winning he gives up (and the last
  few times have refused to play altogether). Which is another thing I feel like his
  dad wants to change, but we never pressure the kid, just tells him we miss him and
  wanna have fun with him, but we leave him to do his own thing always. Other times
  I take both kids to the movies. He''s not an unhappy kid, or partuculatly introvert,   but
  just cosy and accustomed to getting things his way.'
