  My wife is three months pregnant and has had some minor complications with the pregnancy
  which has lead her gyno to advise her not to run at all throughout the pregnancy,
  or to do any other sports which may result in jolting of her body or similar.


  Running is something that we''ve always done together, and is additionally the main
  thing I do to keep my mental health in check (I suffer from bouts of anxiety and
  depression). My wife is really unhappy that she is unable to run for likely the
  next seven to eight months.


  We were recently away for the weekend with her parents, and somehow got on to the
  topic of exercise. Her mother made the comment of ''if you are going to continue
  to to exercise, can''t you do it while she isn''t around?'', implying that I should
  run during my lunch hour at work (I work full time from home), and that by exercising
  or by talking about exercise I am making my wife ''feel bad''. Her suggestion would
  mean that I would no longer be able to go for longer runs on weekends, which I really
  enjoy.


  I was quite angered by this and my wife and I later argued because of it. I feel
  that I shouldn''t have to compromise my health (both mental and physical) because
  my wife is unable to participate in something we used to do together, due to no
  fault of my own.


  So let me have it, Reddit: AITA?


  --------------------------------


  **Edit:**

  When I said ''due to no fault of my own'', I was referring to the complications
  she had early on in her pregnancy which have resulted in the recommendation that
  she does not run for the remainder of the pregnancy. There is no blame to be had
  here in regards to her being pregnant - we''re both very happy about it :)


  Thanks to /u/Lizzurd31 for highlighting the lack of clarity here.


  --------------------------------


  **Edit 2:**

  I want to highlight that things are all good between my wife and I. We''re not mad
  at each other, and we will figure out how we can exercise together. The AITA question
  stems from her mothers apparent belief that I should change / hide / stop running
  due to the fact that my wife is unable to for the duration of her pregnancy.


  I was a bit pissed off still when I originally wrote this and likely chose a bad
  title, used some bad wording, and didn''t write as clearly as a I could have. Please
  INFO if you have questions - as much as I am not supposed to defend myself according
  to the AITA rules, clearly one post cannot share all context of the situation and
  I would prefer the opportunity to fill in the blanks before judgement.


  --------------------------------


  **Edit 3:**

  Thanks for all the suggestions everybody. My wife and I have further discussed this
  and have come up with a resolution which works for us both, and will start some
  exercise activities together later this week which we can do together (Yoga, and
  swimming). I will find both more challenging than she will probably, as running
  and cycling are pretty much the only sports I''ve done for a few years!


  Thanks for all your input :)'
