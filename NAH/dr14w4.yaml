  \ at a shop, the tattoo is still good and I still like it, but now their work is\
  \ at this amazing, mind blowing level, and I kind of have a different idea of where\
  \ I would like to go with this arm piece. I want them to do it, since I love their\
  \ art style and they have done all of my tattoos, but would it be offensive to ask\
  \ them to cover up their own work?  \n\nI got my original tattoo like four years\
  \ ago."
