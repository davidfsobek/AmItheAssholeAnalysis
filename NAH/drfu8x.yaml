selftext: "My son is in 4th grade and has been invited to a classmate's birthday party\
  \ for next weekend.  When he brought home the invitation,  he asked me to RSVP \"\
  no\".  I asked him if he was sure/disliked the boy (as I have never heard mention\
  \ of him). He said that he doesn't really know him, but that the kid is \"very bossy\"\
  \ in classes. \n\nFine by me. I was always taught that not everyone is going to\
  \ like you, and you aren't going to like everyone. So long as one is polite/civil\
  \ that is okay. \n\nI am friends with a mother of a student at my son's school (our\
  \ kids are 3 yrs apart, and we did not meet through them). She asked me if I was\
  \ making my son go to the first boy's party,  as she had heard that no one has RSVP'ed\
  \ \"yes\" yet. Turns out that her older child is friends with the bday boy's older\
  \ siblings. I told her, no, as my son did not want to. She says, that she knows\
  \ the boy and he is \"brat\", but he still shouldn't be alone on his birthday. \
  \ \n\nI don't now my child's classmate, but as long as there is no bullying (by\
  \ or towards my son), I think he is old enough to choose his friends. Am I the asshole\
  \ for not forcing him to go?"
