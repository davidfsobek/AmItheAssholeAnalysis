selftext: "On Thursday evening my wife started feeling unwell. I encouraged her to\
  \ go to bed and told her I could handle the kids evening stuff by myself (3 kids,\
  \ ages 9, 11, and 13). I checked on her after the kids were in bed at 9 and she\
  \ was fevered- I asked if she wanted any medicine, made sure she had some water,\
  \ and rubbed her back for a few minutes. I slept in the spare room but got up twice\
  \ to check on her. The next morning I got the kids ready and off to school, went\
  \ to a meeting and came home at 10 to take her to the doctor. I worked from home\
  \ until our cleaning lady came around 1 and asked her to keep an eye on my wife\
  \ and went back into the office for a couple meetings, picked up the kids and was\
  \ home around 4. Her fever broke shortly after I got home at 4 and I helped her\
  \ shower. Our oldest had a school dance and I got some movies and set the youngest\
  \ 2 up in the den for the evening with pizza and some games so they'd be quiet.\
  \ I checked on my wife periodically and after the oldest got home me and the 3 kids\
  \ camped out in the den. \n\nOn Saturday morning, the kids were restless so I took\
  \ them out for the day bc I didn't want them to be around the house being loud.\
  \ I checked on my wife and she was sleeping- I refilled her water and left her a\
  \ note. Throughout the day I called and sent her messages and my mom took her over\
  \ some homemade soup and checked on her. We were gone the majority of the day but\
  \ the kids came home worn out and we crashed in the den again. I checked on my wife\
  \ as soon as we got home and she was looking better. Sunday morning, the kids and\
  \ I woke up early, did some yardwork then went to the store to do the weekly grocery\
  \ shopping. When we got home my wife was up and about and still weak but feeling\
  \ better. However, she was being really short with me and was in a bad mood. I thought\
  \ it was just bc she didn't feel well but after a few hours of her making snide\
  \ comments I asked her if something was wrong and she exploded on me that her family\
  \ abandoned her while she was sick. She went off about how she always takes care\
  \ of us when we're sick but we avoided her like the plague and didn't stay home\
  \ and I made the cleaning lady and my mom take care of her instead of doing it myself.\
  \ I tried to explain that I didn't want to expose the kids to being sick and I didn't\
  \ want them around the house being loud while she was trying to rest and I checked\
  \ on her multiple times. She said I should've sent the kids to my parents or something\
  \ and stayed home and she can't believe I didn't sleep with her for 3 days. I starting\
  \ getting angry and told her that I did what I thought was best and she sounded\
  \ ungrateful bc it wasn't exactly what she would've done. She then called me an\
  \ asshole. We went to bed angry and didn't really speak this morning. I keep stewing\
  \ over this bc I don't think that I'm an asshole but maybe I am?"
