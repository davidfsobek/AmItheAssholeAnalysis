selftext: "My fiance (27M) and I (25F) have been discussing purchasing a house. We\
  \ decided it would be better for him to see if he would be approved for the mortgage\
  \ on his own as I have some debts (student loans) and he has a considerably higher\
  \ salary than I do (\\~$20,000 more annually). We were discussing the details yesterday\
  \ and joking around when he said he's going to have me sign a prenup when we get\
  \ married. At first I thought he was joking but unfortunately he is 100% set on\
  \ this.  I laughed it off and dropped the subject so I didn't make the situation\
  \ worse but after spending the night thinking about it I'm pretty angry.\n\nHere\
  \ is why I am against it:- We were initially going to make this purchase together\
  \ however decided it would be best to go on his credit/salary alone.- I'm going\
  \ to be paying half the closing fees/mortgage/bills etc.- We've planned for me to\
  \ stay home after having kids until they're school aged and I hate that I'm even\
  \ thinking about this but should we divorce that would leave me without any financial\
  \ assets or a job - meaning nothing to show the courts I can provide for children\
  \ on my own which could result in me losing custody.\n\nSo WIBTA if I refused signing\
  \ a prenup and instead suggested we go for a mortgage together or not at all?\n\n\
  &#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*EDIT - INFO\\*\\*\n\n1. He brought up a prenup to state the house\
  \ would be his in event of divorce.\n2. My credit is decent however with student\
  \ loan debt + financing a new vehicle we figured we'd be approved going in with\
  \ his records alone.\n3. We live in Canada.\n4. We are both pitching in for the\
  \ down payment.\n5. Neither of us have significant assets or family wealth. We do\
  \ well in our respective careers and have a decent savings (joint & separate). \n\
  \n\\*\\* EDIT \\*\\*\n\nFirst off, thank you for all your advice, input & even the\
  \ insults.I understand I should have put more than 30 seconds of research into prenups\
  \ before posting. I was initially upset over the idea of a prenup in the first place\
  \ as I view marriage as a lifetime commitment - not something we should plan the\
  \ end of. I will be taking all your advice and suggestions into my conversation\
  \ with my fiance and when the time comes I will seek out my own lawyer to ensure\
  \ I have a safety net as well."
