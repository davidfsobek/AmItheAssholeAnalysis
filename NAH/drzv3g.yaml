selftext: "My grandparents invited me, my wife, mom, dad, brother, and our 1 year\
  \ old  baby to Disney world and they are covering the room expenses.\n\n&#x200B;\n\
  \nIt's a resort room in animal kingdom totaling over 10k for 4 day stay. All we\
  \ have to do is cover tickets, airfare, and food.\n\nNow this seems pretty damn\
  \ awesome but we foud out last night they got a 2 bedroom resort meaning that me,\
  \ my wife, my dad, and mom all have to share a room WITH a baby while my brother\
  \ sleeps on sofa bed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI said this was a waste of money (on grandparents\
  \ part) to get a super expensive room and only have 2 bedrooms knowing we have a\
  \ baby as well ( he will be 1yr and 2 days old when we go) and this morning i turned\
  \ down the offer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy parents are making it seem like you are barely\
  \ in the room anyway and it's not that big of a deal but with a baby I'm sure this\
  \ is going to be an absolute headache and I just feel bad. Especially because grandparents\
  \ were making it seem like it was a \"family\" thing they wanted to do... AITA?\n\
  \n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n \n\nbedroom one: OP's grandparents\n\nLiving Room: OP's\
  \ brother\n\nbedroom two: OP's parents, OP, OP's wife, and the baby\n\n\n**UPDATE**\n\
  \nSo after talking with everyone all day my parents decided our point was valid\
  \ and they decided to get a separate room near ours for themselves to free up a\
  \ room for us to use with my brother. I\u2019m not happy that they are now spending\
  \ more money because of us, but they really wanted us to be there and decided it\
  \ was worth it for them. \nThanks for all the feedback, it helped us get our thoughts\
  \ together better."
