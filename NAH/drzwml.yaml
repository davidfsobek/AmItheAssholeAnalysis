selftext: "This happened a couple months ago. \n \nI was interviewing a person for\
  \ a job, and it turns out, that person was my ex. I, as the interviewer, can reject\
  \ a person based on our current or past relationship with them. There is literally\
  \ a box for it in our sheet. \n \nSo, a huge stroke of bad luck graced upon her.\
  \ We had another equally qualified candidate that hasn't had a relationship with\
  \ me, so he did get the upper hand. \n \nWe did date for 2 years, and it ended with\
  \ her breaking up with me. I'm over it, since I am getting married in a couple months.\
  \ A couple people called me an asshole for rejecting her just because she broke\
  \ up with me, but I rejected her because romantic relationships, especially prior\
  \ ones, are very frowned upon where we work. \n \nAITA?\n \nEdit: We work for a\
  \ tutoring company. They both the same degree from similarly leveled colleges. Honestly,\
  \ they were extremely close in skill. Same age, very similar work experience. Honestly,\
  \ I flip a coin for decisions like this."
