selftext: "As I'm typing this out I'm starting to feel like I am TA but here goes:\n\
  \nI work at a popular Canadian coffee chain, in a large Muslim community. So, as\
  \ you can guess, a lot of Muslim people come into our store. Now, most items on\
  \ the menu are halal, but little things like certain baked goods and marshmallows\
  \ are not.\nWhenever someone asks, I will tell them exactly what is/isn't halal\
  \ and they order accordingly. \n\nHowever, the issues arises when someone wearing\
  \ a headscarf/burqa comes in and orders something non-halal. I cannot say for sure\
  \ they are muslim, and my muslim manager says to not say anything unless they ask,\
  \ but that feels wrong? But on the few occasions I have said something I think I\
  \ have offended people who felt like I was judging their order:( I never want to\
  \ offend anyone.\n\nTL;DR: Muslim people order non-halal food in my cafe and I don't\
  \ say anything unless asked. AITA?\n\n\nEDIT AGAIN: I work for a large chain so\
  \ I can ask my manager to make changes but ultimately food signage is up to head\
  \ office not us :)"
