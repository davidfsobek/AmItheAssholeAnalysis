selftext: 'Apologies for the format and rambling, this is my first post on reddit
  and I have a bad habit of unknowingly repeating myself but I tried to get this out
  in acceptable English... Sorry if this is bothersome, I will be happy to make edits
  if anything is unclear and would appreciate your opinions, thanks.


  My girlfriend has recently gone vegan in the past few months, before this, we both
  ate meat together and she would often reject meal offers from me and then proceed
  to eat a decent portion of my meal ^((irrelevant, simply a pet peeve as it often
  reduced the enjoyment I would get from my meals fighting for my knife and fork....
  not sure if im an asshole here, but not the big picture)). Anyway, I have always
  been a big meat eater, I am however am willing to accept that processed meats such
  as ham and salami and sausages are unhealthy and am trying to cut them from my diet,
  and would also agree to a certain degree that red meats are unhealthy, but I''ve
  never been big on red meat anyway... I have studied nutrition to a certain level
  in highschool and watch bodybuilding and related videos and meal guides almost excessively.
  One of my favourite content creators always references studies in his videos often
  from both sides of arguments. As such, based on my research and as a guy working
  in a physical job as well as interested in both building and maintaining muscle,
  I believe that meat is essential in a balanced diet in order to achieve an optimal
  level of protein.. I also love the taste of meat. I made it clear when she began
  to pursue a vegan lifestyle that although I support her doing so I myself have absolutely
  no interest in doing so in the foreseeable future, and have maintained this view
  throughout this period. I have however, been to a few vegan restuarants with her
  and shared vegan meals with her at home, and although I can enjoy the meals it''s
  not a diet that I would want to restrict myself to. **Recently my girlfriend has
  been actively trying to convince me to go vegan, and when I have adamantly refused
  she has become openly frustrated with me for a lack of reason and has given me silent
  treatment when she feels that I have not provided reason enough.**


  **Am I The Asshole here?** I feel like I made it clear from the beginning what my
  intentions were and I feel like she ignores my rebuttal based on my findings of
  a healthy diet, as information that she is exposed to provides different answers
  (I recognize that all studies are not equal and that many will provide conflicting
  answers, and often both these studies will respectively say that a diet consisting
  of meat or a vegan diet are healthier) She has also discussed the ethical reasons
  for veganism however I feel that I am not obligated to pursue a vegan diet and the
  backlash I am receiving in the situation is unfair.. Opinions?


  Edit: Yes I will watch Game Changers'
