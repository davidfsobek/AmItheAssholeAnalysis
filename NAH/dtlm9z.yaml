selftext: "Hey asshole enthusiasts, I need some help. My [26M] girlfriend [24F] and\
  \ I both have stable jobs that cover bills and allow us the occasional fun trip.\
  \ She finished college recently and makes less with her degree then she previously\
  \ did serving. I never finished college due to drug abuse (sober 4 years last month),\
  \ and I\u2019m currently applying to different school to finish my degree. Now,\
  \ we\u2019re both saving money to move out of state by the summer (end of our lease),\
  \ as we\u2019re both beyond ready to leave our hometown. We put away money regularly,\
  \ and after some calculations, I\u2019m fairly confident it will be enough to cover\
  \ moving and expenses, but she explains that \u201Cwe\u2019re broke\u201D because\
  \ we can\u2019t put away more money than we have been. \n\nHere\u2019s where there\u2019\
  s trouble. She originally suggests serving at a strip club in a city about 1.5 hours\
  \ away. She did it briefly before we met, and I told her it honestly made me extremely\
  \ uncomfortable and I wanted to pursue any other option than that. After some days\
  \ of arguing, she\u2019s adamant that there are none. I originally took the stance\
  \ of \u201Cthis is a deal breaker\u201D, but after speaking to my oldest sister\
  \ (she\u2019s been my sounding board since childhood and basically raised me due\
  \ to family issues), I realized I was wrong on this one. Serving and stripping are\
  \ 2 very different things, and even though it still made me uncomfortable, that\u2019\
  s because of my own insecurities. I told her we could try her serving at the club\
  \ and I would keep an open mind and support her. Then she tells me she needs to\
  \ strip - not serve - to make enough money to be comfortable with. This is something\
  \ that I\u2019m absolutely uncomfortable with, especially given that it\u2019s in\
  \ a different city (albeit, not terribly far away). Now I\u2019m wondering if i\
  \ need to reassess my thoughts/reactions to her stripping as I did with her serving,\
  \ however I feel like that is a whole new ball game with vastly different nuances.\
  \ So, AITA? Also, I\u2019ll gladly take any perspective from anyone with similar\
  \ situations.\n\nEDIT: First of all, thank you everyone for your opinions and insights,\
  \ over the entire spectrum of them. I did not expect to get this much response.\
  \ However, I want to make a couple things clear: \n\n\u2022 I am not shaming strippers,\
  \ slut shaming, or assigning any negative connotation to stripping or sex work.\
  \ I understand it\u2019s a regulated industry, a great way to make lots of money,\
  \ and I think there\u2019s nothing wrong with anyone wanting to pursue that, and\
  \ it makes them no less of a person and of no less quality of character than anyone\
  \ else. \n\n\u2022 I am not dictating what she can and can\u2019t do. Obviously\
  \ she\u2019s more than free to pursue stripping, and I would think no less of her\
  \ as a woman or adult. \n\n\u2022 Like many have pointed out, there are a couple\
  \ specific reasons her choosing this would make me uncomfortable. There\u2019s the\
  \ safety issue - it\u2019s almost an hour and a half away, there are certain risk\
  \ factors associated with working at establishments like that (a generalization,\
  \ but I still think it\u2019s something to consider), and then there\u2019s a potential\
  \ (statistically probable) drug use associated with strip clubs and how that might\
  \ affect her or me (again, a generalization, but one to consider). Then there\u2019\
  s the relationship issue - as you guys have said, there are plenty who can have\
  \ healthy relationships with one or both being a sex worker, but not everyone is\
  \ wired like that, and it appears that I am not. In the context of a monogamous\
  \ relationship, I don\u2019t see full nudity, dancing for the sexual pleasure of\
  \ others, and  personal lap dances as something I could healthily handle or want\
  \ from a partner. There\u2019s also something to be said of the intimacy of a physically\
  \ exclusive relationship, and how in my own mind, I can\u2019t reconcile with the\
  \ mechanics and realities of a career in stripping. \n\nI\u2019m sorry for being\
  \ so long winded, but I really appreciate the responses, perspectives, and questions\
  \ you\u2019ve brought up for me to think about. A couple responses that caught my\
  \ eye suggested something of a trial run - letting her start and then monitoring\
  \ my thoughts/feelings/reactions towards her and our relationship. If it\u2019s\
  \ something I really can\u2019t get past, then I walk away and wish her the best\
  \ - as she honestly deserves it. If it\u2019s something I turn out to be able to\
  \ handle without compromising my values, then we get to save extra money, but more\
  \ importantly, our relationship.\n\n(irrelevant) EDIT 2: thank you everyone for\
  \ the sobriety comments. Support from strangers is part of what helped me get this\
  \ far, and those who are on the same boat, I\u2019m proud of you."
