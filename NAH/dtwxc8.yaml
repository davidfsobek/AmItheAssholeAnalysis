selftext: "My son Simon is 16 and recently came out to his mother, sister, and I as\
  \ gay.  We all fully support him and my wife and I were extremely happy he trusted\
  \ us enough to come out to us.  Other than us and a few of his closest friends at\
  \ school nobody really knows about this.  Simon came to me the other night and said\
  \ he was thinking about coming out to the entire family.  I asked if he'd be willing\
  \ to wait a bit to come out to avoid potential drama with his grandmother (my mother.)\n\
  \nMy mother has always been homophobic.  She typically keeps these opinions to herself,\
  \ but my siblings and I are all well aware of her attitudes on the subject of gay\
  \ people.  She hates them.  We've tried for years to change her mind but we all\
  \ realize now it will never happen.  If she were to find out about Simon she would\
  \ freak out and cause all sorts of drama that I think most of the family would rather\
  \ avoid. \n\nMy mother is terminally ill and has been refusing treatment for the\
  \ last year.  At her most recent appointment the doctor told us that she would be\
  \ lucky to live another month after all the damage her refusal to get treated has\
  \ caused her.  So at this point we are just waiting on her to die.   This is why\
  \ I asked Simon if he'd wait.  I figure that if my mother dies and then he comes\
  \ out some time after she is gone then he can get all the love and support of our\
  \ family without any issues with my mother coming about.\n\nSimon and I spoke about\
  \ this for awhile.  I made sure he knew that if he decided to come out to her anyway\
  \ or to try and just tell the rest of the family without her knowing I would support\
  \ him 100% and would do what I could to help, but Simon seemed to agree with me\
  \ after a bit and said he would wait and come out at a later time.  I told my wife\
  \ about the talk later and she got upset saying I was forcing Simon to deny who\
  \ he is just to appease my mother.  While I understand her point of view and that\
  \ \"keeping the peace\" isn't usually the best option I felt like my mother only\
  \ being around a few more weeks kind of changed the dynamic and that this was an\
  \ appropriate solution to a potential problem.  She isn't as upset now as she was\
  \ initially, but it is clear to me she does not approve but won't interfere since\
  \ Simon has agreed not to come out yet.\n\nI'm conflicted now because I don't want\
  \ to enable homophobia, but I also just want to get through my mother's last few\
  \ weeks of life with as few complications as possible for the sake of the entire\
  \ family, many of whom are still deep in grief.  So AITA for asking him to do this?"
