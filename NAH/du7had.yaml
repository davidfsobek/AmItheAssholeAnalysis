selftext: 'I''m 51M, my sister 48F has two children, my nephew 17M and my niece 18F.
  Both are in highschool right now and both want to go to college/university.


  I promised my nephew I''d pay for his school, which in Canada is not much. About
  $4-5k/yr, so figure around $20,000. I can afford it and I want to do it because
  he''s like a son to me. We''ve bonded so much ever since he was young, he''s my
  favorite kid in the whole world, to be frank. He visits frequently, we play videogames,
  board games, etc.


  My niece and my sister are upset I''m not extending the same offer to my niece.
  We''re just not close, or at least not as close as I am with my nephew. It''s not
  about money, I *could* do it, but I''m choosing not to. I see her maybe twice a
  year when I see my nephew at least twice a month. Beyond that, we don''t even have
  each other on Facebook to give an idea of distance.


  Am I the asshole here? For what it''s worth, I have no idea what my nephew wants
  to go for, but he''s twirled the idea of linguistics around. My niece wants to go
  for mathematics, I know that much. My choice has nothing to do with what they want
  to do, I think both are noble pursuits.'
