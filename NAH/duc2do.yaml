selftext: 'So, I have been seeing my boyfriend, "Alan" for about 9 months. Things
  are going really well. I live in an apartment and he lives in a house across the
  city from me. He has a 13 year old daughter that spends 3 or 4 days a week with
  him, depending on the week. He spends the night at my apartment sometimes or vice
  versa on the days that he doesn''t have his daughter. Things have been going really
  well and he introduced me to his daughter when we attended one of her baseball games.
  So that her Mom could be there (I''ve met her twice; she is lovely) and everyone
  was comfortable. She is a lovely girl (his daughter), and we''ve done a few mall
  trips and I''ve had my nails done with her once, too. Her Mom is comfortable with
  her spending time with me, I got permission from her directly on the phone. But,
  we haven''t been doing sleepovers because it just doesn''t feel appropriate at this
  point. Lately though, Alan has been dropping hints that it would be nicer and easier
  if his daughter could just spend the night or if I would just come to his place.
  Going home to separate places after taking 1 car to a late movie on a Saturday for
  example. Here''s my hangup: it explicitly states in his custody agreement that no
  unmarried partner can spend the night under the same roof as his daughter. Now,
  her mother told me that she doesn''t mind, trusts me, and that their lawyers both
  advised including that for their daughters safety (of course) but since they know
  me and the circumstances, it''s okay. My point is that no matter what people say
  they''re okay with at the time, I don''t want anybody going back or changing their
  mind or pulling a contract out and getting Alan in trouble or causing ANY hard feelings
  or problems for anyone involved. Alan seems to feel like it''s something personal
  despite my insistence that it''s not and thinks that I''m being rude by allowing
  him but not his daughter to spend the night and that I''m essentially disrespecting
  his family. I would love an opinion on whether or not I am the Ahole.'
