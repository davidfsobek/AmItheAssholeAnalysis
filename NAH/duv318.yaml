selftext: 'I''m a photographer and I take photos of influencers. Usually this includes
  editing them heavily, like getting rid of blemishes/spots, making them slightly
  thinner ect. There are definitely moral issues that I completely understand, but
  unfortunately it''s industry standard.


  My girlfriend knows what I do, including the editing parts. She recently asked me
  for a portrait. After we finish shooting, I say "Do you want these *really* professional?"
  which she says yes. I''m certain that this implied editing the photo.


  I spend a few hours doing touch-ups. Removing blemishes, neatening hair, all the
  standard stuff. I''d like to make it clear: I didn''t do anything crazy, just subtle
  things. She see it and she likes it, but wonders what it looks like before I did
  the editing. I show her, and that''s when she gets pissed with me. I don''t think
  she was expecting how much of a difference small changes can make.


  I did try tell her that she is very attractive, and this the "magazine" version
  of herself. I phrase it by saying it''s not that she''s ugly and I''ve made her
  pretty - it''s that she''s already beautiful, and I''m emphasising what I find beautiful
  about her, to an unrealistic level (in the way professionals do). She''s still somewhat
  upset.


  So AITA here? I feel that she knew what I was doing, and agreed for me to do the
  touch ups. I can understand why she''d be upset, but it''s annoying to do hours
  of work for someone to be treated like I had malicious intent all along...


  EDIT: Just addressing the critiques on the vagueness of "professional". I get it
  would seem vague without context, so please let me add some more. I met her through
  work. She''s not ignorant to the inner workings of photography. She knew what I
  meant by professional, and was interested to see exactly what edits I had made,
  before asking to see the before. The problem seems to be that I didn''t ask what
  changes she''d like to be done, and not emphasising that I like her just the way
  she is - silly me!'
