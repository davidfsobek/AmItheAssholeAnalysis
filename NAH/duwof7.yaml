selftext: "\nI am a renter in a small city, I'm renting a place in an old factory\
  \ that was converted to modern apartments. It's a 4 story building with about 7\
  \ units per floor. Not all the units are full so I have a feeling the landlord is\
  \ looking hard to fill the place.\n\nWhen I got my lease, I noticed they had some\
  \ unusually strict rules. I didn't want to live somewhere really restrictive, so\
  \ I thought I'd negotiate the terms and look elsewhere if I couldn't work something\
  \ out\n\nI read the whole thing and I crossed out parts I didn't agree with, and\
  \ made notes of things that my landlord neglected to say. Then I brought it back\
  \ and said I'd like some terms changed, and asked if they'd agree to them. To my\
  \ surprise, they agreed to all of them without any more negotiation, and wrote up\
  \ a modified lease. I had honestly expected them to say no, or only agree to a few\
  \ things.\n\nHere's what I wanted changed:\n\nThey had a \"max guests at a time\
  \ is 6\" rule which I asked them to get rid of because I host a chill DnD group\
  \ twice a month with a bigger group.\n\nThey had a \"one guest in the pool area\
  \ max\" and I asked for a maximum of 3 because I wanted to have my three closest\
  \ friends over at once.\n\nThey had a rule about no window ACs which I crossed out.\n\
  \nThey had a restrictive rule about what furniture and decorating you can have out\
  \ on your balcony which I crossed out\n\nI asked for an extra day notice (2 rather\
  \ than one) before they entered my rental\n\nI said that they could not show my\
  \ apartment for tours more than 2 months before my moveout, and only to people interested\
  \ in my exact apartment. No using it as a general showroom\n\nI added a few things\
  \ about the landlord's responsibilities in terms of maintenance.\n\nAnyway, since\
  \ I've been living there, a couple other tenants are annoyed with me for having\
  \ different rules. Like, one neighbor called me out for having a big group over\
  \ for DnD, even though we're a quiet respectful group. \n\nAnother time, a neighbor\
  \ was like \"do they all live here, you can only have one guest in the pool\" and\
  \ I said my friends did not, but I had different lease terms that allow 3 guests.\
  \ I even showed a copy of my lease on my phone to them because they didn't believe\
  \ me.\n\nOne more neighbor told me I had to take down the ferns and shade curtains\
  \ I had on my balcony and I said I'd gotten the landlord's permission.\n\nI feel\
  \ like a bunch of my neighbors are unhappy with their leases rules but are taking\
  \ it out on me, wanting me to have the same rules, like \"If I can't have this,\
  \ neither should you.\" And that's frustrating after I went out of my way to negotiate\
  \ different terms.\n\nAITA for following different lease terms I negotiated, Reddit?"
