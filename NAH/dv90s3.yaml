selftext: 'My GF and I met at uni and are part of a group of about 13 people, a mixture
  of singles and couples but 7 girls, 6 guys. We all hang out fairly frequently in
  pairs, 3''s, double dates etc and any other combo you can think of for various activities
  but one thing we''ve always had (since uni, we''re all 25 - 28 now) is been guys/girls
  nights.


  I dunno what the girls normally do, I stopped asking after a while and tbh their
  activities are much more varied (Zoomba, pottery classes, hikes maybe, makeup classes/parties
  etc) than ours.


  The ''guys'' and I exclusively do the (admittedly stereotypical) Steak (or bbq if
  the weather allows), poker, whiskey, weed and cigars (a habit we picked up when
  a friend came back from Cuba).


  My GF has been asking for a while to join us instead of the girls as she finds their
  activities boring or silly. I floated the idea past the guys and was shot down.
  They appreciate her situation but we''ve been doing this nearly 10 things and tbh
  it''s nice to have a space for just the guys to talk and bond etc. and it''s something
  we all value and don''t get many other places.


  MY GF is saying I''m insensitive and sexist. I''ve suggested asking her friends
  to do steak/poker/cigar nights occasionally as my GF does enjoy that stuff but the
  other girls aren''t on board.


  ATM we''re at an impasse - so AITA?


  &#x200B;


  EDIT to add:


  We hang out all the time just the two of us.


  We hang out in/as a mixed group FAR more often than we do guys/girls nights.


  She has ample opportunity to smoke, drink whiskey and play poker with us and takes
  advantage when she wants to.


  She LOVES her friends. They bond over a multitude of interests and experiences.
  Her friends are just more traditionally ''girly'' in a lot of ways.'
