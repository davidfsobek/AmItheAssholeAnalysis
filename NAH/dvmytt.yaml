selftext: "My wife (30) and I (31F) have been married for 5 years. We\u2019ve always\
  \ wanted kids and feel we\u2019re in a good place to now. We always decided I would\
  \ carry, because my wife has some medical issues that would make it hard. Which\
  \ leads us to our issue.\n\nMy wife has a genetic disorder that has her in a wheelchair.\
  \ My family has a host of inheritable diseases that I do not wish to pass down.\
  \ My wife offered for me to use her egg and donor sperm. I said I think it\u2019\
  d be better if we used donor for both, this way our child would not potentially\
  \ inherit her genetic disorder.\n\nShe is offended. She says her genetic disorder\
  \ is apart of her and even if our child inherited it, it wouldn\u2019t be a big\
  \ deal. While I love my wife and have no issue helping her, supporting her, etc.,\
  \ knowingly setting up a child to have this condition would not be fair. I see the\
  \ struggles she goes through and the pain she is in. Her parents didn\u2019t know\
  \ they carried the gene (no one else in the family ever had it) until she came along,\
  \ but we do and we have a chance to make sure our child is healthy. If our child\
  \ turned out not to be, I wouldn\u2019t care. I\u2019d take care of it, support\
  \ it, just as I do my wife. I just feel that considering I also deal with mental\
  \ health struggles and have potential future health risks of my own, trying to give\
  \ our child the best shot would be best. My wife isn\u2019t happy. Ultimately, she\
  \ says she\u2019d be fine with using donor eggs or even us adopting a child in need\
  \ of a home, but she feels like I was just super insensitive.\n\nAm I being an ass\
  \ here? I\u2019m starting to feel bad."
