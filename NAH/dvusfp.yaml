selftext: "So about 4 years ago I went off the deep end and got into drugs. Obviously\
  \ that leads to being an idiot and I found myself arrested with a few misdemeanors.\
  \ The court put me on probation. During that time I got another misdemeanor and\
  \ picked up a \"violation of terms of probation\" which in my state is a felony.\
  \ Keep in mind I've never actually been to jail. A lot of my arrests were a promise\
  \ to appear in court. Nothing malicious to other people.\n\n\nToday.. I am sober.\
  \ I went to rehab. I am still taking therapy, and over all have worked tooth and\
  \ nail to become a functioning member of society.\n\nRight now I work in a resturant\
  \ and I hate it. But it is the only job that rarely background check. I got this\
  \ idea that if I get a degree I can maybe change fields.\n\nI met with a counseller\
  \ at the community college and told her I didnt plan to leave her room with a total\
  \ life plan, but maybe some direction as to what fields I can persue with my back\
  \ ground. I mentioned I was thinking vet tech because I have a friend in the field\
  \ who works with a felon. \n\nShe seemed caught off gaurd at first. But I assumed\
  \ maybe shes not used to dealing with people in my position. So she googled jobs\
  \ felons CAN NOT have. And proceeded to read it to me. The list is LONG, about 3\
  \ mins of listing. She did say I could persue buisness or an entrepreneur degree.\
  \ I told her I didnt have the drive for that. So she exclaimed \"all you want to\
  \ be is a nurse?\". I didnt even say nurse to start with but I did say I wanted\
  \ to work with people.\n\nNow up until this point it took a lot of anxiety to even\
  \ make this appointment. I've spent the better part of the last few years thinking\
  \ my life was ruined. And she pretty much confirmed it. I started to tear up. She\
  \ tried to hug me. But I told her to not touch me. \n\nThe conversation was pretty\
  \ awkward and I told her I'd come back later.\n\nRight after I seriously thought\
  \ about relapsing. What is the point in being sober, even alive if theres no way\
  \ to ever leave my current shit existence? I know I made these choices but I'm trying\
  \ to do better and I feel I've hit a hole.\n\nAnyways, I called my sister who is\
  \ a therapist and she said that woman listing things anyone cant do is totally discouraging\
  \ and unprofessional. \n\n\nI've been sitting on this for a few days. I dont like\
  \ to spite people because I am in the customer service industry, but that was just\
  \ awful."
