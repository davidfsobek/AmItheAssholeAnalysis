selftext: "Ok so I'm trying to figure out AITA?\n\nI work from home doing code writing\
  \ and running reports, etc. I have an office in the back of the house. My spouse\
  \ works outside of the house. We work opposite schedules to avoid high daycare costs.\
  \ Weekends we are both off and split the duties.\_\n\nI start work very early and\
  \ my spouse sleeps in. I keep the baby monitor with me and when the baby wakes up,\
  \ I take a break, wake up my spouse, then I get the baby out of his crib, change\
  \ him, go get his bottle, and then pass him off to my spouse to feed him. At that\
  \ point I go back to work.\_\n\nTypically around 2 hours later I take another break,\
  \ prepare breakfast for our son, like eggs with sausage or whatever and leave my\
  \ spouse to feed him.\_\n\nAfter that, I truly feel as though it's my spouse's responsibility\
  \ to handle the baby. Then once I'm off work, we split the duties until my spouse\
  \ leaves for work, then it's all on me.\_\n\nThe problem is that when I take any\
  \ breaks after that, sometimes to walk around and sometimes just to use the bathroom,\
  \ my spouse gets angry if I don't help with the baby.\_\n\nFor example, the baby\
  \ needed to be changed but my spouse wanted to finish putting dishes away. They\
  \ got angry when I said no, they needed to change the baby then go back to the dishes.\_\
  \n\nI tried pointing out that while they are at work I handle everything, the entire\
  \ time, with no assistance. I also pointed out when they get breaks at work, all\
  \ of their breaks are actual breaks. I think it's only fair I should be able to\
  \ take one or two breaks without having to do anything during them. Just because\
  \ my work is in the house, it doesn't mean I'm not working and I get just as exhausted\
  \ and stressed.\_\n\nAITA for forcing the issue?"
