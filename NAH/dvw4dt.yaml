selftext: "My wife (F26) and I (M26) have been married for 2 years. We met at our\
  \ current workplace, where we both worked as colleagues. \n\nAround 2 months ago,\
  \ our manager left to focus on a different career path, as the position needed filling\
  \ my wife decided to apply for the role (I decided not to just to avoid any conflict).\
  \ She deservingly got the position and technically became my 'boss'\n\nShe was over\
  \ the moon with her new position, excited for the change and looking forward to\
  \ her new role.\n\nLet me mention at this point that I was and still am super happy\
  \ for her but I didn't think things would change this drastically between us. \n\
  \nShe's started to confide in me less and less regarding work stress as she thinks\
  \ I'm not capable to understand what she's going through making me feel like I'm\
  \ beneath her and has spent next to no time with me during work (lunch, breaks).\
  \ She's been extremely hard on me at work aswell as always being on my case. \n\n\
  Without doubt her new position requires more commitment and so she does work more\
  \ than I do, but apparently this gives her the right to always be 'exhausted' to\
  \ put any effort in our relationship. We used to have weekly date nights yet since\
  \ her promotion, we've not been on single one, when I try to organise something\
  \ special for us she always makes some excuse, either she's busy with work or something\
  \ else comes up. \n\nI've tried talking to her, telling her how I feel but I always\
  \ get the response 'well you're not in my position, you don't know how hard I'm\
  \ trying'.\n\nThings were getting stressful at work so I talked to a different team\
  \ manager and got transferred onto his team. When she found out, she immediately\
  \ came to talk to me and was pretty mad that I did that without telling her, saying\
  \ how it makes her look bad and incapable of her new role. \n\nSince then she's\
  \ been avoiding me at work and not been her normal self at home. I saw her crying,\
  \ when I went to try and comfort her she just said it was nothing. \n\nThe next\
  \ couple of days go by and I find out from my team manager that she's going to be\
  \ stepping down back to her normal position, effectively demoting herself. I know\
  \ im  responsible for this situation"
