  \ dove bar soaps, razors, shaving creams, toothpaste/toothbrush\u2019s/mouthwash,\
  \ lotions, face wash, bath bombs etc. I was thinking throw stuff in a basket wrap\
  \ it up nice and give Treat yourself type gift basket. I am going to also add candles,\
  \ a cozy blanket, and some chocolates to each one so it\u2019s not just a bunch\
  \ of hygiene stuff. Will my friends/family think I\u2019m a cheap ass? I also don\u2019\
  t want anyone to think that I think they smell."
