selftext: "I've been pretty sick for the last 3 weeks with an upper respiratory infection\
  \ that is just now starting to go away. \nToday BF's ex calls to inform him the\
  \ kids went to the doctor that day and they both have strep, they will be missing\
  \ school and that they need to remain on their antibiotics while they are here.\n\
  After he told me this I asked if they can please not come over this weekend. Strep\
  \ is highly contagious and you need to be on the antibiotics for 3 days before you\
  \ stop being contagious. It's Thursday here, and they would be coming over tomorrow\
  \ so that would only be 24 hours on antibiotics for them. \nI've missed a lot of\
  \ school and work because I've already been sick. If I get strep I know I will miss\
  \ even more. I got strep a few years ago and I was wrecked for about a week. With\
  \ the semester winding down I cannot miss any more school.\n\nHe says I'm making\
  \ him choose between me and his kids. I kind of see his point, but I'm not asking\
  \ him to never see them again, just skip this weekend. I even said we can have them\
  \ for 2 weekend in a row so we can make up the time with them.\nI want to also say,\
  \ I really like his kids and they like me too. This is nothing against them, just\
  \ the illness.\nThey have high fever and feel lousy, so I figure they probably want\
  \ to stay home in their own beds anyway.\nI'm just a gf, not his wife, so I never\
  \ tell him how to parent. But this is my house too, that I pay equally for, so I\
  \ feel like I should have a say in this issue.\n\nEdit: He has cancelled weekends\
  \ with them before because he has been sick. And I didn't ask him to cancel any\
  \ of the weekends when I've had the URI.\n\nEdit 2: The kids are 11&12. \nAlso,\
  \ I've been with my bf for over 2 years now so the kids have been over here plenty\
  \ of times when sick. Just not with strep. I'm terrified of strep because it knocked\
  \ me on my ass for a full week and then I still felt like crap for days after. My\
  \ doc told me you don't stop being contagious until 72 hours of antibiotics. \n\n\
  I told my bf to ask the kids what they want to do. Both want to stay at mom's, but\
  \ they don't want to hurt bf's feelings.\n\nOk update- Mom messaged me asking me\
  \ to talk to BF about letting them stay home. She said she called him to tell them\
  \ they are sick and won't come over but he insisted they come anyway. How do I post\
  \ a screenshot here?"
