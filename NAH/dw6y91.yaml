selftext: "Background: I\u2019m a college student working for a smaller company in\
  \ which my boss is also in charge of payroll. Nobody else handles anything involving\
  \ employee paychecks. \n\nMy boss was recently diagnosed with an earlier stage of\
  \ cancer. It was detected early enough to be treatable with a high success rate,\
  \ but she is required to be in the hospital for an entire week while undergoing\
  \ treatment. She let all of us know that she would not be at work for the next 10\
  \ days and that she is available by phone or email, but she might not respond for\
  \ a few days.\n\nPay day was the day after she went through her first surgery. I\
  \ noticed that I didn\u2019t receive anything, and thought nothing of it since she\u2019\
  ll occasionally run payroll a day late. The next day came, but still nothing. After\
  \ the weekend passed, I went into work and asked a coworker whether or not they\
  \ were paid, and they said they had received their pay like normal. I planned on\
  \ sending my boss a message after hearing this, but then I realized she was undergoing\
  \ a second surgery that day.\n\nNow that a few days have passed, I want to message\
  \ her to ask why I never received my pay. I won\u2019t be entirely broke if I don\u2019\
  t ask right away, but I have a bill to pay in a couple days, so I\u2019ll need to\
  \ budget more than normal if I\u2019m not paid. WIBTA if I were to message her now\
  \ while she\u2019s still recovering in the hospital?\n\nEDIT: My job is more like\
  \ working for an independent franchise rather than a smaller company, so all of\
  \ the financial aspects of the job are handled by my boss. Besides her, nobody is\
  \ really involved with that aspect of the job. There was no one designated to take\
  \ over that role since she expected to be back after 10 days."
