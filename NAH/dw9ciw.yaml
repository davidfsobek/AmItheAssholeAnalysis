selftext: "At a unit meeting the other day, my boss introduced two new hires, recent\
  \ graduates who are training to become account managers. My boss told them that\
  \ I am one of the top account managers in our unit and asked me what advice I can\
  \ give the new hires on how to succeed at this job.\n\nI said that our job is 30%\
  \ work and 70% luck, sometimes you get big deals with minimal effort and sometimes\
  \ you give it everything you have but the deal still doesn\u2019t push through.\
  \ But what\u2019s important is to have good relationships with your co-workers because\
  \ work is much easier when you have a positive work environment.\n\nAfter the meeting\
  \ my boss talked to me and he was not happy about the advice I gave. He said that\
  \ he wanted the new hires to see me as a role model but instead I embarrassed him\
  \ by encouraging them to be complacent since I said that 70% of the job is luck.\
  \ He said that I know the advice I should give them is to set goals and work hard\
  \ to achieve them as their careers are just beginning but I went with trying to\
  \ sound cool instead of giving them the best advice.\n\nI specifically avoided telling\
  \ the new hires that they should work hard because I don\u2019t work hard myself\
  \ and everyone else in the room knows that. I\u2019m not humble bragging. I was\
  \ always an average employee, I just got lucky these past three years because even\
  \ without asking my clients brought me their friends who also ended up doing business\
  \ with me so the deals basically just fell into my lap. But even now I have a lot\
  \ of lazy days where I procrastinate or I go on sudden leaves just because I don\u2019\
  t feel like working.\n\nI didn\u2019t want to be that person who doesn\u2019t practice\
  \ what she preaches, but should I have told them what they needed to hear instead\
  \ of what I really wanted to say?\n\nEdit: Wow this blew up.\n\nThank you to everyone\
  \ who is worried that I might get fired or I won't be promoted because of what I\
  \ said, thankfully promotions in our company depend on your performance. We have\
  \ guaranteed merit increases as long as we meet their our budgets, and if you go\
  \ over your budget you get a bigger increase. Unless I do something against company\
  \ policies or I don't meet my budget for three straight years my boss also can't\
  \ recommend my termination. Even then it's not my immediate boss who decides if\
  \ I get fired, so I think I'm pretty safe.\n\nI still believe that a big part of\
  \ my achievements in the past three years is down to luck. I didn't do anything\
  \ different than what I did the past five years. I was nice and accommodating to\
  \ my clients before but they didn't refer any deals or the ones they did did not\
  \ push through. I don't know what changed these last three years. But the reality\
  \ is that the clients came to me and from there I just had to type some templated\
  \ proposals.\n\nIn contrast I have coworkers who bust their ass marketing new clients\
  \ on their own, they have good relationships with their existing clients but do\
  \ not get referrals, or they make somersaults to sort out terms and conditions to\
  \ make a deal happen but the client suddenly says he doesn't need the deal anymore.\
  \ That's why I think that I've been lucky and I know this luck is not gonna last\
  \ forever.\n\nBut I see your point that maybe I shouldn't have said what I did at\
  \ a formal meeting like that in front of my boss."
title: AITA? My boss asked me to give advice to new hires on how to excel at work,
  I said our job is 30% work and 70% luck.
