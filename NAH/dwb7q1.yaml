selftext: "So growing up I had this brilliant doggy who was born just a year before\
  \ me. We grew up together and I loved him so much. Now that I have my own baby and\
  \ my own house with my partner I want to get a dog so my wee girl can have the same\
  \ experiences that I had. The only problem...\n\nMy MIL is allergic to dogs, cats,\
  \ hamsters, horses. Basically she is allergic to anything with fur. Anytime she\
  \ sees, or even hears about, a dog she physically recoils and if one touches her\
  \ she gets hives all over the affected area.\n\nNow me and my MIL have a pretty\
  \ good report. But anytime the topic of dogs are mentioned she always breaks out\
  \ the line \u201Cwell if you get one you can count me out for visiting and babysitting\u201D\
  \ and it drives me nuts. \n\nSo basically I need you all to settle this for me.\
  \ I absolutely love dogs! But AITA?\n\n\nUPDATE\n\nSo I talked to my partner and\
  \ we decided to get a doggo. But to go to a hypoallergenic breeder and introduce\
  \ my MIL to the parent doggos to make sure she doesn\u2019t have an allergic reaction\
  \ to them before going ahead with the pup. \n\nFor more info I\u2019ve seen people\
  \ asking for.\n\nMy partner really wants a dog too.\nI\u2019ve owned dogs in my\
  \ adult years and am aware how to take care of them.\nAnd it\u2019s not just because\
  \ I had a dog that I was my little girl to have one. They teach children how to\
  \ play, form connections, make great first friends and protectors. And growing up\
  \ together can make a bond that lasts with someone for a lifetime. That\u2019s what\
  \ I want for her, not to try and watch my life being relived through her."
