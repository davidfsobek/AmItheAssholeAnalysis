selftext: 'I am not Korean.


  A few years back when I was taking Korean class in college, I went to a local community
  craft fair. There were areas where you could do arts and crafts or buying local
  art. There was a Korean church that was creating some form of traditional Korean
  art (Idk it was years ago) and I was curious and came over and joined. Everyone
  was speaking Korean and I thought it would be a good idea to practice my Korean.
  I decided to ask the lady (who was speaking Korean the entire time), heading the
  table in Korean "Am I doing this right?"  and I held up whatever I was working on.


  She gave me a weird look and said, "I can speak English just fine."


  I ended up excusing myself and leaving the table because I felt uncomfortable. I
  didn''t see anything wrong with what I did but I guess she did.


  Was I the asshole/Am I the asshole?


  Edit: clarification that the woman I spoke to was speaking Korean. I didn''t feel
  like I needed to ask for the practice, as she was speaking Korean, only


  Edit 2: by practice, I mean speaking Korean outside a teaching environment. Is that
  really hard to grasp from the context?'
