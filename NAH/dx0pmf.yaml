selftext: "So, my gf bought me a 23 and me test for my last birthday. It has sat on\
  \ my desk for 7 months because I never got around to doing it. She brought it up\
  \ a couple times and last week I said I didn\u2019t want to do the test. I said\
  \ I\u2019d pay her back the money she spent if she wanted. She's been a bit off\
  \ with me every since. \n\nMy reasons for not wanting to do the test are that I\
  \ am happy with my family. My parents divorced when I was 19, but I love them both\
  \ and have a good relationship with them. They\u2019ve both remarried and I get\
  \ along well with my stepparents too. I also have a great relationship with my sisters.\
  \ If there is a big family secret then I\u2019d rather not know, I\u2019d be happier\
  \ living in ignorance. At 32 years old, I feel like the family roles we each fulfill\
  \ are so engrained that DNA is irrelevant at this point. \n\nMy girlfriend is from\
  \ New Jersey and I\u2019m English. We live in Essex, UK. I feel like these tests\
  \ are more popular in America and her interest in it is a cultural thing that I\
  \ just don\u2019t really understand. I\u2019m trying to be sensitive to her, but\
  \ I\u2019ve essentially rejected a gift that she put a lot of thought into and spent\
  \ a lot of money on. I also avoided telling her how I felt about it for a really\
  \ long time, so I don\u2019t know if that makes me the arsehole?"
