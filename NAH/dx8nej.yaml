selftext: 'This is a peculiar situation. My husband is in school and he''s 32. He''s
  been in college since he was 19 and currently has three degrees and working on a
  fourth. Linguistics, computer science, chemistry and working on accounting now.


  The details are misty but he says he gets paid to go to school. Every year he "makes"
  around $27,000 by going to school. This is a mix of grants and scholarships, as
  well as performance based. None of it are loans, none of it he needs to pay back.
  The big one he gets is for indigenous peoples and in 12 years he''s been the only
  applicant (and before an INFO request, his father is full Algonquin). I want to
  clarify he''s not cheating any system and the college actively encourages what he''s
  doing.


  It''s not even that he''s a bad student, he really does give it his all. It''s admirable
  in a way, he''s always top of the class and partakes in extracurriculars.


  I ask him why he doesn''t just find a job and he says the money he makes from school
  is enough for his lifestyle and if he were to begin working, sure he''d make more,
  but he''s in a low-stress, low-responsibility position right now. Plus he just enjoys
  it, too.


  I feel like an asshole suggesting he stop this if it works for him but I want to
  start a family and, well, he''s 32. Not to say mature students aren''t a thing and
  they aren''t bad at all, but at a certain point he should break out of this cycle
  and enter the "real world". I''m sure his education can basically ensure him a job
  in any of his fields due to the cross discipline of these careers.


  Before I open this jar I want to ask if I was the AITA?'
