selftext: "My girlfriend [F20] and I [M21] recently (3 days ago) had sex and after\
  \ we finished the condom came off. The end of the condom was still outside her and\
  \ nothing else went wrong and everything got caught in the condom, so chances are\
  \ we should be okay and she shouldn\u2019t have to take the pill. \n\nHowever, she\u2019\
  s morally against abortion and if she were to get pregnant, the likelihood is is\
  \ that she wouldn\u2019t abort it, even though we\u2019re both in our early 20s\
  \ and at uni, unable to look after a child in any capacity. I have a part time job\
  \ and she doesn\u2019t work at the moment, so we don\u2019t have a great deal of\
  \ money, especially due to the fact we are students. \n\nWe have spoken about this,\
  \ and I\u2019m concerned that if she is pregnant, she would keep the baby and we\
  \ would be parents at 20. I have not told her that she has to take the pill, I have\
  \ just been worried about the possible outcome so much, that she\u2019s said she\u2019\
  s going to take the pill just so I have peace of mind. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t want\
  \ to take the pill, but she also doesn\u2019t want a kid or an abortion. She is\
  \ morally against abortion. If there\u2019s any chance she\u2019s pregnant, I want\
  \ to negate that as much as possible so we don\u2019t have to sacrifice our lives\
  \ for this, but the only reason she\u2019s taking the pill is to put my mind at\
  \ ease. \n\nShe\u2019s convinced she couldn\u2019t be pregnant, but I just want\
  \ to make sure, especially because abortion seems off the cards for her entirely,\
  \ and there is no way we could manage being parents now. \n\nAITA for stressing\
  \ about this and worrying about it to the point that she\u2019s gonna take the pill?\n\
  \nAlso: the morning after pills you can get are effective up to five days after,\
  \ so we still have time."
