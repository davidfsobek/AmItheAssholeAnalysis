selftext: "My daughter (15) is 5'6 and the last time she weighed herself at the doctor's\
  \ office she was at 238lbs. She is morbidly obese.\n\nShe was always a chubby kid\
  \ who loved food and hated activity no matter how much her dad and I tried to get\
  \ her to dance, play sports, go on walks with our dog etc. she would refuse. I regret\
  \ not taking her to a nutritionist earlier, but I thought that she would go into\
  \ puberty and her weight would eventually be okay. Unfortunately, when she was 11\
  \ her dad and I decided to get a divorce. No special reason, it just wasn't working.\
  \ We coparent well, we're friendly, we go on trips with out daughter etc., but the\
  \ divorce impacted her negatively at first. \n\nShe started gaining a lot of weight\
  \ around that time so we decided to take her to a nutritionist who recommended therapy\
  \ for her. She initially lost about 15lbs but she was already very dependent on\
  \ food. Now, she's a food addict. Her emotional eating was something she used to\
  \ cope with the divorce until she adjusted, but now it's all about compensating\
  \ for not having friends, compensating for not being ''pretty'', compensating for\
  \ not being liked by boys etc. \n\nShe still goes to therapy regularly, she doesn't\
  \ suffer from depression or another health condition that might cause her weight\
  \ gain, she is simply addicted to food and at her vulnerable age, mentioning her\
  \ weight to her makes her very upset and uncomfortable. Her dad and I both know\
  \ this and it's been causing arguments between us. I'm a very active, fit person\
  \ and I try to lead by example - no junk food allowed in the house, I cook as much\
  \ as I can or I get healthy meal delivery - and this makes me the bad guy.\n\nShe's\
  \ into the whole body acceptance movement and she sold the story to her dad who\
  \ now allows her to raid his pantry and they eat junk together just so he wouldn't\
  \ upset her because she's daddy's little girl. He's happy that he gets to be the\
  \ good guy and I'm the villain who doesn't want her daughter to settle because I\
  \ want her to live past 35. I encourage her to love herself, I want her to embrace\
  \ how amazing she is but I don't want her to accept her condition as something normal\
  \ that can't be changed. I'm tired seeing how miserable she is because of her weight\
  \ and I'm tired of thinking about all the diseases that could kill her. \n\nI found\
  \ a great weight management treatment facility (*edited instead of camp because\
  \ it's very different from the infamous fat camps) for teens that's 6 hours away,\
  \ I've done my research but her dad doesn't want to sign for her to go there from\
  \ January to July. We can visit her and she can come home once a month, she can\
  \ go to school there, make friends and get healthy. He says that I'm being a selfish\
  \ asshole and that our daughter doesn't want to go. She told me that she will think\
  \ about it but I think that her dad is loving his role as her superhero because\
  \ they've bonded in the past months, and will encourage her not to go.\n\nAITA?\n\
  \n__EDIT:__ Lots of repetitive question and comments. Please look through my comment\
  \ history, thank you.\n\n__EDIT2:__ Again, I've explained everything about this\
  \ treatment facility, her current therapy and approach to her eating disorder, the\
  \ fact that the choice is ultimately hers, yes we do have a dog and no she doesn't\
  \ want to walk him, no this isn't a quick fix, no I don't think my daughter hates\
  \ me.\n\n__EDIT3:__ I sound like a broken record, put please read through my comments\
  \ before asking the same things over and over! There's a word limit here and obviously\
  \ not everything fits in the post. The facility does have therapists, specialists,\
  \ doctors and all types of health professionals. They do have ED programs that she\
  \ would be a part of and she would be in touch with her current therapist because\
  \ she has a hard time opening up to new people, so that would help her. I double\
  \ and triple checked everything and talked to so many parents and employees, but\
  \ it's ultimately her choice. My fear is that her dad will cloud her judgment by\
  \ bribing her with food.\n\n__EDIT4:__ Thank you guys for all of your responses.\
  \ I've received a lot of great advice, your own experience with ED, personal stories,\
  \ support and empathy. I appreciate all of it. I'll no longer be replying to comments\
  \ because I find myself trying too hard to reach people who are twisting my words\
  \ and using them against me. Maybe I'll post an update within the next few weeks\
  \ when something happens, but things definitely will change around here. Again,\
  \ thank you all!"
