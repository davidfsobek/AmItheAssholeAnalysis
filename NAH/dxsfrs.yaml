selftext: "I (27f) Just got engaged and already the drama has started. \n\nBackstory,\
  \ my religious sister (29f) moved overseas 7 years ago to be a missionary . We see\
  \ each other occasionally, like once every few years and often times with our large\
  \ extended family (funerals, holidays, reunions, etc) . Honestly we've drifted apart,\
  \ partially my fault because I suck at skyping while she is awake (9hr time difference),\
  \ but mostly because we just are very different people. Mainly, I'm not religious\
  \ at all anymore and her religion impacts her whole being. I'm ok with this, we\
  \ will always be sisters, we dont have to be best friends. Before she left we were\
  \ getting really close, but then she moved away. She has only met my fiance like\
  \ 2 times since we have been together 4 years. \n\nImportant note, she is a very\
  \ anxious and awkward person who is constantly worrying about everything, I'm very\
  \ laid back and not much bothers me. \n\n\nThe last time she and I saw each other\
  \ I visited her by myself. It was an awkward trip. She had expectations in her head\
  \ that we would pick up right where we left off 7 years and be best friends again.\
  \ It didnt really go that way, I was jetlagged and I just kept realizing how deep\
  \ our differences go. I still had a good time on the trip, but I think she has some\
  \ hurt feelings because of her unmet expectations .\n\nShe is coming home for 9\
  \ months this year, one month before we are planning to have the wedding. \n\nAnyway,\
  \ my mom the other day was like \"your sister told me she was hoping you'd ask her\
  \ to be in your wedding.\"\n\nI wasn't planning on her being a bridesmaid, we just\
  \ aren't that close. I don't want to hurt her feelings. I was planning on having\
  \ 3 close friends as my bridesmaids, ones who know my fiance and have supported\
  \ us throughout the recent years that were not easy for us. I dont want to already\
  \ sound like a bridezilla, but I'm not responsible for her feelings on my own wedding\
  \ day. If I have her as a bridesmaid, she won't be able to help plan, or attend\
  \ any showers or parties, plus she will only have a few weeks to find a dress because\
  \ she lives overseas. I'm also afraid of making her uncomfortable- both my friends\
  \ and my fiance's friends are the kind of people who like to make inappropriate\
  \ jokes & reference the \"good ol days\" where we used to party & do drugs...which\
  \ would make her super uncomfortable since she is so conservative. \n\nMy fiance\
  \ is having his brother be his best man, they are best friends . That only makes\
  \ me feel worse, like the reasons I'm not thinking of choosing her are superficial\
  \ because we are sisters always. \n \n\nEdit Worth noting- she's a very sentimental\
  \ person and I think would be offended and not see my side of this at all. \n\n\
  I'm really torn here.\n\nWill I Be the Asshole if I dont want my sister as my bridesmaid?"
