selftext: "My sister and I don\u2019t have a good relationship. We fought a lot growing\
  \ up but idc about that. What I care about is that I let her borrow $4k a few years\
  \ back and she has yet to repay me. In fact the last couple of times I asked her\
  \ she flipped out on me and told me she\u2019ll pay me when she has the money. About\
  \ a year ago she and her fianc\xE9 went to Disney world for a week. I asked her\
  \ how the trip was and she flipped out and accused me of trying to make her miserable\
  \ because my life is miserable. After that I stopped talking to her completely.\
  \ I wasn\u2019t even invited to her wedding which is next year. I\u2019m ok with\
  \ not going. I\u2019ve made peace with not having her in my life anymore. I\u2019\
  ve made peace with never seeing that $4k ever again. I feel happier that I stopped\
  \ caring.\n\nAnyways a few days ago a friend of mine messaged me on Facebook. It\
  \ was odd because we haven\u2019t spoken in years. He asked me if it was cool if\
  \ he could call me. Again I thought weird but said ok. He calls me and asks me if\
  \ my sister is still engaged to \u201CTim\u201D and I say yes. And then he tells\
  \ me he saw \u201CTim\u201D on a date at the restaurant he works at. He has my sister\
  \ as a friend on Facebook as well so that\u2019s probably how he recognized him.\
  \ \n\nAnyways I haven\u2019t told my sister and don\u2019t plan on it. She screwed\
  \ me and doesn\u2019t want me in her life so I felt it wasn\u2019t my place to say\
  \ anything. Does this make me an asshole?"
