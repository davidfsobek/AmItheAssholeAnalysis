selftext: "My ex and I had a kid together. She never liked the idea of biological\
  \ children, believing that her DNA was \"wrong\" and would produce only monsters\
  \ (family history). When we were married and floating children, she wanted to do\
  \ an egg donor. We had an accidental pregnancy and found out too late to consider\
  \ abortion. She was on edge the entire time, flipping between wanting an abortion\
  \ anyway and wanting testing that was inappropriate for maternal age.\n\nOur son\
  \ was born with down syndrome, and is severely autistic. The problems started immediately.\
  \ When he was brought to her after birth, she started screaming in horror and was\
  \ so off the charts that she needed a 72 hour hold. I took to parenting, she...did\
  \ not. She had postpartum depression on steroids, with a side of hatred, both for\
  \ herself and life. She went in the psych ward five times in the remainder of our\
  \ marriage. His diagnosis of severe autism was the end.\n\nWhen we divorced, she\
  \ not only forfeited custody, but signed away her parental rights. Her only right\
  \ is to pay child support. She dressed it up in court record, but told me afterwards\
  \ that she wanted to move on from her \"sin\", it was fine that she is leaving because\
  \ trying to love him is a wasted effort, and that if CPS came knocking for her to\
  \ take the boy, she'd make sure she never passed a drug test. \n\nShe pays max child\
  \ support, which only covers therapy and maybe a few items of clothing a month.\
  \ I've heard through the grapevine five years on that she's married someone, and\
  \ adopted his young daughter. A friend of hers is apparently dying, understands\
  \ why she abandoned our son, and wants a steady caregiver for his daughter when\
  \ he goes. \n\nShe's been able to reduce her support to only $750 from $1100 as\
  \ she now \"has another child\" to support. Her new job pays much less, and it's\
  \ a lower col area so jobs pay less. I fought the decrease in court and lost. It's\
  \ horrible. I'm really feeling the financial strain. Our son hasn't had much improvement,\
  \ and I can't give more therapy with this massive income cut. \n\nI directly contacted\
  \ my ex to plead our son's case to her, and after she said that she couldn't afford\
  \ it and she was only a parent in legal child support duties only, I went off saying\
  \ that she in no way even deserves a \"fresh\" child. AITA here?"
title: AITA for the telling my ex that she doesn't deserve to have a child after her
  actions towards our son?
