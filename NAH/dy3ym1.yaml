selftext: "I was with my late fianc\xE9 Blake for four years until he passed away\
  \ from an accident a few months before we were supposed to get married. He was the\
  \ light of my life - I was not okay for a long time after he died, and one of the\
  \ things that I did to comfort myself was continue to wear the engagement ring he\
  \ gave me. It was my reminder that part of him was still there with me, and will\
  \ always be.\n\nA few years later I met my current fianc\xE9 Zach. We\u2019ve been\
  \ together for two years now, I am very happy with him and had no qualms about saying\
  \ yes when he proposed. \n\nI used to wear Blake\u2019s engagement ring on my right\
  \ ring finger. Zach and I talked about it when we started getting serious, and he\
  \ said he was okay with me still wearing Blake\u2019s ring because he knew how important\
  \ Blake\u2019s memory is to me. When Zach and I got engaged, I moved Blake\u2019\
  s ring to the middle finger of my right hand while Zach\u2019s ring is now on my\
  \ ring finger.\n\nRecently Zach\u2019s sister Anna talked to me and asked if I planned\
  \ on continuing to wear my engagement ring with Blake. I was surprised but told\
  \ her yes and asked why she thought to ask. She said she just thinks it\u2019s awkward\
  \ that I was still wearing another man\u2019s ring now that I\u2019m engaged to\
  \ her brother, and have I considered how weird it would be if I am wearing Blake\u2019\
  s ring during my wedding with Zach. She also said that Zach had to spend a lot of\
  \ time thinking about how he was going to propose to me so it wouldn\u2019t be awkward\
  \ because he knew that Blake\u2019s ring would already be on my finger when he gives\
  \ me his ring.\n\nHonestly I would still like to wear Blake\u2019s ring because\
  \ it\u2019s important to me and gives me comfort. But I understand how some people\
  \ would think it\u2019s weird or awkward, and I accept that maybe my feelings about\
  \ Blake are clouding my judgment and I am being unfair to Zach. \n\nAITA?"
