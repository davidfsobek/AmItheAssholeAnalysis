selftext: "\nMy girlfriend and I have been together for about 7 years now. Her family\
  \ is amazing and I love them all minus her brother. I don\u2019t know if he was\
  \ a bad seed or what happened with him exactly but he is/was a piece of shit. \n\
  \n\nHe has not only stolen from every single member of his family but also robbed\
  \ me and my girlfriend blind while we were at work with his junkie friends including\
  \ STEALING OUR DOG. Luckily we got him back from the drug dealer he had gave him\
  \ too. But the priceless (to my gf)  jewelry from my girlfriends Grandma and my\
  \ great grandpas war medals were never recovered. The next time I saw him he mocked\
  \ me about it too and called me \u201Ccry baby bitch\u201D for being upset of some\
  \ \u201Chunks of metal\u201D. \n\n\nOver the years I\u2019ve learned to never ever\
  \ believe one word that comes out of his mouth and the only thing he really cares\
  \ about is his next fix (drug of choice is heroin but he\u2019d do anything). Maybe\
  \ back in the day he had some redeeming qualities but at this point he has been\
  \ nothing but toxic and a stress in our lives. \n\n\nSo we got the call the other\
  \ day that he had passed away. He was found in a trap house with a needle in his\
  \ arm. His parents are beside themselves understandably and my girlfriend has been\
  \ struggling with the news as well. I feel very deeply for the pain my gf is going\
  \ through and my \u201Cin-laws\u201D as well, I can\u2019t imagine losing a kid.\
  \ But I won\u2019t lie, my personal level of grief for this dude is indifference.\
  \ Which is shitty I know but I can\u2019t move on from what he\u2019s done to us\
  \ in the past. \n\n\nNow this is where \u201Cam I the asshole\u201D comes in. This\
  \ upcoming weekend my dad and I had been planning to go on a big trip together.\
  \ He\u2019s the greatest dude in the world and last year was diagnosed with colon\
  \ cancer stage 3. He\u2019s slowly but surely losing his ability to do every day\
  \ things and the pain/chemotherapy is making it hard for him to want to do things.\
  \ But he\u2019s been looking forward to our trip which has been planned for about\
  \ 8 months. And paid for. \n\n\nNow my girlfriend\u2019s brother\u2019s funeral\
  \ is scheduled for the same weekend as this trip. I told her that I feel for her\
  \ family and love them all and will support them in their grief but I don\u2019\
  t want to cancel this trip with my dad. Her brother has been nothing but heart ache\
  \ and my awesome dad who has never let me down in his life doesn\u2019t deserve\
  \ to miss this trip or lose out on our money (which we would since this is cancelling\
  \ literally 6 days before) because the inevitable happened. \n\n\nMy girlfriend\
  \ is beyond hurt and says I am huge jerk for missing something like this for her\
  \ family to \u201Cgo off and have fun with my dad.\u201D When I tried to point out\
  \ that my dad is only getting sicker and I also might not have him for long she\
  \ didn\u2019t want to hear it and called me selfish. \n\n\nSo AITA?"
