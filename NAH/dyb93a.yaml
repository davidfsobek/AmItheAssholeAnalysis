selftext: "I just got back from the most disappointing experience I've had at the\
  \ dog park so far.\n\nI have a dog that just turned one last month. She is a chihuahua/rat\
  \ terrier mix, about 14lbs. Smol pupper. She is very social and playful and loves\
  \ going to the dog park to play with other dogs.\n\nI just moved to a new city last\
  \ month, where thankfully there is a dog park super close to my house. Both parks\
  \ - my old one and new one - are separated into two sides. The old park was separated\
  \ by dog size, while the new one is separated into \"active\" and \"less active\"\
  .\n\nI have been taking her onto the active side for the last month and haven't\
  \ had any issues. Most of the dogs there are pretty big, but she plays well and\
  \ gets along with pretty much any kind of dog. She absolutely loves to play and\
  \ be chased by the bigger dogs (she think she is big dog). A few people at the park\
  \ have told me how they love how well my smol dog is able to keep up with and play\
  \ with the big bois and girls. \n\nI brought her today and there were about maybe\
  \ about 8 other dogs there, all pretty big (50+lbs). Normally this doesn't really\
  \ matter (she wrestles with my friend's 120lb dog sometimes), but there were two\
  \ dogs that were interested in playing with her that were playing too rough. They\
  \ both kept growling while playing (I know this is normal, but it makes my dog nervous)\
  \ and were being too rough when wrestling, causing her to roll all over the ground\
  \ and get stepped on. I picked her up and moved her to the other side of the dog\
  \ park, but they found each other again. My dog actually liked playing with them\
  \ (she kept going back for more...) but these dogs were playing like she was a big\
  \ dog and I got nervous. They are both wrestling her, nudging her with their snouts\
  \ and shes getting tossed up in the air and doing double barrel rolls all over the\
  \ place. Basically a ragdoll. I had to stop it again (with the help of the other\
  \ dog owners) and since I just got there like 5 minutes ago, I took her to the \"\
  less active\" side.\n\nOn that side, there was an older woman there with two small\
  \ dogs, my dog's size. My dog just followed one of them around for a while and then\
  \ wanted to play, so she started doing the play bow and barking. One of the dogs\
  \ got very defensive and the other was like wtf is going on. They just didn't seem\
  \ to be very social dogs and weren't interested in playing, but my dog is very persistent.\
  \ They just kept barking and growling at her. The owner comes over and says that\
  \ my dog \"seems pretty active\" in a snarky tone. I didn't know what to say to\
  \ that. I just went home a short while late.\n\nI felt bad, but at the same time,\
  \ I didn't know what to do. My dog was going to get hurt at the active side, but\
  \ was too active for the less active side, apparently. At the same time, I want\
  \ to respect the rules of the park. I feel like those who have small, very active\
  \ dogs, can't win. So what do I do? AITA?\n\nEDIT: Thank you everyone for the responses.\
  \ I read them all. I feel like the best course of action would be that if something\
  \ like this happens again, I will just leave.  It sucks, but I understand that I\
  \ shouldn\u2019t ruin other people\u2019s outings. It wasn\u2019t my intention to\
  \ do so, nor am I trying to be entitled. I feel like the following may explain why\
  \ I brought her over to the other side:\n\nThe rules are followed very loosely at\
  \ dog parks...not that it\u2019s ok, but for real. Kids under 8 are not supposed\
  \ to be there and I\u2019ve seen toddlers walking around, getting jumped on by dogs,\
  \ and the parents getting upset when someone asks them to leave. At my old dog park,\
  \ the big dog side was known to be full of rough players....MANY big dogs would\
  \ come over to the small side because they were getting \u201Cbeat up\u201D. And\
  \ these dogs were able to play fine with the small dogs. Many people visit both\
  \ sides, at both parks I have went to. No firearms allowed, and some guy comes in\
  \ waving his gun around, threatening to shoot someone...with no one there to enforce\
  \ them, the rules aren\u2019t always going to be followed. Not that it\u2019s ok...my\
  \ point is is that switching sides is very common. The less active side is often\
  \ empty or has a couple of active, small dogs. I brought her over to the less active\
  \ side before, and she and like 5 other small dogs were running around and all the\
  \ owners were talking and happy...it\u2019s such an arbitrary rule that I\u2019\
  m not sure it can really be enforced. When I took her over there today, I didn\u2019\
  t really think anything of it because it\u2019s so common. That\u2019s why I was\
  \ a little shocked to read all of these YTA. I thought that maybe the other persons\
  \ dogs might be playful, but the owner didn\u2019t want them with the big dogs (other\
  \ owners I\u2019ve spoken to on the less active side have said that\u2019s why they\
  \ have their dog on that side).\n\nAlso, I feel like some people think I just let\
  \ my dog harass the other dogs for like an hour. We were there for like 10 minutes.\
  \ She spent the first five minutes following a dog around, peeing with him, which\
  \ he was ok with. They were just walking around and peeing. They didn\u2019t start\
  \ getting pissed until she initiated play. I saw that they were not interested so\
  \ I redirected her. She did it again, so I redirected her and moved her away from\
  \ them. She tried a few minutes again, and that\u2019s when I took her home. My\
  \ dog was not a physical threat to them, just barking and doing the play bow, and\
  \ I did not just stand there and watch. A lot of assumptions here."
