selftext: "Alright this is the hardest thing I've done.\n\nI'm a dungeon master for\
  \ dungeons and dragons, and I currently have a party of 7 people.\n\nOne of the\
  \ people is autistic, and I don't know whether it's mild or not.\n\nHe's not necessarily\
  \ a bad person, he's wonderful. However he has a lot of problems.\n\nFirst of all,\
  \ he made his own species with \"Technological advances.\" Which is basically robot\
  \ parts.\nI have stated that all characters must be from at least the Renaissance\
  \ time period. Nothing in the modern time period. Despite me stating this multiple\
  \ times and telling him no, he's insisted on it. So I let him slide.\n\n\nSecond,\
  \ he has the tendency to stay away from the rules. He'll roll a dice get a horrible\
  \ number then beg to roll again, I'll tell him no and then he'll proceed to blast\
  \ and beg me more. When I give in he'll get another lower number and ask to roll\
  \ again. And as stated about the character. He'll also ask me about being a dungeon\
  \ master for a session, and I'll always tell him no.\n\nThird, he interupts and\
  \ is fairly loud. This is just a nitpicky thing but he's always interuppting and\
  \ he's loud.\nWe've told him time and time again; wait till we're finished. \n\n\
  And lastly, he has tantrums. When we tell him no it's all good, but we tell him\
  \ no again and he starts complaining.\n\nThis is a hard decision, and seeing the\
  \ actions leads me to believe I will be.\nCan I get some advice?"
