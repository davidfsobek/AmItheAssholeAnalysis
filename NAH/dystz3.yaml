selftext: "Me and my buddies have a weekly movie night where we all get together and\
  \ watch a film, normally a classic or an older one because we are all film buffs.\
  \ We take turns choosing. For this past week I chose Pier Pasolini\u2019s adaptations\
  \ of The Canterbury Tales.\n\nIt\u2019s a pretty famous art house film and in line\
  \ with what we normally watch, although it does contain an excessive amount of nudity\
  \ to the degree some have historically (and inaccurately) call it soft core porn.\
  \ The original tales by Chaucer are pretty dirty and this film doesn\u2019t hide\
  \ any of it. This is an explicit NC-17 movie.\n\nAfterwards one of my friends pulled\
  \ me aside and said everyone thinks it\u2019s weird I picked an erotic film for\
  \ movie night. Well he had picked Ichi The Killer a few weeks prior, and that film\
  \ contains excessive grizzly violence.  It\u2019s also NC-17.\n\nI enjoyed Ichi\
  \ but I told him that it\u2019s a stupid double standard if he\u2019s going to pick\
  \ super violent films that I can\u2019t pick sexualized films. Plus no one left\
  \ the screening or objected to it at the time. \n\nWe got in a somewhat heated debate\
  \ where he basically said \u201CMovie violence is fake but movie sex is still sex.\u201D\
  \ I told him that was stupid and he stomped off angry.\n\nI could have picked something\
  \ else granted but I wasn\u2019t trying to ruffle any feathers I just wanted to\
  \ see a good movie. Am the asshole here?\n\nEDIT: Some people have pointed out I\
  \ should have mentioned Ichi is a fairly sexual film as well; there\u2019s less\
  \ nudity overall than Canterbury but there is some rape and sexualized violence."
