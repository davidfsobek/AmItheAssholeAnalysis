selftext: "I got married on Saturday, and it was absolutely amazing except for one\
  \ thing: my parents showed up late. They knew the ceremony time, and my husband\
  \ and I made it very clear to everyone, both in the invites and in person, that\
  \ we were going to start exactly at that time. The venue cost us a lot of money\
  \ (we paid for the entire wedding ourselves) and we were only able to use it for\
  \ a limited amount of time, so we wanted to make every minute count. \n\nSo the\
  \ wedding day came, and half an hour before we were scheduled to start, my parents\
  \ still hadn't showed up. My husband and I both called them multiple times but nobody\
  \ answered. We waited and waited, and still heard nothing. Finally, the start time\
  \ arrived and my parents still weren't there. I was really pissed off at this point.\
  \ The wedding coordinator asked if I wanted to go ahead and start the wedding, and\
  \ I said yes. All of our other guests were already there, and we wanted to be considerate\
  \ of their time. \n\nMy parents showed up 15 minutes later and missed the entire\
  \ ceremony. It turns out they did leave early but got rear-ended at a traffic light\
  \ and had to deal with insurance, police, etc. They only have a landline, no cellphones,\
  \ so they couldn't get in touch with me. Obviously there's no way I could have known\
  \ this.\n\nI'm still frustrated with them for not making more of an effort to get\
  \ to the venue early, and they're furious at me for not delaying the wedding 15\
  \ minutes so they could be there. AITA?"
