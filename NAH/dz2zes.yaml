selftext: "I\u2019m writing this for my mom and my aunts. I just want to know what\
  \ random people from the internet think. \n\nMy family has a mausoleum where most\
  \ of our deceased relatives (from my grandfather\u2019s generation to ours) are\
  \ interred. It\u2019s where my Uncle Ben, my mom\u2019s oldest sibling, is interred.\
  \ His wife, Aunt Tina, recently died and most of our and her relatives assumed that\
  \ she would also be laid to rest in the family mausoleum but my mom and aunts refused.\
  \ \n\nUncle Ben and Aunt Tina didn\u2019t have children but they supported Aunt\
  \ Tina\u2019s family, who were not so privileged. Uncle Ben bought houses for Aunt\
  \ Tina\u2019s siblings, sent their kids to school and paid their monthly bills.\
  \ In turn, they ran errands for him, drove for him and cleaned his house. My mom\
  \ and aunts had an axe to grind about this because Aunt Tina\u2019s siblings never\
  \ looked for actual jobs, they just continued to depend on Uncle Ben even when his\
  \ businesses were no longer doing well.\n\nWhen Uncle Ben got sick, my mom and aunts\
  \ urged him to stop supporting Aunt Tina\u2019s family and save money for himself\
  \ because his treatment was expensive. Aunt Tina got angry and told my mom and aunts\
  \ to mind their own business. My aunt said that if she really cared about Uncle\
  \ Ben she wouldn\u2019t have let her siblings leech off him for years. Not-so-nice\
  \ words were thrown back and forth, and Aunt Tina and my mom and aunts have hated\
  \ each other openly ever since. \n\nWhen Uncle Ben died, he was in debt and one\
  \ of my aunts ended up paying his hospital bills. A year later at a family event\
  \ our relatives invited Aunt Tina to, she introduced her new boyfriend, calling\
  \ him the greatest love of her life. My mom said she was shameless to say that a\
  \ guy she has known for a year is her greatest love and not my Uncle who she was\
  \ with and supported her family for years. Aunt Tina said she was allowed to move\
  \ on and her romantic life was none of my mom\u2019s business. \n\nAunt Tina died\
  \ recently from an accident. Her relatives and some of our relatives think that\
  \ she should be with Uncle Ben because she is Uncle Ben\u2019s wife and part of\
  \ our family, she took care of him when he was alive, and he did love her dearly.\
  \ My mom and aunts contend that it would be an insult to Uncle Ben to have her there\
  \ because she and her family just took advantage of him when he was alive, and she\
  \ herself said that the greatest love of her life is her new boyfriend so she can\
  \ be buried somewhere else where her boyfriend can be laid to rest with her when\
  \ he dies.\n\nAunt Tina\u2019s relatives say that my mom and aunts are keeping Uncle\
  \ Ben and Aunt Tina apart because of their personal beef with Aunt Tina, and that\
  \ Uncle Ben would want her to be in the family mausoleum with him so it\u2019s my\
  \ mom and aunts who are disrespecting Uncle Ben.\n\nThoughts?"
