selftext: 'Ok, I know how the title looks, but please hear me out before calling me
  a sexist asshole. My fiancee and I dated for about 6 years and then got engaged
  roughly a year ago, with our wedding next year. Until yesterday, I was under the
  impression that she would take my last name once we got married. This is something
  we''ve discussed and something we''ve both expressed excitement for once we got
  married, so I thought we were on the same page.


  If this was something that we had discussed together, I probably would have reacted
  differently, but when she told me this, she said that this is something that she
  has been considering for the last six months. She says she hasn''t made a decision
  yet, and, should it come down to it, I won''t put up a fight should she choose to
  keep her name, but I still felt a little betrayed that something this important
  was kept from me for so long, so close to the wedding, when we''ve discussed it
  so much before.


  Don''t get me wrong, I would never think to try and make her take my name, I know
  it''s her name to do with as she wants but names mean a lot to people and I''ve
  spent the last 7 years thinking when we got married that we would have a family
  under one name. We''re planning on kids and whenever discussing baby names I wanted
  to make sure they "flowed" well with the last name. When I found out she might not
  take my name, and that a third of the time we had to talk about this was gone, it''s
  like this future I had in my head for the both of us just kind of fell apart. I
  know that''s a bit dramatic, but this was something I was looking forward to in
  marrying her.


  So her reasoning is she''s started thinking that changing her name would be like
  cutting a tie with her family, and that her name is her identity and is what helps
  her feel close with her family. She also mentioned that taking the husband''s name
  used to be to show that the husband "owned" the wife, but she said that was a small
  part of the decision. We''re both all for equality, and when we talked about this
  we also discussed me taking her name, so whatever name we pick it will be for our
  own reasons. She also mentioned my dad, who can be a bit racist at times. My reasoning
  was that she''ll be just as close to her family, regardless of her last name, and
  that I''m not my dad, nor is anyone else in my family. My name is very unique, and
  there are very few of us, and it''s really only my dad giving the name... well,
  a bad name.


  With the sensitivity to sexism nowadays, and also the fact that she hadn''t brought
  this up for 6 months, I''m wondering if I overreacted in getting angry, if I''m
  getting emotions mixed up, if I''m just not thinking clearly because of how I found
  out, etc.


  So Reddit, AITA?


  TL;DR fiancee and I have been planning to use my last name when we get married for
  the last 7 years, now a year before the wedding she tells me she''s been considering
  keeping her name for the last 6 months'
