selftext: 'UPDATE: The leasing office is going to tape notes on ALL tenants doors
  in our building as to not single anyone out. However, we were not the first to complain.
  Our maintenance guy also caught them smoking in the breezeway of our building and
  told them to cut it out. Hopefully the note helps, if not, I don''t care enough
  to make it a bigger issue and I''m only here for the next 8 months so smoke em if
  you got em I guess.


  Alright bare/bear with me here...


  My husband and I live in a pretty decent apartment complex, we''re on the top floor,
  and we are cool with most of our neighbors. We''re 90% sure about which neighbor
  is smoking the devils lettuce, as it only really started when our next-door neighbors
  new roommate moved in.


  I have nothing against smoking, in any capacity, but it''s literally all our apartment
  has smelled like the last few months. It''s starting to permeate our clothes and
  furniture it''s so bad. My husband and I both work for the government (and are drug
  tested) so this is not ideal. At first (before we realized what was actually going
  on) we thought a skunk had sprayed near our apartment and was just coming in through
  a window. Well, it''s winter now, no windows are open, and every day we wake up
  to and come home to SKUNK. We have told the apartment complex about this, and nothing
  has changed.


  WIBTA if I left a note on this neighbors door? Something to the effect of "Hey fellow
  apartment dwellers, pot is fun. However, consider blowing the smoke out into a paper
  towel roll that has a dryer sheet at the end. Or vape it. Or eat it. My entire apartment
  smells like skunky pot and I''m over it. Love, your neighbors"


  Thoughts?


  Edit: When we messaged the complex about it, we didn''t single out them or their
  apartment, just said "someone in our building." They actually have since responded
  saying that they''d "send a message to our building about it," so we''ll see what
  happens! I''ll hold off on the note/talking to them in person for now, but if it
  continues I''m definitely considering buying two smoke buddies and wrapping them
  up nicely in Christmas paper with a little (not aggressive) card.


  Edit 2: Enough people are asking so I wanted to clarify, **I do not live in a state
  where it is legal.**'
