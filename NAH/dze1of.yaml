selftext: 'I have been married for 4 years, my parents had me very young. High school
  young. I have 4 other siblings within 10 years of my age. My husband and I have
  been struggling with infertility for 2 years now. My parents told me that they are
  having another baby, there will be more than a 25 yr age gap between myself and
  the new baby. When they told me I started bawling. In a way that I had to leave
  the room. They were not happy tears, and while I was not mad at them I felt....
  just bad. You don''t expect your parents to lap you in the having children dept.
  My reaction led to my mother crying and my Dad was just dead silent. After I had
  calmed down I came back out and told them that I was happy for them and of course
  I was excited to be a big sister again. But in the days after this news was broke
  2 of my siblings have come to me and told me I was incredibly selfish and an asshole.
  I am coming around to the idea of having a new sibling but I still find myself heartbroken
  that my parents are having another baby but here I am unable to conceive. So AITA?


  Edit: I have apologized, I did the next day. I told them that they have been great
  parents to the children they already have and my reaction was just because of my
  own circumstances and had nothing to do with them. My siblings know I have apologized
  but are still mad at me. Being the oldest sibling of a large family has been one
  of the best parts of my life.


  Edit2: Quite a few people have been asking these 2 questions. So first of all, I
  was not told one on one. Everyone was over for dinner at my house. Siblings, parents,
  and husband. Second of all they are in their 40s and they were not planning on another
  baby. This was a complete surprise which was part of the shock. Thank you to those
  who have left supportive comments. And thank you to those who believe I''m in the
  wrong, it''s good to get a non biased opinion so maybe I can be better in the future.


  Edit3: Yes, my parents know about our infertility issues.  My siblings know also,
  or at least I assume they do since I''ve talked about it with my oldest younger
  sibling. 2 are still in highschool while the other 2 are 20 and 18.


  Last and final edit! My Mom and I had a good teary conversation together this afternoon.
  I started tearing up because I had upset her and that was absolutely not my intention
  and I didn''t know how to get that across to her. She cried because she genuinely
  didn''t know I was having such a hard time. Of course she knew there were issues
  with trying to conceive but (believe it or not) I usually keep my emotions in check
  and never, EVER cry im public. Which is why my parents were so shocked. Everything
  is fine between my parents and me. My siblings.. I''m hoping they''ll come around.
  As far as everyone telling me to keep my emotions in check in the future; I''m working
  on it. I see a therapist every 2 weeks but made an extra appt this week to hopefully
  work through some feelings about this new life event. Thank you for all the supportive
  comments and wishing my husband and me the best of luck. It is so insanely appreciated.


  Okay, so I lied. THIS is the last update. Idk if anyone will ever see this but I
  took a test today and I am also pregnant. It is shocking and still extremely early
  so who knows if it will stick. I actually can''t believe it even with taking 3 tests.
  But. Anyways, thanks to everyone for the support.'
