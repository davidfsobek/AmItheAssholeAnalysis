selftext: 'My parents are really hard to buy for. My mum has really eclectic taste
  and my dad is a rich ol boomer who has already bought himself everything he wants
  and generally doesn''t like gifts, but will still get sad if you don''t get him
  something. I''m going to be home for Christmas for the first time in 3 years and
  I''m really stuck on what to get them. It needs to fit in my luggage but be thoughtful
  because i havent seen them in ages.


  My partner and I paid way too much money to get some really nice professional photos
  done with us and our dog. They''re fun photos, not stuffy or awkward. I only see
  my parents once a year so I was thinking it might be a nice gift, especially for
  my dad who doesnt have social media so doesn''t see any of our updates or photos.
  but part of me thinks it''s a bit weird to give someone a photo of yourself and
  that they might think I was being cheap or something?'
title: WIBTA if I gave my parents a (nice, framed) "family photo" of myself, my partner
  and my dog for Xmas?
