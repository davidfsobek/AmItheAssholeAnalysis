selftext: "I (25F) have been dating my boyfriend for 4 years, he has a 5 year old\
  \ with an ex, I have a 6 year old with a previous partner as well.\n\nI suggested\
  \ we all try to make the family seem as normal as possible which is why all three\
  \ of us pick both children up from school no matter who\u2019s day it is.\n\nI have\
  \ full custody of my son and my partner has 50/50 custody of his daughter \n\n\n\
  Well today my boyfriends daughter came out with a drawing, she said it was for her\
  \ mummy and all of us  automatically assumed it was for her mum, until she handed\
  \ it to me.\n\nI accepted the picture (obviously) and this has led to an argument\
  \ where her mother believes I should\u2019ve told the child I\u2019m not her mummy\
  \ but she can call me something else and that if it\u2019s a drawing for mummy she\
  \ should give it to her mummy, apparently I\u2019m an AH for not doing that \n\n\
  \nAITA?"
