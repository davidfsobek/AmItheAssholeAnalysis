selftext: 'I go to a small STEM school in Florida.


  I don''t like it here, in part because there are very few professors that can actually
  speak English effectively enough that people don''t have to strain their ears to
  understand what they''re saying. The professors in question are typically either
  East or South Asian and do not speak English as their primary language.


  I''ve tolerated it for over a year now but I''m getting tired of having to self-teach
  every day what I feel should be comprehensibly taught during lectures. I''ve had
  friends who feel the same way but I am generally hesitant about bringing it up because
  I''m worried it''s racist of me to feel this way.


  WIBTA for citing this as a reason I''m withdrawing? Am I an entitled racist? :/'

  a reason to leave my school?
