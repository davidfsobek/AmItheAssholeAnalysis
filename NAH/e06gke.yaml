selftext: "I should explain the context and why first.\n\nShortly after we started\
  \ dating, my girlfriend stayed at my place for a weekend for the first time. She\
  \ didn't live that close so it was an unfamiliar location and she doesn't drive\
  \ and took public transportation.\n\nOne morning we had sex before going out to\
  \ eat for breakfast. I recommended a nearby restaurant and we drove out. While we\
  \ were waiting to be seated, she told me she had to go to the bathroom and gave\
  \ me her phone and left. She did this in the past so I thought little of it, but\
  \ the time spent was longer than a normal bathroom break. I got worried. And I had\
  \ no way to contact her with her phone in my hand. I canceled my place in line.\
  \ I went by the bathroom line, she wasn't there. I went outside almost ready to\
  \ call 911. I found her wandering in the parking lot near my car.\n\nI asked what\
  \ was going on and got barely any verbal response. Eventually I resorted to asking\
  \ yes/no questions that she responded with only a nod or head shake. Via that I\
  \ got her to say she wanted to go to Chipotle instead. We did but she didn't eat\
  \ or talk much and then just asked to go back to my place. We cuddled in bed for\
  \ a few minutes and she started talking again. Basically she has severe PTSD and\
  \ emotional issues (I knew of this beforehand.) She was very upset earlier by a\
  \ sexual act I asked to do (this is a basically PG-13 sub so I won't give details,\
  \ just something not totally vanilla but hardly insane or crazy or unhealthy) that\
  \ she consented to then but felt like she was being sexually utilized. She had an\
  \ emotional reaction in the restaurant. \n\nI apologized but explained she could've\
  \ just said no at the time, or told me afterwards she wanted to talk about something\
  \ she was uncomfortable about. Not saying anything and consenting only to run off\
  \ without her phone in an unfamiliar area is the worst possible reaction. Things\
  \ got better that day later and she said she'd try to be vocal instead about her\
  \ feelings.\n\nHowever because of that incident I refuse to ever hold her phone.\
  \ If she's heading to the bathroom and leaves it with me I'll walk over and hand\
  \ it to her. This is starting to bug her, she said she hasn't done that since and\
  \ I need to start trusting her. Frankly I NEVER leave my phone with anyone so it's\
  \ not something I'm comfortable doing even prior to that, but that incident makes\
  \ it simply not acceptable for me now, period.\n\nAm I being unreasonable?"
