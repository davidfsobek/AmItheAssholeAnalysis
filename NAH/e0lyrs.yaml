selftext: "The short and sweet of it all is that I accidentally spilled some tire\
  \ cleaning acid on the back seat of one of our vehicles, a car she was gifted by\
  \ her grandfather before we got married. It's a 2000 Honda Accord. I didn't notice\
  \ for a day so when I found it, it had eaten away the vinyl. \n\nShe was out of\
  \ town for a few days when this happened and I have a good friend who runs a car\
  \ upholstery shop. So I brought it over there the next day, they matched the vinyl\
  \ and got it all fixed up. When she got home and drove the car she commented how\
  \ clean the back seat looked. I detailed the car while she was gone so I just played\
  \ along. \n\nI told another one of my buddies about this and he said I was a dick\
  \ for hiding this from my wife. My thinking is I got it fixed so it doesn't really\
  \ matter that it got damaged in the first place. But I'm willing to hear people's\
  \ thoughts on this. \n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: just so some people can calm down. I did\
  \ tell her today and she was just impressed that I got it all taken care of before\
  \ she got home"

  it?
