selftext: "This is more for my dad than me. \n\n\nMy family is religious and we have\
  \ certain restrictions when it comes to where we eat out. Each shop that makes their\
  \ own food must be certified by a member of the Jewish community. Its a lot more\
  \ complicated than that but that's all you need to know for this post. \n\n\nWhere\
  \ I live there is no kosher carvel. We are visiting family for the weekend and there\
  \ is a kosher carvel by her house. We had made the 5 hour drive and wanted to stop\
  \ for ice cream because its the only time we get soft serve ice cream. My father\
  \ realized we would only get there right when they close, so he called and asked\
  \ if we could stop by before closing. \n\n\nThey agreed and we went in at 9:52 ish\
  \ and let us order, but they seemed annoyed and didnt seem all too pleasant. They\
  \ werent rude but they shooed us out the door once we got our ice cream. \n\n\n\
  I told my dad beforehand that technically it was their job to allow us to go in\
  \ even if they didn't want to and it wasn't right to keep them past closing (once\
  \ we left they started cleaning up so they were def there past 10). He said bc he\
  \ called and asked, it was ok. \n\n\n\nI think that even if they said it was ok,\
  \ it still wasnt the right thing to do, but idk if it necessarily makes him an asshole.\n\
  \n\nEdit: personally I think we definitely should've waiting until the next day\
  \ since it was so close to closing EVEN though they said it was ok. Technically\
  \ they should allow us to get in and out but we could've waited. \n\n\nMy father\
  \ said that since the employees said it was ok, it was ok. I agree it was a bit\
  \ dick-ish but i didnt know if I should wait. I Understand the annoyance of people\
  \ coming in 10 minutes before closing asking for a meal, but this was ice cream\
  \ which is why i made the post as I figured we were technically on the right, but\
  \ should've waited, and I wanted to know what others thought."
