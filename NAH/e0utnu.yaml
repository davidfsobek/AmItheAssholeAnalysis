selftext: "I (26F) was married to \u201CSam\u201D (30M) for three years. He was bisexual,\
  \ which I knew and accepted. We divorced a year ago, after some infidelity on his\
  \ part. We have no children, and we do not speak.\n\nI work in an admissions office,\
  \ and my coworker \u201CAndy\u201D recently got a new boyfriend. We are not close,\
  \ but I congratulated him and moved on with my day. During lunch break, I was part\
  \ of a larger group conversation, and one of my other coworkers asked Andy for details.\n\
  \nI was shocked when he pulled up a picture of my ex-husband. I blurted something\
  \ out, and everyone else basically went silent. I explained to Andy that I had been\
  \ married to Sam, and that he was a serial cheater and had abused painkillers in\
  \ the past (also true). I ended with saying, \u201C...but if you want to fuck up\
  \ your life, go ahead and date Sam.\u201D\n\nFast forward to Thursday. Andy apparently\
  \ complained about my \u201Chomophobia\u201D to HR, and I explained the situation\
  \ to our rep via email. I think the situation has resolved, but I\u2019m not sure\
  \ if I did anything wrong by warning Andy. I suppose I was trying to wreck my ex\u2019\
  s new relationship more than I was trying to help my coworker. Does that make me\
  \ the asshole? AITA?\n\nEdit: since people are asking, here\u2019s a transcript\
  \ of the conversation. I tried to make it as close to verbatim as possible. Sorry\
  \ I wasn\u2019t more detailed in the post.\n\nMe, seeing the picture: \u201CWait,\
  \ what?\u201D\n\nAndy: \u201C...This is the guy I was telling you about.\u201D\n\
  \nMe: \u201CThat\u2019s my ex-husband!\u201D\n\nAndy: \u201CReally? He knows where\
  \ I work, and he never mentioned you.\u201D\n\nMe: \u201CIt\u2019s absolutely him.\
  \ And I should warn you, he\u2019s a compulsive cheater and he pops pills. He even\
  \ stole a bottle of painkillers from my mom, and I found them hidden in his truck.\
  \ When we were married, he was literally doped up all the time. He\u2019s a train\
  \ wreck, but if you want to fuck up your life, go ahead and date him.\u201D"
