selftext: "Small issue, but I\u2019m honestly not sure if I\u2019m in the wrong. \n\
  \nMatched with a guy on Tinder (he super liked me). We chat for a little bit, maybe\
  \ an hour or two on and off. It\u2019s all going fine. Casual small talk, nothing\
  \ groundbreaking or extraordinarily wonderful, but it\u2019s nice enough. \n\nThen,\
  \ sort of out of the blue, he asks me to take a selfie with his name written on\
  \ a piece of paper to prove I\u2019m not a catfish. \n\nNow, this really rubs me\
  \ the wrong way. I understand safety is important in online dating, but it feels\
  \ like he is accusing me of being a liar, and I haven\u2019t given him any reason\
  \ to think I might be. \n\nI agree to send the pic, but tell him it feels a little\
  \ insulting. But it got me thinking, am I being unreasonable? AITA for finding it\
  \ kinda insulting, and letting him know about it? Is he the asshole for asking me\
  \ to prove that I\u2019m real (very early in the conversation)? What is appropriate\
  \ online/tinder etiquette?"
