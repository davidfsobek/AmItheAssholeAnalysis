selftext: "\nI\u2019m a senior in high school, friends with a sophomore. Sophomores\
  \ get those fake babies in health that cry at 4am to make them not want to have\
  \ sex. Anyway, my friend had his this past weekend. Urban legend at my school is\
  \ that you can throw the baby at the wall and that will deactivate it. Obviously\
  \ that\u2019s not true; so when I said this info to my friend, I was pretty sure\
  \ I sounded sarcastic. He believed me apparently and did it, and ignored the baby.\
  \ PowerSchool just logged his grade and he failed big time. I\u2019ve gotten some\
  \ really angry texts saying it\u2019s my fault. \n\nAITA?"
