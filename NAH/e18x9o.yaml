selftext: "I\u2019ve been with my husband for 11 years now (married for 5) and every\
  \ Christmas since we first started dating we go to his parents house and everyone\
  \ exchanges gifts. So we have to buy gifts for each of his brothers, their spouses/girlfriends,\
  \ their kids, and of course his parents. He has 3 brothers and 5 nieces & nephews.\
  \ One is married, ones divorced and ones single but if they are dating someone we\
  \ have to buy a present for her and her kids (they have yet to date someone without\
  \ kids) \n\nWe have two kids of our own and everyone does their own Christmas morning\
  \ at home then we have to drive over to his parents house to do a second Christmas\
  \ there. I\u2019m to the point to where I just want to shop for my kids. I don\u2019\
  t mind buying for his nieces and nephews but honestly out of all the kids (ours\
  \ included) they are all older and all but two have cell phones. It gets expensive\
  \ shopping for kids these days when they already have electronics and video games.\
  \ Then having to shop for adults when we all work and can buy what we want for ourselves\
  \ becomes really expensive. I don\u2019t even get to shop for my whole family because\
  \ by the time we get gifts for his entire family, shop for my kids, then try to\
  \ get each other something we\u2019ve spent way to much and honestly the joy of\
  \ shopping is gone from stressing over what to get for adults who can shop for themselves.\
  \ \n\nI wouldn\u2019t mind drawing names for Christmas presents at his parents house.\
  \ I feel like his mom enjoys having a big Christmas at her house every year even\
  \ though it\u2019s a second Christmas for everyone. Should we say something this\
  \ year about not wanting to continue this even though his moms feelings will probably\
  \ get hurt?"
