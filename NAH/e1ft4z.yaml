selftext: "For what its worth, I feel terrible about this.\n\n My SO is an incredible\
  \ vocalist, Singing is her passion, at one point she was studying to go professional.\n\
  \nI support her passion  as much as I can. The problem is, we\u2019re adults,  her\
  \ profession has  nothing to do with singing and  she has no real outlet to sing\
  \ these days (we\u2019re not religious so not a whole lot of options for volunteer\
  \ choirs).\n\n Enter my annoyances. I have some auditory triggers, things that just\
  \ drive me crazy. One of them is anyone singing randomly, I HATE people singing\
  \ to the radio in my car (she almost always does). I also get really irritated by\
  \ any sound in her vocal range (she's a soprano). I\u2019ve tried gently talking\
  \ to her about this  before, the conversations have been OK, but she\u2019s clearly\
  \ disappointed/hurt.   Despite that, she continues to sing to the radio or just\
  \ sing  frequently. I\u2019ve given up saying anything to stop hurting her and have\
  \ decided to just walk away when it starts getting to me. Problem is, she likes\
  \ to try and share her passion with me and make me listen while she sings along\
  \ to YouTube videos or the radio. she can tell when I\u2019ve had enough and gets\
  \ hurt.\n\ni feel terrible about not  supporting her passion, but I  don\u2019t\
  \ know what else to do in order to support her. AITA"
