selftext: "My kids, 6&7, each had an iPad mini.  Over the summer they were having\
  \ a rough time, constantly fighting with each other and just being brats in general.\
  \ I lost it one day and took their iPads away, saying they were being sold, never\
  \ to be seen again.  Tears were shed. The iPads were cleaned up, put back into their\
  \ original boxes, accessories packed away, ready for sale...but I couldn\u2019t\
  \ do it. They went into a box in the closet. \nSummer passed, fall passed. The kids\
  \ have been great and I feel they\u2019ve earned them back. \n\nChristmas is coming.\
  \ Money is super tight this year. AITA for wanting to clear the iPads with a factory\
  \ reset, buy a couple new cases as a distraction and regift them their old iPads\
  \ as new ones?"
