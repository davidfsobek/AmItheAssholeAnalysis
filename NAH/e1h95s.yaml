selftext: "AM I THE ASSHOLE\n\nI\u2019m a secondary school teacher. There are more\
  \ and more teens with Diabetes in my classes nowadays. One of these students is\
  \ _not_ handling their self-tracking well. At all. They have been recommended by\
  \ ALL of their teachers to come off of the self-monitoring machine because they\u2019\
  re not yet mature enough to handle it. There\u2019s been no change to their 504-Plan\
  \ to reflect this request from all their teachers. \n\nRecently, the school nurse\
  \ BOSS for the entire district sent a request out to all of us to get trained on\
  \ how to plunge a needle into a child should their levels get too low during a field\
  \ trip. \nDue to this teenager\u2019s immaturity about the monitoring of his medical\
  \ needs, I wouldn\u2019t even TAKE him on a field trip without his own parent as\
  \ a chaperone much less take on the additional burden of being the first responder.\
  \ \n\nSome insight: No, I do not keep all the other medications like Epi-pens on\
  \ me. At the secondary level, kids are not directly chaperoned at a museum, play,\
  \ or theme park. The teens keep their meds on themselves.\n\nEDIT: I can see now\
  \ how the wording of my post makes it seem like I\u2019m asking a personal question.\
  \ I\u2019m learning a lot about how society views the role of Instructional Staff\
  \ nowadays and what they [don\u2019t] know about the modern bureaucracy of Education.\
  \ This is actually a \u201Cfight the power\u201D question."
