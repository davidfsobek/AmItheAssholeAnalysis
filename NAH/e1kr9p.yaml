selftext: 'I own a small gym. One of the nicer luxuries we have are two sauna rooms:
  one male, one female. The saunas are not tremendously popular but it''s a selling
  point for my gym.


  One of my patrons is a FtM transgender (I''ll call him Jim) and he has started to
  use the saunas. The few of my patrons who use the saunas are not comfortable with
  this because he chooses to use the male sauna. I''ve received three phone calls
  to date (in the span of two months) from male patrons that they''re uncomfortable
  with him using the sauna with them in it. The big thing is Jim goes into the sauna
  topless when he has female anatomy there.


  I decided to speak to Jim about it and decided that he would not be able to use
  the saunas except under these conditions:


  - he can use either sauna when no one is using them

  - he can use the female sauna when topless

  - he can use the male sauna when clothed


  This arrangement seems adequate for all parties involved except Jim, who demands
  open access at any time. Until he can agree to these terms, he can''t use the saunas
  period.


  I don''t know where I stand if I''m being reasonable or if I''m an asshole. One
  customer shouldn''t outweigh another, so I like to think the male patrons who complained
  have more of a voice versus one person, but I want to compromise for everyone.


  edit: if it makes any difference, and it probably doesn''t but I wanted there to
  be more info: members have a tiny swipe card for gym access. The saunas need an
  extra swipe to ensure males don''t go into the female sauna or vice-versa. Jim has
  a male ID, obviously. For now his access has been disabled to both saunas.


  edit2: some might read too far into the thread but I want to say I specifically
  let Jim''s ID be male, allowing him access to the sauna. I knew Jim was FtM transgender.
  He used the male sauna freely until I received complaints. Many posters have the
  idea I''m deciding Jim''s fate when I''m at the mercy of all of my patrons in enacting
  policies which best serve them all. It really boils down to arithmetic at this point:
  if 3 people complain about 1 person, I should do something to ensure the most people
  are happy.


  edit3: see edit2 for overweight men INFO request. If people complained, I''d have
  to talk to them to come to some arrangement that is agreeable by the majority. We
  have a hallway for lockers and 4 single stall nongendered bathrooms with showers
  for changing. Signage says no changing outside of the bathrooms.'
title: AITA for barring use of the sauna for a transgender patron until we can sort
  things out?
