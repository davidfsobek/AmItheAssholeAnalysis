selftext: 'I came up with a really good idea for a business and when I presented it
  to my boyfriend, he was totally on board with it and was just as excited. He talked
  about wanting to be a part of it and investing and what not.


  When we started talking details, I brought up that I wanted to be the owner of the
  company, but he wants to sign onto it and he wants half the revenue. I was kind
  of in shock- if he had an idea for a company, no way would I ever feel entitled
  for him to give me HALF of his company, even if I were to invest.


  I don''t know much about business, but I don''t feel comfortable with giving my
  boyfriend 50%. We have been arguing about it all morning and I don''t think he understands
  that he is my BOYFRIEND, not my husband.


  Anyways, AITA? Am I just being selfish about co-owning a potential business idea?

  EDIT: We haven''t talked about who''s paying for what, but I have already expressed
  that I will be paying for most the costs upfront. I understand that if he invests
  he will have ownership, but 50%?'
