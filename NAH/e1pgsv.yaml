selftext: "So my girlfriend had to have a root canal done today, and was in a bad\
  \ place with it anxiety wise. While I was at work, I was kicked in the eye by a\
  \ student. She had originally asked me to get some things for dinner, which I had\
  \ done, but had to improvise, as the exact items were out of stock. \n\nWhen I got\
  \ home, I immediately started getting the place ready for her to settle in, knowing\
  \ she would be exhausted. After I'd been home 20 minutes, she asked me to run to\
  \ the local convenience store, and get some soup instead. The store didn't have\
  \ what she exactly wanted, so I made a judgement call, and grabbed what I thought\
  \ was the best option. When I got home, she was waiting for me. We exchanged pleasantries,\
  \ and I started trying to get dinner ready. She saw the soup I had bought, and started\
  \ berating me for not getting the kind she asked for, and for doing the same thing\
  \ with the other items. She then also accused me of stealing her thunder with me\
  \ getting kicked in the eye. \n\nI very angrily pointed out that she was being ungrateful,\
  \ but she overrode that because she had a long, terrible day. So, am I the asshole?"
