selftext: "15 year old with history of depression, seeing a therapist, also very submissive\
  \ and I let myself be pressured into literally everything. I cannot say no. (E.G\
  \ working part time for a government office that enraged one side of my family when\
  \ I did it, and if I didn\u2019t would enrage the other, severely stressing me out)\n\
  \nOkay so Ive been working on my depression in therapy, and I finally, finally have\
  \ a dream, a goal, something to keep me going. I saved up from working and my grandparents\
  \ helped me buy a new iPad and Apple Pencil so I could do professional art and make\
  \ a comic. (Just something to keep me going you know?)\nMy parents contributed nothing\
  \ to the cost of the new one, not a problem just putting it out there. Also, it\u2019\
  s both my Christmas and birthday presents for this year.\n\nMy aunt wanted to buy\
  \ my old iPad Air 2 for her eldest daughter, who is moving into primary school year\
  \ 5, for $200Australian. They\u2019re really struggling, her partner has severe\
  \ depression too and has recently lost his job and taken up gambling. Their daughter\
  \ needs the iPad for school, it\u2019s compulsory but when I went through that stage\
  \ in the system we never used ours. She currently has one but it\u2019s not that\
  \ good quality wise.\n\nHere\u2019s the problem. I got the new one, I still had\
  \ the old one, I start to like having the old one as well, it\u2019s useful to have\
  \ two in the art process and in school I just find it easier to take my old one,\
  \ I\u2019m not ready to be mobile with my pristine new iPad. I\u2019ve become more\
  \ and more reluctant to sell it. I finally took a stand for myself and said I didn\u2019\
  t want to.\nI also want to keep it for next year, in which I\u2019ll be in year\
  \ 11 and doing HSCs trials, which are a massive thing here. I like the setup I\u2019\
  ve got going.\n\nNow my aunt is super nice, and didn\u2019t say anything to me directly,\
  \ but obviously spoke to my father (her brother) and must\u2019ve expressed how\
  \ upset it made her (rightfully so her life is extremely difficult atm). And my\
  \ dad came up, made me leave the lounge I was sitting on and said \u201CI really\
  \ don\u2019t see why you need two, I think that was very mean to your Aunt\u201D\
  \nHe knows being called mean is a massive trigger for me and used it deliberately.\
  \ Now I\u2019m unsure of everything again.\n\nI have loads of other cousins and\
  \ family my same age. But it seems I\u2019m the only one these kinds of things are\
  \ expected of. My siblings never have the same pressure, (not in the job field,\
  \ they don\u2019t have to work, not in going places or hanging out with certain\
  \ people I don\u2019t want to be with) and my other cousins are rich and have loads\
  \ of devices at their disposal. (I know one has five, a laptop, phone, old iPad,\
  \ new iPad and a personal gaming console), not here to say they\u2019re obligated\
  \ to do anything just don\u2019t see how it\u2019s fair they\u2019re not asked but\
  \ I am.\n\nSo bringing it back. I\u2019m wallowing in confusion, I\u2019m pretty\
  \ sure I\u2019m the asshole, everyone around me says it. Just need to know for next\
  \ course of action."
