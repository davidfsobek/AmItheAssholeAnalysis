selftext: "My SO is a wonderful person, but suffers from pretty bad anxiety, which\
  \ has only be exasperated by being in his last semester of his Master\u2019s. He\u2019\
  s constantly worried about not being able to find a job, worried about a class he\u2019\
  s taking, and worried about pretty much everything else.\n\nHere\u2019s an example,\
  \ this morning I got some important news about a family member while I was at work.\
  \ I texted him about it and when he responded, instead of responding to what I said,\
  \ he went off on a tangent about school, finding a job, and all of his other anxieties,\
  \ completely ignoring what I said. I\u2019ve found this to be something that happens\
  \ a lot, whenever I have something important to say, it gets pushed down because\
  \ of his own feelings, but that\u2019s a topic for another time.\n\nHe was invited\
  \ to a friends house for Thanksgiving about 7 or so hours from where we live. I\
  \ was originally going to go, but had a change of heart for two reasons. One, we\
  \ have an older cat who I don\u2019t like leaving alone for more than one night\
  \ and is on medication. The other reason I decided I didn\u2019t want to go was\
  \ because of how bad his anxiety has been lately. I\u2019ve felt completely drained\
  \ mentally from everything he dumps on me and just really want a break.\n\nInstead\
  \ of telling him that I needed a mental break, I only told him about not wanting\
  \ to leave our cat. He never takes it well when I tell him things like that and\
  \ I don\u2019t want to make his anxiety any worse than it already is. Part of me\
  \ also just doesn\u2019t want to deal with his reaction. He was extremely disappointed\
  \ that I\u2019m not going with him.\n\nAITA for not telling him the full reason\
  \ why I decided not to go with him?\n\nUpdate: Okay, I talked to my boyfriend yesterday\
  \ before he left and he was very understanding. He didn\u2019t realize how much\
  \ he was dumping on me lately and apologized. He also said he plans to call his\
  \ therapist and see if they can make their appointment in the evening next week\
  \ so I can come. So, progress is being made! Thank you everyone for your words.\
  \ It was a pretty big wake up call. I\u2019m going to make sure we have open communication\
  \ on everything."
