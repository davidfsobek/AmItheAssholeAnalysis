selftext: "As of late, my mother hasn\u2019t been 100% there at all. It is like she\
  \ is a new person and isn\u2019t my \u201Cmother\u201D. This stems back to May,\
  \ where she had all kinds of health problems, but in all honesty she was better\
  \ without me. I\u2019m only 20 years old, and I gave up college for a semester,\
  \ military, and pretty much my whole life to take care of her and now it seems like\
  \ she has a deal with the Devil over my soul. Her family basically encourages her\
  \ bizarre behavior because they often tell her I have to be there for her and she\
  \ ran off with it. \n\nTo stir the pot of this fucked up soup, her behavior is borderline\
  \ toddler like behavior. She refuses to go get groceries unless I go with her, so\
  \ if she has no food, and I\u2019m busy, she will literally starve herself because\
  \ I\u2019m not with her. This is for a lot of her other stuff as well. Last week\
  \ her computer just decided to stop working and I told her to call a tech service,\
  \ because I literally know nothing about computers, and she refused to. Eventually,\
  \ this led to a heated argument and I angrily told her to stop acting like a damn\
  \ child. Usually I try to stay reserved, but it honestly feels like she refuses\
  \ to be an adult sometimes and I feel bad for telling it to her like that but she\
  \ refuses to acknowledge what I say. She doesn\u2019t put gas in her car, go to\
  \ the grocery store, lies about taking her medicine, didn\u2019t follow doctors\
  \ orders, and more. \n\nAITA for telling her off like that?"
