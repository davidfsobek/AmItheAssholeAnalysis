selftext: "At my workplace we organize all social events on a rotating basis and it's\
  \ my turn to plan the office Christmas lunch. It's always a long lunch on a workday,\
  \ often with drinks, paid for by the bosses. \n\nI sent around a poll with a few\
  \ date options and the two most popular options were a Friday (18 yes's) and a Wednesday\
  \ (16 yes's). The people who can't make it all have either work meetings or are\
  \ away on holiday on those dates. The obvious option to me was to book for the Friday,\
  \ which had the most yes's.\n\nSo, there is a part time lady who works Thursdays\
  \ and Fridays only (call her Ann). She is a Jehovah's Witness and they're not allowed\
  \ to celebrate Christmas or birthdays. Usually if we have a celebration on a Thurs\
  \ or Fri we invite her but she doesn't come. One of the other girls in the office\
  \ came up to me and said she didn't think booking the lunch on a Friday was appropriate\
  \ because Ann would be left completely alone at her desk for 3-4 hours while the\
  \ rest of the team went to lunch. It would feel exclusionary. Apparently, when the\
  \ team has had celebrations before like birthdays, it's really awkward because people\
  \ in other teams walk past and see Ann sitting completely alone and she has to explain\
  \ herself a lot. She said that the more considerate option is to book the lunch\
  \ on Wednesday, when Ann would not be here anyway, so she won't be left here alone.\
  \ Every year some people miss out on the Christmas lunch because of work/holidays\
  \ so the two people missing out wouldn't think anything of it.\n\nI said well Ann\
  \ won't come either way but if we book the wednesday 2 people would miss out. I\
  \ can see that it's an awkward situation but we are inviting Ann, it's her choice\
  \ not to come. Surely her comfort isn't more important than 2 other people not getting\
  \ to attend at all?\n\nAITA?"

  though a Jehovah's Witness employee will be left alone at her desk
