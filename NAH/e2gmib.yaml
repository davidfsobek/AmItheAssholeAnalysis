selftext: "My sister is getting married in August 2020. My boyfriend (who is also\
  \ vegan) and I are both invited. My sister reached out to me the day of the proposal\
  \ and asked me to be a bridesmaid, which I was ecstatic about. My sister and I are\
  \ very close, so she said it would be really meaningful to her if I was in the wedding\
  \ party. I\u2019m really excited for her, and I feel great that she values me enough\
  \ to give me a spot. \n\nHer and her fiance have been on top of planning everything\
  \ to avoid stress and pushing things off to the last minute. One of the things they\
  \ already have picked are the venue and catering. I asked my sister about food options\
  \ knowing there will likely only be a couple of dishes we can eat, but she told\
  \ me there won\u2019t be any options for us. Now I\u2019m used to picking from a\
  \ few side dishes, so I wasn\u2019t expecting a lot, but my sister knows I\u2019\
  m vegan and knew it well before she got engaged. Apparently even the vegetables\
  \ are going to be very buttery, so we can\u2019t even eat those. I don\u2019t expect\
  \ a whole vegan friendly wedding, but I\u2019m sure at least one option couldn\u2019\
  t have hurt. \n\nI asked my sister about including at least one thing for me, and\
  \ she just told me I was probably going to have to find something else to bring\
  \ in to eat or that I should eat before the wedding so I won\u2019t be hungry when\
  \ everyone else sits down to eat. Like what? \n\nThis honestly would not be a huge\
  \ deal if I was going to someone else\u2019s wedding who I wasn\u2019t very close\
  \ to, but my sister stressed and emphasized so much about how important it was to\
  \ her that my boyfriend and I be there, then she won\u2019t bother to make sure\
  \ we can actually eat anything then tells me to just bring something else in while\
  \ everyone else is catered to. \n\nI understand it\u2019s her wedding. She has enough\
  \ on her plate already, and I won\u2019t try to make her change the menu for us,\
  \ but we both feel hurt that we\u2019re just being tossed to the side and told to\
  \ fend for our own food.\n\nEdit: A piece of info that I did not include is that\
  \ my parents keep kosher, and they are being provided with options."
