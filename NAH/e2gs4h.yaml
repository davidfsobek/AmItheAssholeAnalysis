selftext: ' My 9 yo daughter is asking me to let her bleach her hair (her natural
  color is a very deep mahogany brown and is ridiculously thick, like enough for 3
  ppl, srsly) so she can dye it parted down the middle, one side pastel purple and
  the other bubble gum pink...she has been hounding me for almost a year and i''m
  ready to break..she has classmates that have done similar styles...she envies hair
  channels on YT...but...i don''t want her to do it...i have ruined my hair with box
  dye....long story short, i had long thick hair as a teen and over the last 15 years,
  my has hair become garbage.. and i don''t want her to start a cycle of chemical
  abuse to her beautiful, thick hair, even if it''s done professionally, Im scared
  she would keep on until her hair is as crap as mine in a few years...so, reddit,
  AITA for telling my daughter no go to a dye job?'
