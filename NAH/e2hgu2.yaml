selftext: 'I recently lost my father. My brother and I are co writing my father''s
  obiturary for our local paper. He wanted to include his long time girlfriend in
  it. I objected and said that I have no problem with his girlfriend. She is a really
  nice person. However, she is not family yet. I thought it was werid to include her.
  If she was married to my brother it would be different, and I would have no objection.
  She was not even that close to my father. This started a huge fight with my brother.
  AITA?


  Edit: My brother and his gf have been together for about 5 years.


  Edit 2: So I''m very humbled by the response this got. I have decided to add my
  brother''s gf on the obiturary. I called my brother and apologized. I still think
  it''s weird but as many of you said it''s not what I want. If it helps my brother
  that''s all that matter. Thanks so much for your perspectives everyone!'
