selftext: "This is my first job. She was technically my first friend, I don't include\
  \ the friendly HR as a friend because. \n\n\n\nUAE working days: Sunday-Thursday\
  \ (weekdays), Friday-Saturday (Weekend for most). Our working days: 7 days a week\
  \ sans scheduled day offs.\n\n\n\nWe have 2 days off each for this week. Coworker\
  \ already got a day off on Saturday last week so she can attend football (soccer)\
  \ play of her kid. I had a continious day off (Tuesday-Wednesday). Coworker asked\
  \ me if I could work on Wednesday instead of her so she can attend her kid's parents\
  \ day thing. I used Church as an excuse and the dentist appointment to say no. I\
  \ know that her home life (unfaithful hubby, stalkers galore etc.)isn't as good\
  \ as mine. But I'm also single so I can't really understand what she's going thru\
  \ first hand. \n\n\nShe was cold to me on the days before my scheduled day off and\
  \ I just wanted to know if I was the asshole for wanting to keep my day offs instead\
  \ of giving it to her? \n\n\nI know its a thing in the work place wherein coworkers\
  \ who are parents have the tendency to push their work to single coworkers because\
  \ its convenient but I know she's not like that and just wanted to bond with her\
  \ kid. \n\n\nI actually did have a dentist appointment (teeth extraction) and was\
  \ grateful to have another day off for rest before stress tomorrow. \n\nTL;DR: Kept\
  \ firm on keeping my days off instead of giving it to a coworker and now wondering\
  \ if I was an asshole for not being an understanding person."
title: AITA for not exchanging my day off with my coworker who I know has family issues
  and really wants to spend time with her kid as much as possible?
