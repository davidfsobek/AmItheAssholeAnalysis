selftext: "Recently my father passed away and I inherited an old revolver that his\
  \ dad gave to him before he passed and its a family heirloom at this point. My wife\
  \ hates guns and the idea of one being in the house with our 14 year old son and\
  \ 16yo daughter and she wants me to sell it.\n\n I understand her worries but I\
  \ am keeping it unloaded in a locked gun safe and this gun is special to me it belonged\
  \ to my father and grandfather and this was the first gun I shot. I also plan to\
  \ teach my children gun safety and how to shoot and my wife is vehemently against\
  \ this as well. So AITA for keeping the gun and WIBTA for teaching my children to\
  \ shoot?\n\nEdit: My children want to learn to shoot and they're really excited\
  \ about it. I know people are saying IWBTA for teaching them but the way I see it\
  \ is they are both already responsible and independent and are old enough to decide\
  \ for themselves.\n\nEdit 2: I've talked to my wife about having it in a safety\
  \ deposit box but she still dosen't like that she wants it sold and wants our family\
  \ to have nothing to do with any firearms. I also talked to her about me going to\
  \ shoot it at a range but she has a problem with that too.\n\nUpdate: I convinced\
  \ her to go shooting with me this weekend just me and her. I'll teach her firearm\
  \ safety and start her off shooting my brother's .22. She says she understands why\
  \ I want to keep it and she is just scared of one of us getting hurt. Hopefully\
  \ taking her to shoot will help her with her fear."
