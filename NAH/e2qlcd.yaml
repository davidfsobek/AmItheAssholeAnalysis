selftext: "My husband (of 11 years) and I work the same hours, but he has a 5 min\
  \ commute and I have an hour commute.  We have 2 kids, but honestly this was issue\
  \ before we had them.  When we get off of work one of us calls the other immediately\
  \ we have a 5-10 min conversation catching up on the day and who is picking up which\
  \ of our kids and maybe what\u2019s for dinner.  Normally he gets our oldest heads\
  \ home does a little light cleaning or relaxes while I am driving home.  I normally\
  \ pick up our younger kid and when I get home I cook dinner, set the table, straighten\
  \ the kitchen and clean as much as I can when cooking.  I don\u2019t like talking\
  \ to anyone when I am home for the first 30-40min.  I am cooking/cleaning listening\
  \ to music in my head phones.  I like cooking and pick slightly more elaborate menus\
  \ even on the weeknight, chopping, peeling, etc is how I unwind after a long day.\
  \  I don\u2019t think this is too much to ask, especially since I am preparing food\
  \ for the family.  Despite discussing this multiple times how much I need some quiet\
  \ time my husband fairly regularly bombards me when I walk in the door.  He wants\
  \ to talk about current events, weekend plans, friend gossip, his job, etc.  When\
  \ I cut him off and ask for space and to get out of the kitchen he is super hurt.\
  \  Our kitchen isn\u2019t huge so part of it is a logistics thing where I need to\
  \ be able to move freely.  I don\u2019t like hurting him, but it is so overwhelming\
  \ at the end of a long day to me.  I think some issues are he already has \u201C\
  me\u201D time before I get home.  I guess my commute is me time but is in congested\
  \ stop and go traffic and not relaxing.  Also he works alone in a lab and has no\
  \ human contact all day where I manage people who tend to make me bananas on top\
  \ of fielding customers all day so I think he excited to talk to another adult where\
  \ I just want quiet.  I also feel like all super important info can be communicated\
  \ during are brief after work phone call and catch up stuff can wait till we are\
  \ sitting down to dinner or after dinner.  So AITA?"
