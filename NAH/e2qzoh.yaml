  \ who is rude a good bit of the time she comes through my line.  Well, today she\
  \ came through my line talking about how nervous she is about hosting thanksgiving\
  \ for her family for the first time ever & hopes nothing goes wrong. She says this\
  \ as she puts a frozen turkey on the belt. Given her history of being rude to me,\
  \ AITA for not telling her she should buy a fresh turkey because a frozen one won\u2019\
  t thaw by tomorrow?"
