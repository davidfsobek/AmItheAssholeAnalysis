selftext: "I\u2019m a 40ish year old woman, and my immediate family (parents + 2 siblings)\
  \ have all passed away.  Because holidays are hard for me, 5-6 years ago I started\
  \ doing a \u201CFriendsgiving\u201D at my house.  Super informal \u2014 I cook and\
  \ people come and go as they please.  Some stay the entire time and some drop in\
  \ as they travel.  It\u2019s a ton of fun, and makes a shitty holiday better.\n\n\
  This year, a new friend decided to do a meal at her place too.  However, she invited\
  \ everyone the 1st day of November, before I\u2019d even thought about it.  Hers\
  \ was formal, requesting RSVPs for seating. It irked me a little (this is MY thing),\
  \ I know I was being irrational.  As many people can have Thanksgivings as they\
  \ want, right?  So I sent out my invite a couple of weeks ago and got back notes\
  \ that people be there, but would leave early to go to the other meal.\n\nLater,\
  \ I jokingly asked my best friend, Claire, if she\u2019d be joining me for Thanksgiving.\
  \  Claire\u2019s family usually does a vacation/meal and so she\u2019s NEVER available.\
  \  That\u2019s never been an issue.  I don\u2019t expect anyone to skip a meal with\
  \ their family to come to my thing.  Claire shocked me by letting me know that she\
  \ was going to other meal, ONLY there.\n\nClaire and I have been incredibly close.\
  \  Over the past 2 years she left an abusive partner and I was on speed dial for\
  \ her the entire time.  She had a failed pregnancy and had an abortion \u2014 I\
  \ went with her to the appointment and took care of her afterward.  He gave her\
  \ an STD \u2014 I went with her to the doctor.  Other friends gave up because she\
  \ kept going back but I was always saying \u201CHey it\u2019s hard to leave an abusive\
  \ asshole.\u201D  She was the maid of honor in my wedding and was there for me when\
  \ my sister was killed in a car accident.  She has listened to me cry over not having\
  \ a \u201Creal\u201D family through many holidays, and knows how important it has\
  \ become to me that I am \u201Cmaking\u201D a family group for myself.  \n\nI was\
  \ really upset that she decided to go to this other meal.  So I used my words, and\
  \ she basically told me that they\u2019d asked first.  I understood that, but didn\u2019\
  t understand why she didn\u2019t take 15 seconds to text me and at least check and\
  \ see with me.  She told me she didn\u2019t think she had to do that, and that I\
  \ was really reaching for reasons to be mad.  For her it\u2019s just a meal, but\
  \ to me its important and she either forgot that or didn\u2019t care enough to check.\n\
  \nI was already bummed that nobody would be able to stay the entire time due to\
  \ this other meal, but with my \u201Csister\u201D skipping, I really lost any desire\
  \ to cook an elaborate meal.  I decided to cancel early this week.  Most of friends\
  \ were fine, but one person asked what was was up and I explained, and they told\
  \ me I was being really dramatic to cancel so close to the day because a single\
  \ person wouldn\u2019t come.  Now I feel guilty and like I threw a childish tantrum.\
  \  AITA for cancelling my Friendsgiving?  Should I just have sucked it up this year\
  \ and send out my invitations in July next year?"
