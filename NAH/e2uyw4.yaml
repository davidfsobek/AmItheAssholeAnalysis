selftext: "Let me start by saying I am completely ignorant about autism, so I apologize\
  \ in advance.\n\nSO, I work in retail and a mom came in with her son who's about\
  \ my age for some shoes. \nI believe he's mid-high functioning. He was verbal, but\
  \ I could tell he had a developmental disorder. He's 18 and I'm 19. Both born in\
  \ 2000 and he told me a bunch of interesting things that happened the year we were\
  \ born. His mom kept telling him to stop, but I didn't mind. \n\nI got a long really\
  \ well with him. He kept going on about his Halloween costume and when his mom basically\
  \ told him to chill, I told them not to worry. I told them I was interested in what\
  \ he had to say, id laugh and ask questions. His mom kept saying I was the sweetest\
  \ thing ever, but it wasn't trouble. He was very into sneakers and so am I, so I\
  \ didn't mind that either. But when he was telling me in detail about every shoe\
  \ he had (so many), it was clear he was on the spectrum.\n\n\nI saw them again last\
  \ week. \nThe mom was explaining how shopping in a huge mall is always difficult\
  \ for him because of sensory issues but he was so excited to come to the mall again\
  \ for a chance to speak with me again. The mom didn't want to be creepy so they\
  \ waited until they had a legitimate reason to come in. While he was looming at\
  \ shoes, \nShe kept talking about how I was so great with him, and how he gets annoyed\
  \ by everybody but me. She mentioned payment.\n\nI won't say but it's a lot per\
  \ hour. She says that either her or her husband would always be there in the house\
  \ or wherever we go. Once were all more comfortable, her son and I could hang out\
  \ alone (on campus or something, were both commuter students)\n\nI feel like taking\
  \ the money is wrong, but I'm telling myself it's no more than babysitting. But\
  \ I KNOW I'm not really \"babysitting\" if his parents are there. He also doesn't\
  \ need a babysitter because she says that he stays home alone all the time, which\
  \ is one of the reasons she wants me to work with them. \n\nShe also mentioned that\
  \ he wouldn't know I'm being paid.\n\nThe worst part is this...i don't think I'd\
  \ do it for free. It's just that it's hard enough for me to make time to see the\
  \ friends I already have. \n\nSO WIBTA\n\nEdit: seeing another post here from the\
  \ perspective of a parent in a similar situation really had me thinking"
