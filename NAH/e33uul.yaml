selftext: "So, this happened mostly yesterday and I'm just trying to get a feeling\
  \ for where I stand. So I've been married to my wife D for 2 years now, we are in\
  \ our early 30s, in pretty decent shape and I think we are both pretty good looking.\
  \ Not knockout gorgeous, but good looking. Lately due to work and holiday stress\
  \ we've not been having sex for about a month and a half. I'm fine with this, it's\
  \ not usually a problem and it's just busy right now. We are happily married and\
  \ have no ongoing issues. \n\nSo, two days ago, at work one of my co-workers whom\
  \ I good friends with, H, was dressed up pretty nicely. She said she was going to\
  \ a nice party after work and that's why she dressed up. Pretty woman, but not generally\
  \ my type, very friendly though, but yesterday she was looking very good. After\
  \ work though I didn't give it any more though and spent time with my wife watching\
  \ movies. \n\nThat night we went straight to bed again, tired. However I ended up\
  \ having a pretty vivid sex dream about H. It was surprisingly hot. I woke up with\
  \ a pretty strong erection, which my wife noticed. She teased me about it and I\
  \ admitted it was from a sex dream (not a wet one) and she didn't ask who it was\
  \ and I decided not to mention it. I figured either it would bother her or not matter\
  \ and there was no point. Either way, she was surprisingly turned in by it. So she\
  \ climbed on top and we had some really good lovemaking. So good in fact I was late\
  \ meeting up with a close friend for breakfast. \n\nSo, I was bragging a little\
  \ to my buddy (my wife knows him and knows we talk about this stuff, we've known\
  \ him for years) about that morning. He gave me some shit about the dream and I\
  \ said \"Funny thing was, it wasn't even D, but someone else I know\" and he got\
  \ really serious. He asked if she knew that, I told him no and he said it wasn't\
  \ right of me to be dreaming about other women and lying about it. I argued back\
  \ that I can't control my dreams and had no intention of making it a reality, nor\
  \ did I see a point in telling D it wasn't her. He said I was an AH and hasn't really\
  \ talked to me since. \n\nSo, AITA?\n\nEDIT TO ADD: Two things, one, this friend\
  \ of ours is regularly over and we discuss things like sex lives pretty openly.\
  \ More than once my wife has told him to get lost so we could get busy and things\
  \ like that. She knows we discuss this stuff, it's not a problem for anyone. Two,\
  \ I honestly don't think she would have cared, she's pretty laid back, I just didn't\
  \ see a point in going out of my way to tell her it was someone else. If she asked,\
  \ I'd have definitely told her, and I'm 95% sure she would just tease me about it,\
  \ but there was a 5% chance she would be unhappy about it and I just didn't want\
  \ to risk it.\n\nEDIT 2: So.. he texted her. She's pretty annoyed... at him. Her\
  \ exact words to me were \"does he think I was born yesterday? you'd have described\
  \ the dream if it was me, it obviously wasn't and that's fine\". So she figured\
  \ it out pretty much on her own anyway. She asked him to not treat her like she\
  \ can't take care of herself. I asked her if she wanted me to have handled it differently\
  \ and she said no, it's fine, and I asked if she cared that I told him and she said\
  \ no, she tells his girlfriend the same sort of stuff (which I knew) and we're all\
  \ good now."

  about her?
