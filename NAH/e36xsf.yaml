selftext: I have two sons, who are 6 and 3. We recently donated a lot of their old
  toys that they no longer play with. The break from the toy clutter was so refreshing
  for us as parents. Although my kids were sad initially that we got rid of a lot
  of their toys, they too found the lack of clutter refreshing (because it's more
  room for them to roughhouse and run around probably). This Christmas, I think that
  it will be better if we give our sons a max of 3 materialistic presents (those will
  be from Santa) and get them an experience gift as well (a year long pass to the
  planetarium), which will be from us. However, in past Christmases, they have easily
  gotten at least 8-10 presents each (not including presents from friends and extended
  family). I don't want to disappoint them on Christmas morning when they see less
  presents under the tree, but I don't want to give them more presents that will just
  be crammed into the toy box after 10 minutes. Am I right or wrong here?
