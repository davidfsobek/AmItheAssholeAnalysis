selftext: "Full disclosure: this is a throw away account for anonymity.\n\nI gave\
  \ birth 3 months ago to my daughter. My sister in law brought a gift over to the\
  \ house, it was a sign with the saying: \n\nTwinkle twinkle little star, do you\
  \ know how loved you are?\n\nThis was very thoughtful, but then she went on to explain\
  \ that it was from our nieces nursery. Our niece (her daughter) had devastatingly\
  \ passed away just hours after she was born (3 years ago.)\n\nAfter finding out\
  \ that the sign once hung in a different nursery for our niece who had passed, it\
  \ made me feel a little differently about hanging it in my daughters nursery, I\
  \ don\u2019t know why, it just did. I really in my heart just did not feel right\
  \ hanging it up... so I tucked it away in a drawer that evening. \n\nFast forward\
  \ present day, sister in law visits again. Notices the sign is not in the nursery,\
  \ which totally threw me off. I had forgotten about it. She then asked me and my\
  \ husband where the sign was and I said as nicely as I could that we had just decided\
  \ not to hang it up. I didn\u2019t know what else to say, and I didn\u2019t know\
  \ how to explain why I didn\u2019t hang it up. I couldn\u2019t, and still can\u2019\
  t explain my feelings about it. She then got very angry with us and demanded the\
  \ sign back and left without another word. \n\nAITA for not putting that sign up?"
