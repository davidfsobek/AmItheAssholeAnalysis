  \ of  our street was plowed. It wasn't her side. Our neighbor keeps parking on \
  \ the curb outside our house because her side of the street isn't plowed.  She says\
  \ there's black ice underneath the snow and she can't get her  car out. She's interfering\
  \ with my family being able to park outside our  house.\n\nWell, yeah, we shoveled\
  \ our snow for the same reason. My wife left a note on her car explaining how disrespectful\
  \ this is.  \nAITA? NTA?"

  her own! We shoveled our roads for a reason, and it wasn't for her to park there!
