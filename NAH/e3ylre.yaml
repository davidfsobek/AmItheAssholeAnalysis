selftext: "WeThis should read, are we the assholes, but that's not how this site goes\
  \ grammatically. Names are fake. We had a beautiful, healthy child (Emma). A year\
  \ later, I got pregnant again. We were on the fence about having another child.\
  \ We would barely stay afloat financially with two kids, and Emma was so young.\
  \ We got all the testing we reasonably could. Sadly, we were shocked by Down's syndrome.\
  \ \n\nWe had a decision to make. We had no idea how severe it could be. We couldn't\
  \ bear a forever child. We couldn't afford therapies and equipment. We aren't ignorant\
  \ about the emotional, mental, and time costs of keeping such a delayed child. My\
  \ own sister, who is deceased now, made sure I grew up arguably neglected. My husband's\
  \ cousin, who has very severe disabilities, tormented him as a child with all the\
  \ adults defending that he \"didn't know better\". Keeping this second child would\
  \ cost Emma her childhood. So, we gave him up in the hospital.\n\nWe told our families\
  \ that we had a stillbirth, and I destroyed all outward evidence that I'd had another\
  \ pregnancy so there would be fewer questions. My husband got a vasectomy, and I\
  \ got my tubes removed. Nothing from us is going to tarnish Emma.\n\nI've looked\
  \ into the matter years on and I am very sure I know who got him. He's not as severe\
  \ as he could be, but he will be a forever child and our household is not suitable\
  \ for him. We're one and done, and our Emma is happy and thriving, something she\
  \ could never have with a \"sibling\". I've since told a very close friend, and\
  \ she thinks Emma will think it's a severe case of favouritism and hate us when\
  \ she's older, but I can't imagine that. AITA?"
