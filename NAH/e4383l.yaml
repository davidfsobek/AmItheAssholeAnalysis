selftext: "My dad passed four days ago. I have been back to my mom's, 4 hours away,\
  \ to help her make arrangements and generally cope. Now back home, I sat down at\
  \ the basement computer to start writing a remembrance of my dad and work through\
  \ my grief. I texted my wife upstairs and this is the conversation that transpired:\n\
  \n \n\n**Me:**\n\nfucking hell. I started trying to write a remembrance and now\
  \ I have to stop because I can\u2019t pay K when I\u2019m wrecked\n\n**Her:**\n\n\
  Are you writing just for yourself or for the memorial?\n\nMe:\n\nBoth. \n\nMom has\
  \ someone who can deliver our pieces at the memorial\n\n**Her:**\n\nSomeone else\
  \ will read them?\n\n**Me:**\n\nOh yeah. I can\u2019t imagine reading aloud at it\
  \ right now\n\nMom\u2019s got someone at (redacted) with a good speaking voice who\
  \ can deliver all our stuff, if I recall her correctly\n\n**Her:**\n\nWhatever you\
  \ all want is what you should do. But if I die before you, you\u2019d better say\
  \ some nice shit about me in your own damn voice. \n\n**Me:**\n\nAre you seriously\
  \ already giving me shit about the manner in which I may someday grieve you if you\
  \ predecease me? What the actual fuck.\n\n**Her:**\n\nOh Jesus. No...it was meant\
  \ to be light-hearted. That isn\u2019t the way I talk and you know it. \n\n**Me:**\n\
  \nLook I am feeling pretty raw right now please don\u2019t fuck with me like this"
