selftext: "We have an 11 year old daughter, Molly, who is incredibly bright and smart.\
  \ She's skipped two grades and is very reserved and mature for her age, and has\
  \ trouble making friends. We thought she might have Autism but after testing she\
  \ does not, she's just a reserved child. We absolutely adore Molly and want the\
  \ best for her.\n\nThe problem is, Molly knows everything. Well, she thinks she\
  \ knows everything. She's going through that stage where all kids think they know\
  \ better than others, even adults. She has three younger siblings, ages 9, 7, and\
  \ 4, and we live in the same neighborhood as my brother and my wife's brother, who\
  \ each have three kids each. Our neighborhood has several children all in the same\
  \ age group and most of them attend the same school.\n\nNo one wants to hang out\
  \ with Molly because she's becoming very pedantic and very controlling about everything.\
  \ For example, she and her cousins and three neighborhood kids were playing some\
  \ game that involved a ball, I'm not sure. Apparently they play in gym at school\
  \ and they all know the rules involved. But everyone knows kids especially will\
  \ sometimes agree to forget certain rules if they're unnecessary or they just don't\
  \ like that rule. Molly will halt the game and lecture everyone on the proper way\
  \ to play the game. Then she usually stops playing and starts acting like a coach\
  \ or a teacher, supervising and lecturing further.\n\nAnother example: our 9 year\
  \ old and 7 year old were playing with the 9 year old's dolls and they were waging\
  \ an incredible (fake) battle that involved magic and impossible stunts. I thought\
  \ it was cute. Molly interrupted their game to explain to them why \\[this\\], \\\
  [this\\], and \\[this\\] were not possible. 9 and 7 didn't want to continue playing\
  \ because of it.\n\nAnother ex: the other night my wife and I were talking about\
  \ a TV show our 4 year old enjoys. Our neighbor has a toddler and he was curious\
  \ if the show was something toddler would like. I gave him the basic rundown of\
  \ the show. Molly was doing her homework at the table and overheard, came in and\
  \ corrected me. It's not that she corrected me, I'm fine with that, it's her attitude,\
  \ \"well, actually, \\[person\\], that's not correct and you know it\".  She's starting\
  \ to notice that no wants to play with her and she's been asking why. My wife and\
  \ I sat down with her in private and explained to her that we know she's very smart\
  \ and bright but her attitude is coming across as pretentious and overbearing and\
  \ its making it hard for others to enjoy being around her. We stressed how much\
  \ we love her and all we want is for her to be happy and make friends. She asked\
  \ us to leave her room and we heard her crying for most of the evening. \n\nWere\
  \ we assholes?"
