selftext: "I was on a 14 hour flight home, sitting middle row left aisle seat. This\
  \ woman and man (either a couple or friends) are in the two middle seats of the\
  \ row, woman sitting next to me. During the flight, she takes over the right armrest\
  \ (there\u2019s okay. I believe people in middle seats can take the armrest). She\
  \ falls asleep and starts leaning over waaaaay\u201D over to my space (left of the\
  \ armrest, so definitely in my space). No problem, people fall asleep and get in\
  \ neighbors space accidentally. I nudge her gently, she wakes up, and goes back\
  \ to her space. \n\nProblem is she does this repeatedly a few more times on the\
  \ flight. Falling asleep and leaning over in my space. I nudged her one more time\
  \ to wake her, gently said heyyy you keep falling asleep over to my side., which\
  \ she then goes back to her space. \n\nThen a while later, back again. If it was\
  \ a short flight that\u2019s fine. But it\u2019s an international flight and I would\
  \ like my space. I\u2019m also wondering why she doesn\u2019t sleep to her friend\
  \ or bf\u2019s side. \n\nI decide to turn on my seat\u2019s airplane light (intensely\
  \ bright) which for some reason seems to cast a more annoying brightness to her\
  \ direction than mine. This eventually wakes her up because it\u2019s so bright.\
  \ She eventually settles back into her space. I turn off my light. \n\nAnd...she\u2019\
  s in my space again. Lordy. I turn my light back on. She wakes up, she asks if it\u2019\
  s my light and i said yes. It seems she tries to fall back asleep but can\u2019\
  t due to the light. \n\nEventually she asks if i can turn off my light and I said\
  \ no. I no longer have space issues for the rest of the flight. It seems she didn\u2019\
  t have eye mask.\n\nShe eventually sleeps but she\u2019s learned to turn and lean\
  \ on her friend\u2019s side to avoid the light. \n\nAITA for causing this annoying\
  \ discomfort to get her to stop falling asleep on my side?"
