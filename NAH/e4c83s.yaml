selftext: "So my boyfriend(now fianc\xE9) and I have been together for 5 years. He\u2019\
  s great, and I love him. We had discussed getting married before a little bit and\
  \ both said we wanted to, but didn\u2019t really say when. \n\nBoth our families\
  \ were away for thanksgiving so we decided to take a little vacation, we went to\
  \ sequoia national park and I thought that it would be the perfect place to propose.\
  \ I already bought him a really nice watch (he wears one but it\u2019s sort of cheap),\
  \ and when we were in this beautiful little clearing with the huge trees and no\
  \ one was around I popped the question, got down on one knee and all.\n\nHe was\
  \ really surprised and didn\u2019t exactly react the way I expected, he seemed sort\
  \ of annoyed and upset but eventually said yes. On the drive home he said that it\
  \ made him upset that I would just propose and that it was \u201Ca mans part of\
  \ a marriage\u201D and \u201Csomething he was looking forward to his whole life\u201D\
  . So now I feel really awful because I thought it would be really sweet if we reversed\
  \ the roles because he\u2019s always doing romantic things for me.\n\nAnyway he\
  \ was sort of cold when we got home, not outwardly aggressive but now I\u2019m just\
  \ sitting here worried if I did something horribly wrong.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: Jesus\
  \ I didn\u2019t expect this many comments. I see a bunch of people talking about\
  \ how he lost his chance when he waited 5 years, but I\u2019m only 27 and he\u2019\
  s 28, so we were in college and grad school for much of the relationship. He was\
  \ getting his PhD and was busy and I got my masters and started my job and he was\
  \ still in school. We had this conversation maybe 4 months ago? So it\u2019s not\
  \ like he\u2019s had years.\n\nI\u2019m planning on talking to him about it when\
  \ he wakes up. But I don\u2019t really appreciate the \u201Cyour marriage is doomed\u201D\
  \ comments\n\nUpdate: I figured I\u2019d update since some of the comments were\
  \ actually very helpful, despite a few suspect pms. I talked to him earlier, and\
  \ he apologized for getting upset, I apologized for making him upset and we made\
  \ up, and then he pulled out an engagement ring for me and proposed back. So all\
  \ is well, and I still feel a little bad for stealing his  thunder, but these things\
  \ happen I suppose. But I\u2019m getting married!"
