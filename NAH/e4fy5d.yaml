selftext: 'AITA: A few weeks ago my mother was diagnosed with cancer. Unfortunately,
  this cancer cannot be cured and she has been given a maximum life span of 1 to 2
  years. We do many things together, call each other almost every day and, for example,
  will soon go on vacation to Cape Verde.


  Now her husband just called me to see if they could come by while walking. I said
  no to this, I drank a lot of beer and shots yesterday / tonight, so I don''t feel
  fit. Am I now the asshole because I said no while my mother and her husband wanted
  to come by while I am sitting at home with a hangover?'
