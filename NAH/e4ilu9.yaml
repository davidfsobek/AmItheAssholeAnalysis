selftext: "Weird title and weird situation. \n\nBasically, I have food allergies.\
  \ I am a sophomore at college and last year I had an allergic reaction that caused\
  \ me to be hospitalized after kissing my ex. It was my fault because I didn't ask\
  \ first. I honestly didn't think this was as big of a risk as my doctor made it\
  \ seem. I thought it was one of those things doctors tell you to scare you into\
  \ being overly cautious but once I ended up in the hospital I realized that I need\
  \ to take this more seriously. My ex ended up breaking things off because she said\
  \ she didn't want to risk another reaction but didn't want to change her whole diet\
  \ around since I have a few serious allergies. \n\nNow I make sure to ask girls\
  \ before I kiss them. I started dating my girlfriend about a month ago and every\
  \ time she comes over I ask her to list the things she has eaten that day. My doctor\
  \ recommended not kissing until it's been at least 4 hours since the other person\
  \ has consumed the allergen and having them brush their teeth. My girlfriend has\
  \ started saying, \"Don't worry, I didn't eat anything bad\" but I know there are\
  \ some things that people don't realize contain my allergens. I once had a reaction\
  \ after eating chilli because I didn't realize it contained peanuts. So I ask for\
  \ specific foods and times when they were consumed. My girlfriend thinks I don't\
  \ trust her and wants me to stop asking. \n\nAITA?"
title: AITA for asking my girlfriend to run down the list of things she has eaten
  and ask her to brush her teeth before we kiss?
