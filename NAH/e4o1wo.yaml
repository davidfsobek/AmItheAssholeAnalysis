selftext: "My wife\u2019s birthday is in a month and she really wants an Apple Watch\
  \ but because our money is tight, she\u2019s keen to look at second hand options.\
  \ \n\nI have had one for around a year, which I don\u2019t love and would prefer\
  \ another brand (a Garmin). It makes sense to then give her my Apple Watch but I\u2019\
  m conflicted because I know her birthday present is becoming about what I want.\
  \ I feel like an a**hole!\n\nNote I would also get her a few other smaller, funny\
  \ and thoughtful gifts but the watch would be the main present."
