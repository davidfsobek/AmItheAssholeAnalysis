selftext: "Situation:- Married for 20+ years not a great marriage, but not terrible\
  \ either we have two amazing kids one 18 the other\_ 17. We live in a very quite,\
  \ and economically depressed regional town.\_\n\nRecently I have felt that my job\
  \ going nowhere and have had itchy feet to try something new and extend myself.\_\
  \n\nI have a very specific skill set which would make getting a new job in the local\
  \ area impossible. Jobs needing my skills don't really exist here. Even the largest\
  \ nearby city has limited opportunities, though I have applied for what jobs there\_\
  \ are there.\_\n\nOn the other hand I have been offered my dream job in a state\
  \ 1000 miles away.\_\n\nMy children are in the final years of school and don't want\
  \ to move immediately. I respect that and told them I won't force them to move,\
  \ but I also don't want them to feel I am abandoning them\n\nBoth have also said\
  \ that they want me to be happy and they can see that moving to a big city once\
  \ their education is done will give them more opportunities in the future.\_\n\n\
  Both have recognised that their futures at some point will require them to leave\
  \ this area. I feel like by taking this job I can offer them a launching pad for\
  \ when they are ready.\_\n\nMy wife has been blunt about not wanting to move. Ever.\
  \ Period. She is stable and comfortable and resents me for even bringing up the\
  \ idea. She has accused me of being unkind, selfish and a bit of an arsehole. If\
  \ I take the job it will probably be the end of my marriage.\_\n\nSo reddit AITA,\
  \ for wanting to fuck off from this desolate town in hope of a better life for myself\
  \ and my kids?\_"
