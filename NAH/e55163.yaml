selftext: "I have three kids, two in their twenties and one teenager. My oldest daughter\
  \ lives with her partner and my younger two live with me.\n\nMy ex and I recently\
  \ divorced and I could no longer afford the house we had been living in, so I sold\
  \ it and bought a three bedroom condo. One room is for me, one for my son and one\
  \ for my younger daughter. I didn\u2019t get a four bedroom because my older daughter\
  \ doesn\u2019t live here and it didn\u2019t make financial sense, but I did buy\
  \ a large couch for when she stays over. It\u2019s very comfortable and roomy enough\
  \ for both her and her fianc\xE9.\n\nOD visited for Thanksgiving, and on her first\
  \ night here she and my son had a fight. I was asleep so don\u2019t know the details\
  \ but it ended with her leaving the house and calling her father to pick her up\
  \ as she had been drinking. In the morning I met up with her and tried to figure\
  \ out what happened. She wouldn\u2019t talk about it but said she wouldn\u2019t\
  \ be staying over. I told her that I want her here for the holidays and this is\
  \ her home too, and she told me that it isn\u2019t her home because she doesn\u2019\
  t have her own room and has to sleep on the couch.\n\nI personally do not see why\
  \ she needs her own room when she does not live here, but she is insisting that\
  \ she does not want to visit for Christmas and will not be staying in my house."
