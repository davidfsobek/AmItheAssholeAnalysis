selftext: "We have two dogs who are 15 and likely suffering from canine dementia.\
  \ They have to be in doggie diapers 24/7 and also have vomit and poop accidents\
  \ a few times a month.  This has been going on for about a year and is really only\
  \ getting worse. \n\nThe issue is my husband adores these dogs, and absolutely doesn\u2019\
  t want to euthanize. We actually even recently took one in for surgery (at a cost\
  \ of $3500!) to attempt to fix the problem. It didn\u2019t. They don\u2019t have\
  \ any specific medical reason for the loss of bladder control, they still want to\
  \ drink/eat, and I guess they enjoy their life as much as any elderly dog does.\
  \ They mostly sleep and that\u2019s about it.  He thinks they\u2019re not suffering.\
  \  I guess it depends on your definition of suffering. They are definitely confused,\
  \ and also mostly deaf and blind. He said he would euthanize if it was a situation\
  \ like terminal cancer, but I feel like he\u2019s not considering the mental suffering/confusion\
  \ that they are likely going through if they\u2019ve even forgotten the most basic\
  \ skills like going to the bathroom outside. \n\nMy husband typically works 12-14\
  \ hour days (EDIT: 5 days a week) and also travels frequently. So the lion\u2019\
  s share of this responsibility falls on me. We also have young children, one of\
  \ whom is still in diapers herself. So it\u2019s a lot of work and honestly kind\
  \ of overwhelming. The dogs usually go through about 15 wet diapers a day, and of\
  \ course even the dry diapers have to be removed and put back on every time they\
  \ want to go outside- which is constantly. The cost isn\u2019t a huge factor but\
  \ the monthly dog diaper budget is also around $250. \n\nI love the dogs too and\
  \ I would of course be very sad to put them down, but I feel like the time has come.\
  \ I\u2019m overwhelmed with changing literally hundreds of dog diapers every month\
  \ and I also think the dogs\u2019 quality of life these days is rather poor. Am\
  \ I the asshole if I basically insist to my husband that we have to euthanize?"
