selftext: "So 2 years ago I was with this one girl for awhile things were great at\
  \ first but eventually it started going downhill (she had trust issues, ptsd, and\
  \ some other things) I really enjoyed being with her but when she got pregnant neither\
  \ of us had a set career going, no house, still only 20 years old and I was getting\
  \ ready to leave for the Army. Now towards the end of our relationship she got pregnant\
  \ and I was waiting for the right time to breakup with her. When she told me that\
  \ she was pregnant I told her that we can\u2019t have a kid at this age and I no\
  \ longer wanted to be with her since I was leaving in a month I was very firm towards\
  \ her getting an abortion but she insisted that she keeps it but I knew this is\
  \ a bad idea so the next day I sent a text explaining to her that if she keeps the\
  \ baby I still don\u2019t want to be with her anymore, but I would still support\
  \ the kid. For a couple of weeks she wouldn\u2019t leave me alone and trying to\
  \ talk with me but I didn\u2019t want to (it was a bad breakup for her) eventually\
  \ she said she had the abortion a month after we broke up I also have a picture\
  \ of paperwork showing she had the abortion I have no idea what happened to her\
  \ but I feel like an asshole for the way I handled that situation. Anyways I hope\
  \ that all makes sense if not feel free to ask and thanks for your opinions."
