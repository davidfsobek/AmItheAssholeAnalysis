selftext: "My (27) boyfriend (29) of two years wants to move in together at the start\
  \ of next year. I agreed but stipulated from the very first conversation we had\
  \ that we should work together to put a plan in place for how we handle it if we\
  \ break up. \n\nWill we continue to live together until the lease is up? Or who\
  \ would keep the apartment and who would move out? How long will the person who\
  \ moves be given to find a new place? Would the other person find another place\
  \ to crash during this period? Or would both of us move out so we could split the\
  \ security deposit?\n\nAll of these questions seem very pragmatic to me and I don't\
  \ think it is hurtful to imagine a scenario where we break up. I'm not saying we\
  \ will necessarily. Just that it's a possiblity we should plan for. \n\nI've known\
  \ people who end up having to move back in with their parents because they broke\
  \ up with their significant others, are forced to move out immediately, and they\
  \ don't have the money on hand for a new place. Agreeing on a set adjustment period\
  \ now just seems smart.\n\nWell. He's upset. He claims I'm secretly plotting our\
  \ break up, that in asking these questions, I am saying that I don't trust him,\
  \ and that I am afraid of commitment. I claim that having these conversations is\
  \ a sign of maturity and good sense.\n\nAITA?"
