selftext: "My girlfriends birthday is 10 days before mine so im usually first to give\
  \ gifts. I love her to death but she is the worst gift giver i have ever known.\
  \ This is probably because she gives gifts that make her feel good. Last year i\
  \ took us both to disney for her birthday and my birthday present was a rope bracelet\
  \ with her name in little cubes. Most people thought i had a daughter who gifted\
  \ it to me. Anyways this year i gave her a movado bold evolution watch. She had\
  \ been hinting at it all year and at one point even sent her wishlist to me lol.\
  \ Anyways we had agreed to just get each other a perfect gift which they would love,\
  \ when my birthday rolled around i got a jar filled with 10 notes. Every note said\
  \ a thing she loves about me. She told me to open one every day and send her my\
  \ reaction. I faked being happy because i want her to feel happy but all of my friends\
  \ are now telling me that shes a golddigger and honestly. Im kinda sad that i didn\u2019\
  t get a present i would like in return. She asked me multiple times what i wanted\
  \ and all i said was that i wanted a new book or a nice record. I appreciate the\
  \ gesture but everyone i know keeps telling me i spend too much money."
