selftext: 'I''m an English professor at a university I wouldn''t dare to name. I''m
  34, if that matters. My student is 21. She has already taken two of my seminars,
  and is currently taking her third. The current seminar is all about sonnets. My
  student is really invested in the subject matter of my courses. She has always written
  more than the expected amount. She goes above and beyond to research the topics
  being discussed.


  Last year, she stayed after class for the first time to discuss Jane Austen, as
  my last seminar addressed Austen''s works. As it was around noon, I asked her if
  she would join me for lunch. I had no malintent - I was hungry and wanted to continue
  the conversation over a hot meal. This eventually spiraled into a weekly event.


  I happened to mention our meetings to a female colleague recently, who was surprised
  and called it "creepy." Should I keep this to myself? Should I put an end to it?
  Our conversations rarely stray from the seminar subjects. The sketchiest moment
  was when she told me I had received a "pepper" on Rate My Professor, but I had quickly
  changed the subject.


  AITA?'
