selftext: "I (16F) often do the grocery shopping for the family. My parents want me\
  \ to do this to give me responsibility and exercise. My mom gives me a shopping\
  \ list and cash. She usually gives me a little more cash than necessary and lets\
  \ me keep the rest. She never explained anything about buying things that are not\
  \ on the list. She frequently encourages me to study hard and save money so I can\
  \ be able to move out and be self-sufficient when I turn 18 unlike my older brother.\
  \ I save most of the leftover money. My parents discourage me from getting a part-time\
  \ job because they want me to get good grades and go to a good college. \n\n\nI\
  \ have always stuck to the shopping list and have never been tempted to buy anything\
  \ extra until today. I saw some red-fleshed dragon fruits. I recalled having some\
  \ a while ago and they were super amazing. I didn\u2019t check the price because\
  \ I didn\u2019t think they would be super expensive and put two of them in my cart.\
  \ I went to check out and found out the two of them costed nearly $20. They were\
  \ much more expensive than I thought, but it would be embarrassing to tell the cashier\
  \ I don\u2019t want them at this point and I really wanted to try them again after\
  \ such a long hiatus. I paid for them and carried the groceries home. \n\n\nMy mom\
  \ kind of blew up on me when she saw the dragon fruits. She said they were a waste\
  \ of money and I should have known that we couldn\u2019t afford to splurge on them.\
  \ Maybe I should have known since five of us share a tiny two bedroom house and\
  \ our shopping lists mainly consist of bread, pasta, bananas, beans, eggs, chicken,\
  \ ground meat, and some common vegetables. I apologized to her and promised to stick\
  \ to the shopping lists from now on."
