selftext: "Couple days ago my fiancee and I were reminiscing about our first couple\
  \ months together. I would go over to her condo, take her out to dinner, and plan\
  \ dates for us. We were intimate with each other but were not having sex. I never\
  \ questioned why till our conversation. She said it was because she was sleeping\
  \ with an old flame while we were in a \"talking\" phase. I was instantly hurt.\
  \ We shared so much time together but [in her words] was getting dicked down by\
  \ someone else. The way she explained it was that it wasn't my business to know\
  \ at the time since we weren't officially an item. Though, a month later is when\
  \ she considers our anniversary of being a couple. Out of emotions I told her I\
  \ felt disgusted. Which I knew hurt her. It wasn't my intention to hurt her. Just\
  \ my reaction.\n\n Regardless of terms used, I can't help but feel jaded and disrespected.\
  \ She's currently giving me the cold shoulder, refusing to try to see it from my\
  \ point of view and thinks I'm being overly sensitive. \n\nAITA for reacting this\
  \ way? Or am I out of the loop when it comes to dating?\n\n\nEdit: more information\
  \ from a comment for clarification. \n\n\nI mean..I was staying the night at her\
  \ house. We would kiss, hold hands, and everything else you'd do in a normal relationship.\
  \ The only thing we did not have at that time was a clear label. I had no idea she\
  \ was still sleeping with someone.She didn't give me any indication that was she\
  \ was entertaining anyone else. But yes, I did try to initiate, she wanted to wait\
  \ for reasons that regarded her sexual health and she said she wanted to build more\
  \ trust in me. (We had been friends for 4 years prior to this) So, hindsight it\
  \ looks like she was just waiting for the opportunity to cut ties with her fuck\
  \ buddy, while building something with me. Though, if she had told me she was still\
  \ sleeping with someone, I wouldn't have pursued a relationship with her at that\
  \ time. Hopefully that clears a little bit up?"
