selftext: "My wife and I were setting up Xmas lights today, and she tells me our 5-year-old\
  \ was asking when the elf on a shelf is coming to our house.  Apparently all the\
  \ other kindergarteners have one and she is feeling left out.  My wife is thinking\
  \ of giving our kids an elf on a shelf and I\u2019m against it. \n\nI don\u2019\
  t like lying to my kids.  My parents didn\u2019t exaggerate Santa, neither denying\
  \ or confirming his existence and our presents were always labeled \u201CLove, Mom\
  \ and Dad.\u201D  I basically take the same approach with our kids(5 and 3) telling\
  \ them that kids believe in Santa but adults don\u2019t. \n\nI hate for my daughter\
  \ to feel left out, but it\u2019s also important for me not to feed into nonsense\
  \ about elves taking their present wishlist to the north pole and spying on them\
  \ and all the rest.  And, if I\u2019m honest, I don\u2019t want that creepy thing\
  \ in my house. \n\nSo Reddit, AITA for not wanting to give my kids Elf on a Shelf?"
