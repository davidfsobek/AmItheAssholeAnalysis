selftext: "Background:\n\nBf is an ex-Muslim from a conservative Muslim family. His\
  \ family subscribes to traditional gender roles, the men in his family are sexist\
  \ (his own words) and, as per Islam, the women in his family dress modestly.\n\n\
  In contrast, I am from a somewhat liberal Christian family. Each part of a couple\
  \ (married or otherwise) is somewhat equal. In a lot of cases, the woman is naturally\
  \ more dominant. How modestly you dress is up to you.\n\nLast bit of context, my\
  \ dad is from a conservative Christian family much like my bf's in that the women\
  \ dress modestly and traditional gender roles are the order of the day. He has now\
  \ learnt to be more liberal and accepting of other ways of living. Modesty was \\\
  *never\\* forced on me even by him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSituation:\n\nI have decided\
  \ that I feel comfortable going without a bra. I also feel like it must be healthier,\
  \ but I haven't done any research in that regard. It even bothers me that I need\
  \ to give a  reason for why I don't want to wear a bra as it's MY body and I feel\
  \ I should be able to wear (or not wear) whatever I like.\n\nBf is generally supportive\
  \ and is working on unlearning the unhealthy parts of his upbringing (as we all\
  \ should). He doesn't insist on modesty unless I'm visiting him at his parents'\
  \ home - even then, it's more of a request for the sake of his parents and I happily\
  \ oblige.\n\nHe is, however, uncomfortable with my going braless. From what he says,\
  \ I understand that it's the idea of another man seeing/lusting after my nipples\
  \ that bothers him. I have explained that men (and other genders) will lust after\
  \ you, regardless of what you're wearing. Even the idea of having to dress a certain\
  \ way to avoid wandering eyes is something that I am vehemently against as it's\
  \ extra effort for little to no reward... extra effort, not for myself, but to \\\
  *maybe\\* make others more comfortable. Plus, my body my rules, right?\n\nBf has\
  \ admitted to being somewhat controlling in past relationships, something that he\
  \ is not proud of and is working on. This feels like an attempt to control under\
  \ the guise of insecurity. As invalidating as that sounds, that is exactly how I\
  \ feel. I don't know what to do. I want to help him and I definitely don't want\
  \ to make him feel insecure if I can help it... but not at the cost of my own values.\n\
  \nAs much as every bone in my body wants to go braless, I fear I might be the asshole,\
  \ clinging to my own comfort and ideals over my boyfriend's insecurities.\n\nHelp\
  \ me, reddit. AITA??\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I'm getting pasties! \n\nThank you to\
  \ those that suggested them and to all of you for weighing in. I spoke to bf and\
  \ he seems to be on board so this is a great compromise."
