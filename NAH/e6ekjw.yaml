selftext: "Hey guys this is my first reddit post and im honestly kinda unsure how\
  \ to feel about this. Let me give you guys a backstory, me and my brother came from\
  \ nothing. We rented rooms growing up living with various people when i was 12 and\
  \ i was moving schools almost every year. He has been working on his clothing company\
  \ for a couple years and it finally started going good around 2016- now. He has\
  \ acquired enough wealth to get us out from nothing to something, after some time\
  \ we got a house with him and his friends. \n\nThey all pay rent and so do i, i\
  \ pay about $300 a month for a shared room and his friends pay like $400 a month\
  \ for a shared room.  Im 19 now and he flaunts his wealth getting so many 5 digit\
  \ brand deals, he told me i have it too easy in life which i think i do have it\
  \ that easy in life, i have a roof over my head i pay for all my necessities / gas\
  \ and all of that. I kinda got upset with him because i thought that now that hes\
  \ acquired some wealth that maybe our lives could get easier, but hes trying to\
  \ raise my rent by double telling me i have it too easy. Also i know that i have\
  \ it good and hes a very loving brother. I just hoped that maybe with this success\
  \ i could finally pursue school full time which i am with 20 college units and hoping\
  \ to transfer out by next year. \n\nto sum it all up\nAm i the asshole for getting\
  \ a upset for thinking that maybe our lives would get easier even after all this\
  \ success so that i could pursue school full time.\n\n* edit, thank you guys for\
  \ your thoughts it seems i am the asshole and will grind even harder to make ends\
  \ meets while trying to pursue my education!"
