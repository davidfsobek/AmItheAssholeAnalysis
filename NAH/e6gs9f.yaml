selftext: 'I have a friend who is actively gay but he''s stuck in this situation where
  his father is telling him he''s sinful. He doesn''t live with his father so it''s
  more of a judgement from afar but it''s really getting into his head.


  I just feel like I''ve had the conversation a thousand times. Listened to him. But
  he''s gotten slowly more crazy about it. He won''t get help. Won''t cut contact.
  I want to do something but I don''t know what to do and I''m reaching the point
  where I just don''t want to answer the phone at the moment because it''s like he
  won''t make the leap but just wants to replay the traumatic situation over and over'
