  First of all, about a year ago I decided that I wanted to find out where my ancestors
  came from as I don''t exactly look like my nationality and I was curious. I got
  one of those DNA kits in the mail...etc etc.


  A few months later I receive an email from the company to say that they have found
  a parent/child match with me. I am clearly the child in this case and the match
  was a women. I know 100% that my mother carried me and gave birth to me so I just
  wrote it off as an error. I was a bit sceptical about the whole thing anyway. Note:
  I am an IVF baby.


  Anyway, a few days ago I decided to message this woman to see if i would get a reply
  though not actually expecting one. This woman replied and it turns out that she
  donated her eggs in the same time period that I was born and also in the actual
  municipality that we lived and where my parent''s fertility clinic was.


  I spoke to my sister about these findings as I don''t know if I should confront
  my parents or not. My whole life I have been led to believe that I am both of my
  parents biological child - just through IVF.


  It might be important to note that I am a triplet and now my sister is questioning
  whether we are related or not. I am very certain that my father is my father as
  I look very much like him. There is no question there. I have always thought that
  my sister looks like my mother''s sister and hence I''ve never had to question otherwise.
  Now we are wondering if we have the same father but our mother is not biologically
  our mother? Or are my other siblings products of my mother''s egg and I am the odd
  one out? Are we all products of different donor eggs?  Has there been a mistake
  at the fertility clinic?


  WIBTA if I questioned my parents? They knew I was getting this DNA kit and did not
  seem concerned at all that I might uncover something they didn''t want me to know.
  I love my mother, she raised me and for all intents and purposes is my mother. I
  do not want to have any contact with this other woman but I do feel lied to for
  my entire life. I have no idea if my parents have known all along that they used
  donor eggs and just pretended that we are biologically theirs. What if there was
  malpractice at the fertility clinic?


  EDIT: Word use. I didn''t mean to sound so confrontational regarding questioning
  my parents.


  EDIT 2: I live in the United States and we are fraternal (separate eggs). I want
  to make it clear that my family who raised me are my family no matter what. I don''t
  care who is biologically related to who. I am more curious than anything.'
