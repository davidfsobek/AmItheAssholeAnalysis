selftext: I work in the ED and a pt presented after an exposure to HIV. The physician
  saw and evaluated them and prescribed the standard PEP. Going over his discharge
  papers I summarized his visit summary, instructions, and diagnosis which was 1.
  encounter for screening of HIV 2. high risk homosexual behavior I was on autopilot
  mode while reading through everything, which we are instructed to go over with each
  patient at discharge. After the fact, I realized what I had just said. I do not
  believe my tone was judgmental or anything because I was reading words absentmindedly,
  but since I was on autopilot mode I cannot be 100% sure. However the pt seemed taken
  aback by the diagnosis and he just glared at me as if I had taken a shit in his
  breakfast. It should be noted that the doctor is the one who made the diagnosis
  and put the ICD10 code in the chart for billing purposes. The diagnoses are right
  there so if he bothered to read through it, he would have seen it at any rate. Though
  embarrassed I pretended like nothing had happened and finished discharging and moved
  on to the next patient.
