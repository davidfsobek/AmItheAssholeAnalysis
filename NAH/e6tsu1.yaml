selftext: 'Tonight, at our holiday party, there was a murder mystery event held by
  an outside troupe. There was a contest to solve the murders, with first place being
  4 NFL tickets and second place being a $100 gift card.


  Three of us tied for first place, so the troupe randomly selected who got first
  and who got second. I got second! The members of the troupe announced the winners
  and took pictures with 1st place; grats him!


  A moment later, our office manager went up and whispered to the MC. He then announced
  that 3rd place was getting the gift card and I was getting nothing. In a room full
  of 100 people, I laughed with everyone else and didn''t make a scene.


  After the event, our office manager told me, in front of my boss, that she didn''t
  think I''d mind since I had won a different a contest at Thanksgiving. Again, I
  didn''t feel in a position to complain.


  But on my ride home, I got annoyed. I feel like, if three of us tied for first,
  it''s on the company to split the prizes up. Did first place really need all 4 tickets?
  Could it have been 2x $50 gift cards instead?


  I don''t know. I just feel like I lost $100 and it sucks.'
