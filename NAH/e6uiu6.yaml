selftext: "My sister knew and proceeded with a T21 baby birth due to religious reasons.\
  \ I advised her against it due to the health and complications they will have to\
  \ deal with as their first child. But told her ultimately it\u2019s her decision\
  \ and I\u2019d love her either way. The baby is less than 2 months old and she\u2019\
  s already doing all the paper work for what if scenarios. She\u2019s asked me and\
  \ my fianc\xE9 to assume control over her child in the event something happened\
  \ to both of them. I sort of feel like this could have waited till later and feel\
  \ blind sided and rushed to make a decision. T21 is for life and we don\u2019t even\
  \ know how severe their disabilities will be or the costs associated. We wanna start\
  \ a family of our own and barely make it as is. Anyway would love to hear everyone\u2019\
  s thoughts as I\u2019m overwhelmed with guilt. For not just saying yes sign me up!"
