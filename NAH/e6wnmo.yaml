selftext: "\nExams start today and the library is packed. You need to be in before\
  \ 8 to get a decent desk. The section I study in is a very popular area and it\u2019\
  s busy all year round and people tend to \u2018save\u2019 seats. \n\nI got in at\
  \ ten to 8 and the only seats left were the \u2018saved\u2019 ones. I went to the\
  \ desk that had the least amount of effort put in, having just a notebook and water\
  \ bottle left on it, put the stuff on the floor and started studying. \n\nAt 10\
  \ to 9 I got a tap on my shoulder and was asked why I moved the guy\u2019s stuff.\
  \ I told him you can\u2019t save seats it\u2019s not fair. He told me he was in\
  \ first thing, left book to keep his seat and went for breakfast and if I wanted\
  \ a seat I should have been here earlier. He told me this was his seat and would\
  \ get security. \n\nI told him that there is a policy that if desks were left for\
  \ more then 45 minutes, there things would be moved and if he wanted a seat he should\
  \ not have left for over an hour. I told him to go get security because I\u2019\
  m not moving. \n\nHe called me a spastic and left. \n \nPeople were looking at us\
  \ the whole time and it was a bit embarrassing. I don\u2019t know how I feel about\
  \ it. \n\nSo, am I the asshole for not moving?"
