selftext: "My babysitter smokes (not when babysitting) and I can tell that she tries\
  \ to cover the smell with cheap, super musty drugstore perfume right before walking\
  \ into my house. When she leaves, my couch and baby (3 month) both REEK of this\
  \ disgusting combination. I\u2019ve gotten to where I have to flip the couch cushions\
  \ and wash my baby every time she leaves. Other than this she\u2019s great and snuggles\
  \ my baby the entire time, which is awesome (but also leads to the saturation of\
  \ the smell.) My husband think we should just not ask her back because it\u2019\
  s rude to tell her to not smoke or wear perfume. I\u2019m torn so, of course, I\u2019\
  ve come to you! What do you think?\n\nEdit: She has told me she loves \u201Ccheap\
  \ perfume\u201D and that she gets it from the drugstore. Apparently her mom used\
  \ to buy it for her as a child and that\u2019s why she loves it."
