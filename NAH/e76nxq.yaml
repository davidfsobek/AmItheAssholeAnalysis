selftext: 'My wife wanted to go to graduate school in a different state in a city
  ten times bigger than where we previously lived.  I had been wanting to get out
  of our rural area for a while so I found a job and we relocated.  Parking anywhere
  near my office is expensive and the city has great public transport from just outside
  our home to a block from my office I can take a bus.  I understood this when moving,
  and my plan was to primarily use public transportation.  With this in mind we sold
  one of our cars before moving.

  My job is stressful and often requires more than 8 hour days.  Usually I am fine
  taking the bus, but today I worked 7am to 5pm without a chance to take a break.  It
  was a really busy day and I could not face taking a crowded bus for 45 minutes to
  get home.  I asked my wife for a ride and she said she didnt feel up to picking
  me up.  This is often her answer and she rarely concedes to picking me up on these
  kind of days.

  Now, I do not believe my wife should drop everything and be at my beckon call.  However,
  she takes our teen daughter anywhere she wants to go and picks her up at any time.  We
  often have to build our vehicle schedule around her social life.  Today, I sucked
  it up and took the bus.  When I got home my wife is not here.  I find out she is
  out driving my daughter to her friends house, even after we had a talk earlier in
  the week about her going out too much and staying out too late.

  I am really upset that the kids social life is worth making the trip, but I am left
  to just deal with it.  I have not spoken to my wife yet, but I am not sure if being
  resentful makes me an asshole.  I am not going to be angry with my wife, maybe I
  am just more hurt and want perspective before broaching the situation.

  UPDATE:  I did talk to my wife last night.  Apparently the issue arose from a misunderstanding
  and bad timing.  Our daughter was given permission to go to a friend''s house after
  school prior to us talking about her going out too much.  My wife felt that because
  the plan was made before the talk, she would still be allowed to go (as she was
  not being punished for anything, we were just setting general expectations.  My
  daughter thought she had been disallowed from going out and came home directly after
  school.  My wife told her she was still allowed to go out.  When I asked for a ride
  she was doing dishes.  When she finished she felt bad about the miscommunication
  and gave my daughter the ride.


  I feel like an asshole for being frustrated and upset without all the details.  Thank
  you all for giving me some perspective.'
