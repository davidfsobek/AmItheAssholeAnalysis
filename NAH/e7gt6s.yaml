selftext: "Parents are divorced for about 2 decades.  I grew up primarily with my\
  \ mother.  I\u2019m looking to purchase my first home where my mother would need\
  \ to co-sign, but I would be responsible for each mortgage payment and down payment.\
  \  \n\nMy father has a second home that he rents out that would be 45 minutes further\
  \ from my job from where I\u2019m looking for a house currently.  He offered it\
  \ rent free for a few years while he remodels it.\n\nThe current family living in\
  \ that home has lived there for 10 years and is currently renting month to month.\
  \  I don\u2019t know them at all.  My concern though was evicting them with a few\
  \ months notice even though they have been good tenants.  I have no idea how that\
  \ could affect their personal lives, but my parents don\u2019t seem to care.\n\n\
  My mother has been emotional because according to her, this has been the first time\
  \ my father had a financial contribution after the divorce.  She is financially\
  \ successful herself, but it\u2019s the fact that he offered this that\u2019s important\
  \ to her.\n\nI just don\u2019t feel comfortable evicting a family, but my parents\
  \ feel differently."
