selftext: 'To sum this odd situation up, I am black and have dark brown earwax. Until
  recently, I didn''t realize that white people have yellow earwax. I did some research
  on why earwax colour varies with race but honestly didn''t come up with much. I
  was curious as to what colour a mixed race person''s earwax is. Looking back, this
  is probably a dumb question.


  Anyways, I went ahead and asked my mixed friend (half black and half white) what
  colour her earwax was. She was super offended and told me that I was really rude
  for asking.


  I am still super confused. I know it''s a weird question but I didn''t mean to be
  rude (and I didnt ask in a rude way). AITA?'
