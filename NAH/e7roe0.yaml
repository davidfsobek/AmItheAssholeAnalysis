selftext: "My kids wanted to go to a park near the house today and after a lot of\
  \ stalling on my part, I finally agreed, and they were *thrilled*. \n\nIt\u2019\
  s not a huge park, just a little local job with a play structure and a couple swings\
  \ directly adjacent. \n\nI get there and see a kid having a full blown meltdown\
  \ about not being able to go into the park and the mother was telling her \u201C\
  I know I promised but we can\u2019t go today\u201D and I couldn\u2019t help but\
  \ overhear it, but it was none of my business, so I kept on. \n\nBut the mother\
  \ stopped me and whispered \u201CThere\u2019s a homeless guy living in the play\
  \ structure, you don\u2019t want your kids in there.\u201D\n\nI wasn\u2019t really\
  \ sure what she meant but knew how amped my kids had been for the park so decided\
  \ I had to see for myself. \n\nSure enough there was a guy sleeping under the covered\
  \ portion of the play structure. I thought about it for a second and this park was\
  \ put here for kids to play in. We have other municipal structures in place for\
  \ homeless people. \n\nSo I went over and called to him and said it was morning,\
  \ the park was now in use, so he needed to continue on. \n\nHe ignored me and went\
  \ back to sleep. I told him if he didn\u2019t leave the playground I\u2019d have\
  \ to call someone. He muttered something to the effect of \u201Cgo away.\u201D\n\
  \nI called the police\u2019s non emergency number and explained the situation. They\
  \ sent a cop over who talked to him and assessed his state of mind and determined\
  \ he was fine and offered him some resources and a ride. \n\nThe guy refused to\
  \ leave. The cop told him he\u2019d have to leave. He got into it with the cop.\
  \ The cop told him leave now or be arrested now. The guy eventually left. \n\nNow\
  \ I\u2019m in bed, and can\u2019t help think about where the guy is sleeping and\
  \ wonder if I should\u2019ve just taken the kids to the park another time and not\
  \ escalated things. AITA?"
