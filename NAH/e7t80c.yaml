selftext: "I recently was offered a promotion at my job that would entail 4-5 years\
  \ of training beforehand. I was hand selected for this training. Because of this,\
  \ I\u2019m planning to dedicate at least 10-15 years at the location I work at.\n\
  \nI should add that my job previously had a lot of fluidity in location and flexibility\
  \ because there are numerous locations throughout the country that are always hiring\
  \ and this was never a problem.\n\nThe issue becomes the fact that my girlfriend\
  \ of two years doesn\u2019t want to stay in the same town she\u2019s finishing up\
  \ college in, that I live in. She wants to move ASAP. \n\nAITA for accepting this\
  \ promotion without talking to her about it or should I put my career before my\
  \ relationship?"
