selftext: "A little background info here I used to be a very obese kid (215lb in 7th\
  \ grade). Around that time I went through my weight loss journey and I dropped about\
  \ 65lb. They way I did it though was in a very unhealthy way. Flash forward to around\
  \ May of this year I\u2019ve started to really focus on my diet (counting calories\
  \ and making sure I\u2019m getting enough vitamins,etc). To bring it back to the\
  \ topic I don\u2019t eat the foods my mom cooks because 1. It\u2019s no healthy\
  \ 2. There\u2019s no way for me to track cals and etc. Because of that I meal prep\
  \ and cook for myself."
