selftext: 'Last year I (31M) was got diagnosed with cancer with some relatively early
  detection. The first year, I did not need treatment but now I need to start...this
  week. Throughout this whole 12 month ordeal, my wife (26F) has been nothing but
  supportive. I really can''t describe just how awesome my wife is in general because
  every other guy in existence would surely die of jealousy while every woman on earth
  would tremble at the realization they would never be a better partner than my wife.
  But I digress. For reference, she has come with me to the oncologist twice now which
  coincided with times he wanted both of us there.



  I am starting treatment this week and it the first day involves at least 6 hours
  of infusions and a whole bunch of other fun things you get to enjoy when one has
  cancer. The thing is, I don''t want my wife to come with me.



  * I don''t feel like having company is going to make things better.

  * I hate the cancer impacting the day-to-day activities of more than just me.

  * If things get not so pretty, I want to maintain some of my dignity.



  So would I be the asshole if I ask her to not come? I have already broached the
  subject asking why she would like to join me and she 100% wants to be supportive.
  We have a great relationship and can be honest with each other but my dad never
  prepared me for this conversation in life so I turn to you, kind strangers of the
  internet, to give me advice.


  **Edit**

  Kind strangers of the internet, thank you so much for your insights and wishes of
  good health!'
