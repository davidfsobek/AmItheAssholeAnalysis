selftext: "Hi,\n\nWondering if I'm in the wrong here. I thought I was being generous.\
  \ My girlfriend has owed me some $ for a while - about $400 for a flight and car\
  \ repair I paid for for her. I did so under the pretenses that it was a loan, not\
  \ a gift, and that I expected to be paid back. We're pretty fair and usually rotate\
  \ paying for dinner/etc unless it's a special occasion (birthday, holiday, etc)\
  \ in which case I pay in full. It's important to note that we've been dating for\
  \ about 10 months, and we're not at the point in our relationship where we share\
  \ finances. I'm not exactly broke but I'm not rich either. I asked her, nicely,\
  \ about two months ago whether she was going to be able to pay me back and she was\
  \ adamant that she would. I mentioned it again about a month ago and she told me\
  \ not to worry and that she would pay me back. \n\nFor her birthday, she mentioned\
  \ that she wanted the new Airpods Pro - I didn't once ever make her believe that\
  \ I was getting them for her, it was just something she had mentioned a few times\
  \ in passing. Her birthday rolls around, and I took her out to a nice fancy dinner\
  \ and got her flowers and a card. As her \"gift\", I decided to wipe her debt away.\
  \ It was starting to drive a wedge between us and I didn't want it to be hanging\
  \ over the both of us going forward, as I intend to be with her for a while. She\
  \ was *pissed* about this, and told me that it isn't a gift and I'm an asshole for\
  \ even considering it. Am I in the wrong here? I genuinely thought I was doing something\
  \ nice, and $400 is much more than I would have spent on a gift. Let me know if\
  \ I'm wrong.\n\nThanks,\n\nEdit: lots of people messaging me saying I\u2019m a terrible\
  \ boyfriend and that a man should support a woman financially. First of all, no.\
  \ Second of all, I\u2019m a woman and we are lesbians. I should\u2019ve been more\
  \ explicit about that but I didn\u2019t think it was material to the situation."
