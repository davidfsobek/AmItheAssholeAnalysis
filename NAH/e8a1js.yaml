selftext: "So, I came out of the closet a few months ago, and my family took it VERY\
  \ well. Especially my dad. Let me start by saying that I think of my dad as a hero.\
  \ He's a great guy who has always been there for me when I needed it. \n\nThe thing\
  \ that bothers me though, is the fact that he tells people about my sexuality whenever\
  \ the subject comes up. Usually, I don't see this as much of an issue, since I know\
  \ he does it because he's so proud of me, but recently I have been getting a little\
  \ worried as I know there are people in the family that will not approve of it.\
  \  \n\n\nThe reason why this bothers me so much is that I know my father has the\
  \ tendency to let things slip if he's excited about them, and I don't want the homophobes\
  \ of the family to figure out what's going on, because it will cause a lot of tension\
  \ on the family. \n\nSo WIBTA if I ask my dad to stop telling people about my sexuality,\
  \ fearing the ones that do not approve find out about it?\n\nEdit: thanks for all\
  \ the responses! This definitely cleared things up for me. I will discuss the issue\
  \ with my dad later tonight. I'm sure he'll understand when I explain things to\
  \ him. Again, thank you kind strangers!\n\nUPDATE: \nSo, me and my dad had a chat\
  \ about the issue, and fortunately, he understands why him telling everyone bothers\
  \ me, even if it wasn't his intention to make me uncomfortable in the first place.\
  \ Having taken that into consideration, he promised me not to do it again unless\
  \ he has my permission, and knowing him, he will keep his word. Safe to say this\
  \ has a happy ending to it, haha. \n\nThanks again for the comments and support.\
  \ I really appreciate it."
