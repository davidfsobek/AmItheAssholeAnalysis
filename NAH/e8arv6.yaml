selftext: 'So, my parents got divorced when I was 13, they split up without any issue
  and I am close to both my mother and my father and they live about 20 minutes from
  each other and I can go to either one as I please pretty much.


  Now in comes John, the guy my mom is dating. She met John about 1 year and 5 months
  ago and they have been dating ever since, I knew about this but I had never met
  John as I think my mom did not want me to meet him until she was certain there was
  a future and all of that.


  Now this finally changed about 2 months ago, she brought John home and had him meet
  me. Now John seems like a friendly guy, I have no issue with him and I figured I''d
  have to be nice and accepting and all of that not to make my mom look bad so well
  that is what I did, I spend some time with him, asked him about his life and all
  of that so the first meeting went just fine.


  After this I met John a few more times, he invited my mom to have lunch with him
  and asked if I wanted to come along that sort of stuff and I did not want to be
  rude so accepted. Now things like this kept happening over a 1 month period where
  John would invite me along, I would try to be nice and all of that.


  Then about a month ago my mom came to my room to talk to me and asked me if I liked
  John, I said he seems nice. She said she is very happy we are getting along so well
  because John asked her to marry him and will be moving in with us. Now I sort of
  shut down at this point, like having a guy I barely know move in? I know this would
  have happened eventually but it seems like it makes sense to first you know, create
  a relationship before forcing me to live with this guy? But regardless I figured
  him moving in would be after the marriage and there would be a lot of time to get
  to know the guy, nope, he moved in the next day.


  Ever since he moved in I have been avoiding him, I am not rude or anything like
  that but to me he is a stranger living in my home and it makes me feel really on
  edge. My mom keeps trying to get me to spend time with John asking me to watch a
  movie with her and then inviting John as well and my mom leaving the room because
  she "Had to get some more groceries" that sort of stuff. Also John started to try
  and "Parent" me telling me to tidy up my room and shit like that, now my room is
  tidy, I am not 10 and he is not my parent so I told him to sod off in a nice way


  After a month of this I told my mom I am going to be moving in with my dad and well
  she started crying and asked me why and I figured it was best to just be honest
  and told her because a stranger was living in the house. She got mad at me and said
  she thought I like John to which I replied by saying I hardly know John and she
  said that is because I make no effort to get to know him.


  I had to remove some stuff because the post was too long, sorry.'
