selftext: '*Using a throwaway because my friends know my main account. Sorry for my
  poor grammar. English it''s not my first language.


  My (37M) wife (37F) moved from her home country to be with me 3 years ago. She never
  worked before and went to University here. I share my finances with her and pay
  for everything since the time she moved here. I barely take any vacation because
  of my work pressure whereas she went on some trips to other country etc. She recently
  (since August) started working. Even though she is highly educated than me, because
  of the fields that we are in I make almost 4x more than her. She is unhappy about
  her pay and many times mentioned about the difference in our pay and qualifications.
  She was very unhappy when she received her first pay cheque.


  She transfers all her salary to clear her education loan in her home country, which
  is something I suggested and both of us decided that it''s the best thing to do.
  BTW, her school cost in our country (which I paid for, no conditions) is almost
  similar to her loan from before. She even bought a laptop for her mother recently
  as soon as she got her first salary.


  I recently mentioned that it would mean a lot to me if she would''ve at least taken
  me out for a coffee and paid for it with her card. Not in monetary value but just
  as a symbolic act of sharing her hard earned money with me. I asked her if that
  ever occurred to her? For which, she said that her salary makes her unhappy and
  that I needed to ask her clearly if I wanted something from her etc. This kind of
  really made me unhappy and sad.


  AITA for expecting her to take me out and expressing my unhappiness when she was
  completely callous about it?'
