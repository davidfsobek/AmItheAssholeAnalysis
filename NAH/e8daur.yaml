selftext: "This is my second office job and I just don't like going to office events.\
  \ I went a lot at my first job and hated every single one, so at this job I've just\
  \ not gone. They do happy hours, breakfasts, sporting events, plays, and most recently\
  \ a Christmas party. \n\nI have skipped every office event in the past year that\
  \ I've been here. I went to the Christmas party this past weekend and everyone was\
  \ making comments like \"oh Winter-Cockroach actually showed up\" and other comments\
  \ in the same spirit. It was annoying (but I'd not let that show and would laugh\
  \ it off) and I left promptly at 8:00pm (the time noted on the invitations as the\
  \ ending time), which made me the first to leave. \n\nI've been getting some more\
  \ passive aggressive comments about my unwillingness to attend company get togethers,\
  \ all of which I've brushed/laughed off like I do after any event. However, my date\
  \ to the Christmas party mentioned that it was clear to her that people weren't\
  \ happy that I don't attend, and that it's kind of an asshole move to be this standoffish\
  \ to people that I claim to like (working with). \n\nAm I the asshole? Does it really\
  \ matter if you participate in office events?"
