selftext: "I live with my mom, my stepdad, and my younger brother. I like my stepdad\
  \ and don't have a problem with him, but I don't think of him as my dad. He and\
  \ my mom asked me if I wanted my stepdad to adopt me. I said yes at first, but when\
  \ they started talking to a lawyer and I learned more about what an adoption meant,\
  \ I decided I don't want to. \n\nI think it would be disrespecting the memory of\
  \ my real dad, who was a good dad when he was alive, by pretending that someone\
  \ else is my dad. Saying that my stepdad is my dad would be like faking my life.\
  \ Also, I don't think this will happen but if my mom and stepdad got divorced before\
  \ I'm 18, they would probably have shared custody and I'd be forced to visit or\
  \ live with my stepdad. If they did get divorced, I'd rather not be forced by a\
  \ judge to see my stepdad. My mom told me it would be easier for my stepdad to take\
  \ me to the doctor or handle things with school, but I don't want that. It would\
  \ actually be really weird. I asked my mom to not tell my stepdad about medical\
  \ stuff because it's embarrassing, so I really wouldn't want him to be able to talk\
  \ to my doctor or my teachers by himself.\n\nWould I be an asshole if I told them\
  \ I changed my mind and I didn't want to be adopted even though they got their hopes\
  \ up and already started seeing a lawyer? I wouldn't tell them that I'm afraid of\
  \ them getting divorced because I think that would hurt their feelings."
