selftext: "I always see people say \"mobile, excuse formatting\" so there's that disclaimer.\
  \ Always looks fine to me, although that's probably because I'm exclusively a mobile\
  \ user. \n\nMy family, fiance, and I picked a venue for our wedding. We were lucky\
  \ to get anything with the timeline/date we were looking at, but we found a nice\
  \ lodge that worked well for us. Our parents are paying for the wedding and put\
  \ down a sizable, non-refundable deposit. \n\nRecently, I start seeing news articles\
  \ about plantation weddings, all about how glorifying plantations is awful and partying\
  \ on those grounds is repugnant. My first feeling is total agreement. My second\
  \ feeling is that of my heart falling into my stomach. I live in the south. What\
  \ are the chances that this lodge housed slaves?\n\nPretty good, as it turns out.\
  \ I had to go about four websites deep to find it, but there it was.\n\nYes, I should\
  \ have known. Yes, I should have done my homework before hand. I'm extremely upset\
  \ about my thoughtlessness and think I know how the verdict on this post will turn\
  \ out, but I have to ask before I cancel this wedding and empty my coffers to pay\
  \ our parents back the deposit-\n\nWIBTA to have my wedding as planned, at a former\
  \ plantation house? I'm hesitant to give details about the date but what I'll say\
  \ is this: A lot of arrangements have been made, but I don't think it's impossible\
  \ to cancel. \n\n\nSend me all the hate mail you want, I'm right there with you."
