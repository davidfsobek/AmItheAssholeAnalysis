selftext: "Me (F23) and my bf (M24) have need together for nearly five years, we recently\
  \ had a big discussion about him not being honest about his mood and general attitude\
  \ \n\nHe will always say yes to whatever I propose, even if he doesn't want to go\
  \ along with it one bit, which doesn't sound so bad until one realizes, he can't\
  \ fake it; he will be all moody, and coy and quiet. I've planned entire parties\
  \ where beforehand he sounds truly excited and the day of the event he won't even\
  \ smile at anybody, he thinks saying yes to my every desire makes me happy, it doesn't,\
  \ I'm miserable just watching all my efforts go down the drain just because he couldn't\
  \ say he wasn't in the mood or that he wanted something different.\n\nSo we had\
  \ this discussion, and he promised to try and be more honest, so now, he flakes\
  \ out of everything, we had a dinner date planned 'oh, I don't know, I've had so\
  \ much work'; there's this event I really want to go to 'but I'm too tired' \n\n\
  He went from doing everything with a moody face to doing nothing, he's driving me\
  \ insane and I don't know how to bring it up.\n\nAITA for expecting him to have\
  \ a balance?"
