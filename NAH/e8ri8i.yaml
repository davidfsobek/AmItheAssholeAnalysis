selftext: "\n\nI need an answer, am I a shitty friend. R is a friend of mine and C,\
  \ our other friend is with him. R is a diabetic and he hadn\u2019t taken his medication,\
  \ so he started feeling really ill and couldn\u2019t walk. He also was apparently\
  \ vomiting. C called me, asking me to drive R to the hospital because he thought\
  \ I had my car with me. C and R do not have access to cars. I am currently studying\
  \ for my physics final in 3 hours and didn\u2019t want to leave the library. I also\
  \ felt that it\u2019d be faster if my roommate Z took him since he\u2019s at our\
  \ apartment with his car. So I called Z and asked him to go, I also checked to make\
  \ sure Z didn\u2019t have any assignments or upcoming exams. If he was busy today\
  \ I would have walked back home and driven over to take him. Z  was able to take\
  \ C and R to the hospital, and I am currently still studying. I feel like I\u2019\
  m an asshole here due to the intent behind my actions. Though it was more practical\
  \ and faster for Z to take C and R, I did not drop what I was doing to help out\
  \ a friend. I also feel that I put Z in a shitty situation by asking him to do something\
  \ like this."
