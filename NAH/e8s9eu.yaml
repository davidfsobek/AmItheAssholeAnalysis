selftext: "Our son is 14 and has been undergoing treatment for an illness for the\
  \ past three years and it's still not over yet.\n\nThe whole treatment process has\
  \ been extremely difficult for our son and despite our best efforts to help him\
  \ mentally, it has changed him from a really sweet loving child to someone who lashes\
  \ out terribly. And we know puberty has played a large part of it as well.\n\nUnfortunately,\
  \ his behavior at home has disrupted his siblings' lives greatly. He's the third\
  \ of 4 children. It's gotten to the the point where my youngest daughter is deeply\
  \ unhappy and has started saying she hates her brother. The older children have\
  \ also made their feelings known.\n\nWe've tried correcting the behavior but he's\
  \ very clearly in physical pain and it's affecting his behavior. We've tried therapy\
  \ as well, both individual and family.\n\nIn an effort to create peace in our home,\
  \ we made a decision to move our son into my parents' guesthouse. My wife and I\
  \ take turns sleeping there so my son is never left without a parent there. My parents\
  \ also spend a lot of time with him \n\nThis has made our house peaceful and positive\
  \ again. And the other children are happier. But our son has taken it very badly\
  \ and his behavior has worsened. My wife regularly returns from her time with him\
  \ in tears. It has gotten to me a few times too.\n\nMy wife and I feel really guilty\
  \ but we didn't know what else to do. A nurse found our what we did and told us\
  \ that good family support can make a difference in surviving an illness and we\
  \ made a mistake. She was immediately reprimanded by a doctor but my wife and I\
  \ are feeling worse than before.\n\nMy son's therapist said we didn't have any choice\
  \ but my mother also feels like maybe we should've tried harder to keep him in our\
  \ home.\n\nDid we make a mistake?"
title: AITA for having our ill son stay at my parents because we can't handle his
  behavior?
