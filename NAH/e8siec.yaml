selftext: "My wife hates insects and touching fish, yet she loves going camping and\
  \ fishing (as do I). \n\nHowever, whenever we go camping, inevitably, insects will\
  \ enter the tent, car, land near food etc. This really bothers her and she will\
  \ leave the area until I have killed the insect. Whenever possible, I try to remove\
  \ the insect / spider etc without harming it. She isn\u2019t too happy and worries\
  \ it\u2019ll come back. (She doesn\u2019t get *angry*, just complains a little.)\n\
  \nWhen we go fishing, she asks me to unhook any fish she catches, which isn\u2019\
  t too bad. I don\u2019t mind touching them at all. Somewhat annoying I need to drop\
  \ my rod to help though. But if she wants to cook what she catches, she asks me\
  \ to gut the fish. I am really not keen on this because ...well I feel bad about\
  \ taking its life unnecessarily. The last time we went camping, I refused to gut\
  \ the fish she caught and asked her to let me return it to the pond, as we already\
  \ had plenty of food. She agreed but then complained that she wanted to catch and\
  \ eat fresh fish like we did the last time we went camping. If we had not had any\
  \ food with us, it would have been different.\n\nThe same happens for any insects\
  \ that might enter our home. I always put them outside (unless it\u2019s a wasp)\
  \ and she is worried they\u2019ll find their way back in and asks me to just kill\
  \ them. Today, for example, a bee was in our bedroom. She freaked out and begged\
  \ me to kill it. We have wasp spray so I told her to use that, but she refused and\
  \ said she was scared. So, I did it. But I felt terrible about it...As I put the\
  \ dying bee outside I sincerely wished it would have recovered and flown away. \n\
  \nMy aversion to killing things is not based on any religion or anything. I just\
  \ feel they have the right to life and we shouldn\u2019t take it unless our lives\
  \ are in danger (wasps). I always feel bad when I kill something she asks me to\
  \ and even when I put insects in tissues to toss them outside, I worry I might have\
  \ hurt them. My wife has known that I hate killing / hurting things since we started\
  \ dating, so this isn\u2019t new.\n\nToday I was relaxing downstairs from a long\
  \ and hard day of work when she asked me to go upstairs and kill the bee. I wanted\
  \ to say \u201CFrom now on, if you want something killed, please just do it yourself.\u201D\
  \ \n\nWIBTA if I said that and refused to kill insects, spiders, and fish when she\
  \ asks me?"
title: WIBTA if I told my wife that if she wants something (insect, fish etc) killed
  she should do it herself?
