selftext: 'So I''ve been into the rave scene for a while, but I don''t go very often.
  I usually save up to go to the really big festivals instead of regularly attending
  smaller shows. I genuinely enjoy the music, but I would be lying to say I don''t
  also go for the fun of spending the weekend fucked up. I wanted to go to EDC in
  Las Vegas (it''s in May 2020) and I found someone selling their ticket on fb, so
  I decided to buy it (it''s already sold out). I know two other people who are going,
  and they got a camping pass and said I could camp with them, and basically everything
  seemed to be working out for me.


  Then, I (22M) mentioned it to my boyfriend (24M) and he got really upset. We''ve
  been together for two years, so he knows I like to go to shows, and he even came
  with me to one last year but he said it wasn''t really his scene. He told me he''s
  never been crazy about raves and music festivals, and after going to one he thinks
  it''s basically just an excuse for people to do drugs. He said he''s really uncomfortable
  and a little scared at the idea of me "being on a bender for three days straight"
  at a festival with hundreds of other people who are also tripping balls. He doesn''t
  think it''s safe, and told me he doesn''t want me to go at all. Since the show we
  went to together, I haven''t been to another so I guess he didn''t feel the need
  to mention it until now, but he''s really emotional about this. He said he just
  doesn''t trust raves/people who go to raves and I said since I already bought the
  ticket I''m going to go anyway. I told my friend about this, and they said if me
  going to raves makes him this upset I should prioritize his feelings because it
  doesn''t hurt me to not go, but it will hurt him if I do go.


  The show isn''t until May so I have a lot of time to change my mind, but I thought
  I would ask now anyway. So, Reddit, AITA?


  tl;dr: boyfriend doesn''t want me to go to a rave because he doesn''t like them,
  but I really want to go to the rave.'
