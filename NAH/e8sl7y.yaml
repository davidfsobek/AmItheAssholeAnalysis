selftext: 'I''ve been looking for a new apartment for the last month or so now and
  I think I finally found a good one. It''s very close to my workplace (practically
  walking distance), it''s right up my financial alley and it''s a huge upgrade from
  where I live now. Only issue, according to my boyfriend, is the fact that I''d be
  sharing said apartment with four other people, who are all guys.


  I had dinner with them and they explained the situation; their previous roommate
  had to move due to college and finding a new a roommate would alleviate some of
  the finances considering they were five people previously. The apartment also has
  two bathrooms; they acknowledged that perhaps I''d be uncomfortable with sharing
  a bathroom with guys, so they told me if I was to move in, one of the bathrooms
  would be exclusively mine.


  They gave me a quick tour of the apartment and it''s gorgeous; it''s a modern loft
  apartment and it''s huge so despite potentially five people living there, space
  would definitely not be an issue. I loved everything about the place. They gave
  me a week to decide before they start looking for another potential roommate.


  I had a talk with my boyfriend, who is leaving town for a few months due to work
  and despite not flat out telling me no, he has been very, very passive aggressive
  about it. He''s usually very upfront and honest and this is definitely not like
  him. I mentioned that to him and he dismissed it and keeps telling me that he hopes
  I enjoy my new apartment. I tried to have him meet my potential roommates and he
  keeps coming up with excuses as to why he can''t meet them; which again, is very
  unlike him.


  I have two more days to answer them and I feel bad for making them wait and my boyfriend
  keeps being vague about the whole situation; oh and his flight is tomorrow so that
  definitely isn''t helping me decide.


  Would I be the asshole if I move in despite him being passive aggressive and pretty
  much against it? I''ve been trying to get a concrete answer from him but it seems
  impossible and I don''t want to miss out on the place because I really liked it.'
