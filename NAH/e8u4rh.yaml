  My mother lives in Idaho, and I and my family live in Texas.   My in-laws also live
  here, and naturally get to see us and the kids far more often than my mother and
  her side of the family.   She also has a myriad of health complications that make
  it difficult to travel, and budgeting for the family to go to Idaho hasn''t always
  been at the top of our list.


  With that in mind, I really wanted to take my kids to visit this year, and figured
  their extended Winter break would be the best time to do it.   They''ve got  \~3
  weeks or so from right before Christmas, until shortly after New Years.   I told
  my mom that I wanted to bring the kids out to visit during their Christmas break,
  and she was ecstatic and I said we''d discuss particular dates soon.    Well apparently
  to her, (and a handful of friends I discussed with afterwards) my phrasing implied
  we''d be coming there for Christmas, and told the rest of the family, and began
  making preparations and getting understandably excited.    We''ve already got commitments
  here  (a whole nother story I can explain if necessary) that make being in Texas
  for Christmas the most sensible thing to do.    I was thinking more along the lines
  of going out there the 26th or 27th and staying through New Years, but once I clarified,
  my mom was crushed and suggested if it wasn''t for Christmas then maybe we could
  plan a different/better time.   She definitely wasn''t trying to be petty, but had
  there not been any confusion I''m sure she would have loved to have us for the time
  I suggested.    So now we''re not going, and I feel horrible, but also don''t feel
  like I was misleading or that the confusion was my fault.   All of my friends disagree
  unanimously and say that "if you tell someone you''re coming to visit for Christmas
  break, they will naturally assume you''ll also be there for Christmas."   And while
  I agree that that''s not a huge leap to make, I specifically didn''t say "We''ll
  be there for Christmas"  and it never occurred to me that it would be interpreted
  any other way.

  AITA?

  \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*UPDATE \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*


  I called and talked to my mom to apologize and try and find a solution.  We discussed
  the option of us coming out the day after Christmas and celebrating then, and she
  was really moved at the idea (thanks Reddit) but ultimately didn''t want us spending
  the kind of money last minute tickets during the holidays would cost for the three
  of us.   We settled on her flying out next month for my birthday, and spending a
  week staying with us.   She''s thrilled, kids are pumped, and I''m happy.   I really
  appreciate the advice, and glad I followed up with her.  She also made it VERY clear
  that she was disappointed about the Christmas mix up, but not upset, and especially
  not at me.   Really needed that convo and the outcome!'
