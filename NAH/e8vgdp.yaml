selftext: "My parents divorced when I was 3. My dad was always really bothered by\
  \ it but my mom had no issues moving on. She seemed happier. She got custody of\
  \ me and my dad rarely saw me. When I was 11 he reached out and tried to have more\
  \ of a relationship. During visits with him he would tell me he always loved me\
  \ and seeing me but my mother made it hard with the courts and child support. He\
  \ always bought me things and paid for stuff.\n\nMy mom and I were really close\
  \ until 11. She was my best friend. \n\nLife with my mom was hard. We struggled\
  \ to make ends meet. I never went without the basics but new toys were tough and\
  \ she worked a lot. My dad told me he was paying nearly $860 a month in child support\
  \ and I was always really suspicious with what my mom was doing with it. I was convinced\
  \ she used it on herself, especially after she got a new car. \n\nMy relationship\
  \ with my mom really became strained. My dad would bad mouth her and I believed\
  \ it. \n\nAt 16, I told my mom I wanted to go live with my dad. She seemed hurt\
  \ but she said I could go. Life with my dad was better a bit. Then 6 months in he\
  \ told me my mom got a court order saying I had to go back. I was devastated. I\
  \ saw less of him after that. He would send me money and write and tell me he was\
  \ trying to fight for me. \n\nWhen I turned 18 I left and never spoke to my mom\
  \ again. In my 20s I got involved in a online community that spent a lot of time\
  \ talking about how awful single moms and divorce was and generally hating women.\
  \ It was a toxic place but I felt acknowledged there. \n\nEarlier this year, I finally\
  \ reconnected with my family on my mom\u2019s side and found out some things about\
  \ my dad. I found the court paperwork. How he returned me to my mom. There was never\
  \ any court order to return me. How he never paid child support willingly and how\
  \ much he still owes in back pay. He would job jump to outrun it and it was never\
  \ $850. It was  $200 a month. He has other kids too. Two other wives. I have proof\
  \ of it all. I reached out to a brother a few years younger than me and he had about\
  \ the same story. My dad also stalked and threatened my mom for years so badly she\
  \ had to have a protective order. I never knew any of that. \n\nI haven\u2019t spoken\
  \ to my mom in 13 years. She would try to send me some money and write me at my\
  \ uncle\u2019s house, dad\u2019s brother(where I lived after I left) for a long\
  \ time but I\u2019d always return it unopened. \n\nI have two kids and I really\
  \ want them to know their grandmother. I have thought she was evil for years. I\
  \ blamed her for everything. I called her names for years. \n\nI found out she is\
  \ living out west with her new husband and they have some adoptive children. I want\
  \ to reach out but I don\u2019t want to be an asshole. \n\nWIBTA if I reached out\
  \ and apologized? Or should I just leave it alone and let her go on with her life?"

  her out of my life 13 years ago.
