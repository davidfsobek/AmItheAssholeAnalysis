selftext: "OK, this is a weird one, and I don\u2019t even understand my reaction.\
  \ I just graduated from college. I\u2019m living with my parents in the town I grew\
  \ up in, trying to figure out what to do next. \n\nI\u2019m Indian. Went to school\
  \ in a really white town. I must have been about 16 when this happened, but I was\
  \ in math class sitting with some \u201Cfriends.\u201D I was quiet, and they weren\u2019\
  t very nice to me, but I desperately wanted to be friends with them. I don\u2019\
  t remember how they got on the subject but the girl behind me whispered to one of\
  \ my friends that, \u201CIndians are the reason for all these terrorist attacks,\
  \ and they need to go back to their country.\u201D I literally froze, had no idea\
  \ how to react to what she\u2019d said. My friend kinda laughed and went, \u201C\
  I think you\u2019re talking about Muslims, which are mostly people from the Middle\
  \ East.\u201D She said, \u201CWhatever. All these brown people need to leave. They\u2019\
  re nothing but godawful terrorists, and they\u2019re stealing our jobs.... etc etc.\u201D\
  \ \n\nSo basically a bunch of bullshit that she heard from her Texas lovin\u2019\
  \ parents. I don\u2019t even remember being all that affected by it. It bothered\
  \ me, I didn\u2019t even understand what racism was at that time, but I let it go\
  \ and pretended not to hear when she\u2019d make racist comments about brown people.\
  \ Which she continued to do. A lot. \n\nBy the time we graduated high school, we\
  \ had enough mutual friends that I didn\u2019t hate her or like her. We\u2019d talk\
  \ sometimes, but mostly we didn\u2019t because I think she thought she was better\
  \ than me. \n\nFast forward, I\u2019m back in town and I bump into her. I didn\u2019\
  t even really recognize her, but she said my name and came over to talk to me. It\
  \ was going well-enough. We talked about college, and what we\u2019re doing now.\
  \ At one point, she goes \u201Ccan I apologize about something?\u201D and it had\
  \ been so long since all the racist comments, I basically forgot about all that\
  \ stuff. I had no idea what she was going to say, but she brought it up, and she\
  \ said that was really uncool of her to say, and she has felt awful ever since.\
  \ She said she\u2019s changed and she definitely knows better now, and all the comments\
  \ she made about brown people were misguided. I didn\u2019t say anything because\
  \ I was so surprised, and she kept talking saying that she knows Indians aren\u2019\
  t terrorists, etc, and to my complete embarrassment, I broke out into tears. Full\
  \ on sobs. Could not get a word out and couldn\u2019t control myself. I have no\
  \ explanation. I did not think her words affected me that much. \n\nShe was a lot\
  \ more embarrassed now, and was saying she was sorry for making me cry. I was embarrassed\
  \ for crying, so I got up to leave and basically said, \u201CIt was a nice chat,\
  \ I need to go now.\u201D She said she\u2019d walk me to my car, and I snapped at\
  \ her, \u201CNo! Please leave me alone.\u201D\n\nI got into my car, still crying,\
  \ and halfway home I started cracking up over how ridiculous the whole thing was.\
  \ WHY AM I CRYING? I HAVE NO IDEA. I\u2019ve felt bad about how I reacted since.\
  \ She grew up, acknowledged that she did wrong, and I totally flipped out on her\
  \ for no reason. Oops?"
