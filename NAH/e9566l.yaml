selftext: "English is not my first language, mobile, etc\n\nSome background: My grandfather\\\
  [85M\\]  has been a very vocal vegetarian for most of his live. He hasn't eaten\
  \ meat inover  60 years, he brought up all his children as vegetarians and was very\
  \ involved in the vegetarian community. He often talked to us grandchildren about\
  \ the abuse animals suffered in the meat indusyry and how he could hardly stomach\
  \ it to see people he loved eating animals.  Eventhough not all of my cousins are\
  \ still vegetarians, we would always tell him we were, as to not hurt him. \n\n\
  The situation now is that my grandfather has been living in a home for the last\
  \ three years as he has been developing dementia. They can cater vegetarian food,\
  \ and this was fine. But as his dementia is getting worse, his is starting to want\
  \ to eat meat, and does not understand why he can't. This is going as far as trying\
  \ to grab the sausages of the other patients plate, which of course causes quite\
  \ a bit of problems in the home. This has been going on for about 3 months I would\
  \ say. So, the nurses have asked us to switch his food to the normal diet with meat\
  \ included. I am inclined to allow this.\n\nTo add more info: I \\[25F\\] am the\
  \ person that has the most contact with the staff, because I'm also in a medical\
  \ field, my family prefers I deal with the doctors appointments. I'm the first person\
  \ they contact and the one that makes the decisions officialy. My grandma died years\
  \ ago. My mom and aunt (his only two living children) are both vehemently against\
  \ letting my grandfather eat meat, because it would hurt him, as he lived his life\
  \ as a vegetarian. They are very passionate about not eating meat themselves. My\
  \ mom has told me that she would never want me to allow this for her even if she\
  \ develops dementia, as is sure my grandfather feels the same, but we never discussed\
  \ this with him when he wasn't ill. She thinks the staff is mainly asking because\
  \ he is causing troubles at the meals, and does not think is a good enough reason\
  \ to go against his life-long ideas.   \nI however, think that what my grandfather\
  \ wants n\xF3w matters as well, even if he has dementia. Realistically he only has\
  \ at best a couple more years to live, and why not let him be as happy as possible\
  \ in these?"
