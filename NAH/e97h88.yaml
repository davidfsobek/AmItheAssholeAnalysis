selftext: "Title sounds bad, please hear me out.\n\nWife and I have been together\
  \ for nearly a decade. I just recently landed a cushy 9-5 desk job and I am still\
  \ in the probationary period. My wife works from home. She is unable to drive so\
  \ we only have one car, however this is not usually an issue because we live in\
  \ a big city and public transportation is readily available, so my wife can get\
  \ around if need be.\n\nOur dog was a 100lb Great Pyrenees and hands down the best\
  \ dog I have ever met. He was a gentle giant. Sweet and cuddly but protective of\
  \ his home and family. My wife and I both loved this dog immensely.\n\nOn Monday\
  \ morning I got a call from my wife and she was in hysterics. Our dog passed away\
  \ unexpectedly between the time I left for work and the time she woke up. It was\
  \ absolutely heartbreaking. After the initial shock, she begged me to come home\
  \ so we could take his body to the vet and have him cremated. She obviously couldn\u2019\
  t because 1) she can\u2019t move him by herself and 2) she can\u2019t take him on\
  \ public transportation anyways. She also obviously wanted comfort.\n\nSince I\u2019\
  m still in the probationary period of my job, I risked getting terminated if I left\
  \ work. Their attendance policy during this period is extremely strict. I talked\
  \ to my boss about the situation and he confirmed that it would not look good on\
  \ me to leave and pretty much said no. Money is tight right now and every dollar\
  \ counts for us.\n\nI told my wife I couldn\u2019t come home and she was extremely\
  \ upset about it. I told her to cover him with a towel or sheet and we would go\
  \ when I got home, but she didn\u2019t want to leave the body in our home for hours.\
  \ She ended up getting a neighbor to drive her to get our dog cremated and I\u2019\
  m really upset I wasn\u2019t there to say goodbye to our dog and that she didn\u2019\
  t wait for me.\n\nWe\u2019re now upset with each other and I\u2019m left wondering\
  \ if I\u2019m the asshole here. AITA Reddit?"
