selftext: "I am a medical patient living in a legalized state. So from a legal perspective\
  \ I\u2019m literally as safe as I can be as a weed smoker. \n\nI smoke to decrease\
  \ my bloating. It\u2019s quite severe, has been my whole life. Weed INSTANTLY (within\
  \ 3 seconds) stops me from feeling the bloat. So here\u2019s how I am when I smoke\
  \ weed: \n\n- i almost always smoke just enough to make my body feel better, but\
  \ not enough for it to affect my head much. I frequently do a lot of higher brain\
  \ power things while high (including peer editing her essays)\n\n- I have never\
  \ once neglected my girlfriend, made her feel like I\u2019m not present, make her\
  \ feel like I\u2019m lazy, etc. I have confirmed this with her. In the house, I\
  \ take care of most chores and all cooking. \n\n- I have never allowed weed to affect\
  \ my job or safety driving. \n\n- I have never allowed weed to be a financial problem.\
  \ I make over 6 figures and I use less than $1000 of weed per year. We have no kids.\
  \ \n\n- I spend basically 100% of my free time after work with my girlfriend or\
  \ doing housework like cooking or cleaning. Again she never feels like I\u2019m\
  \ not present or any less of a boyfriend for her. I am usually slightly high throughout\
  \ this whole period. \n\n- she cannot tell the difference between me slightly high\
  \ and me not high. She can tell the difference when I\u2019m slightly more than\
  \ slightly high, but she says it\u2019s cute. \n\n- I have never once gotten \u201C\
  too high\u201D for her except during deliberate sessions where she\u2019s joining\
  \ me (in which case she\u2019s totally fine with it of course) \n\nSo yeah those\
  \ are all the factors. She is worried for me, worried for long term effects. She\
  \ admits herself she doesn\u2019t have a true reason for me to stop, except that\
  \ me doing weed all the time scared her about the future. \n\nFor me it\u2019s just\
  \ difficult to say no. I spend every day choosing between feeling like my stomach\
  \ is an asshole, and smoking a bit of weed. And knowing all those factors above,\
  \ it\u2019s hard for me to say no. And I know the potential long term side effects\
  \ are controversial at best, but personally I\u2019m not worried about the risk.\
  \ I used to drink daily and now I don\u2019t so it\u2019s definitely an improvement.\
  \ I mean, would you quit on a vice that doesn\u2019t impact your family life, helps\
  \ your issues, and doesn\u2019t have any major proven negative long term effects?\n\
  \nBtw she has not been mean about this. She brings it up as a concern but not as\
  \ an argumentative thing. If there\u2019s any judgment it shouldn\u2019t be ESH\
  \ cus she\u2019s great."
