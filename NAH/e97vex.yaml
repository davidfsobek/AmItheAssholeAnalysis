selftext: "  \n\nI\u2019m 30M. My friend Sarah, who this is about, is 29F. We\u2019\
  re both happily married, we know the other\u2019s spouse and all get on great.\n\
  \nMe, Sarah and another friend (Jane, 29F) met for lunch last weekend. We\u2019\
  ve all been close friends since high school. \n\nJane was telling us about a guy\
  \ she was dating who was the jealous type e.g. Jane and I went to dinner a few weeks\
  \ ago to catch up (which we do once or twice a year) and that guy had a huge problem\
  \ with it \u2013 he said it is weird and inappropriate for us to have gone to dinner\
  \ alone, especially because I\u2019m married. Jane doesn\u2019t think that way and\
  \ they stopped dating for this and other reasons.\n\nPersonally, I hate jealous\
  \ or controlling behaviour. In my opinion people cheat because they suck, not because\
  \ they keep themselves/their spouse away from temptation or whatever. If anything,\
  \ being on the receiving end of controlling/jealous behaviour is probably why some\
  \ people cheat.\n\nAnyway\u2026 below summarises the conversation Sarah and I had\
  \ in response to Jane\u2019s situation:\n\nMe : That guy is ridiculous, we\u2019\
  re adults and have been friends for years. It doesn\u2019t matter whether I\u2019\
  m married or not, he is just jealous and insecure. People like that need to get\
  \ a grip and grow up. \n\nSarah : He isn\u2019t exactly wrong. Someone is more likely\
  \ to cheat with someone they\u2019re already friends with and close to. What's wrong\
  \ with meeting as a group, or bringing their husband/wife/girlfriend/boyfriend along?\
  \ I wouldn\u2019t meet up with you or any guy without someone else being there.\
  \ \n\n(I only now realise that we have never ever seen each other outside school\
  \ one-on-one, it was always in a group setting which I never thought anything of)\n\
  \nMe : I can\u2019t believe after 15 years of friendship you think it would be weird\
  \ for us to meet away from our spouses. You either don't trust me, your husband,\
  \ or his friends. You are being jealous and ridiculous.\n\nSarah : I\u2019m not\
  \ jealous and I'm not ridiculous, I\u2019m respectful of normal relationship boundaries.\
  \ I wouldn\u2019t want my husband to meet his female friends alone and I wouldn\u2019\
  t do that to him either, so there\u2019s no issue. \n\nThe rest of the lunch was\
  \ really awkward. Sarah told Jane afterwards she felt that I was harsh and wrong,\
  \ and her relationship with her husband is none of my business. \n\nMy wife also\
  \ thinks Sarah is ridiculous, but also thinks I should have let it go and not commented\
  \ further, it isn\u2019t my business what boundaries other couples have. \n\nJane\
  \ thinks Sarah\u2019s opinion is ridiculous too, but doesn\u2019t think I was right\
  \ or wrong. I have no idea what Sarah\u2019s husband thinks.\n\nI don\u2019t believe\
  \ my handling of the situation was bad, but I\u2019m in doubt which is why I\u2019\
  m asking here. \n\nSo\u2026 AITA? \n\n   \x02"
