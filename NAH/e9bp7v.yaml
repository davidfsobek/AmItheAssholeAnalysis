selftext: "Hello. Throwaway for obvious reasons. \n\nLittle bit of backstory; My best\
  \ friend and I have been so close for around 10 years now. I am a cis, heterosexual\
  \ female, and he has recently come out to me as trans (which I welcomed; I\u2019\
  ll always support him) \n\nWell, here\u2019s the issue: I\u2019m very affectionate\
  \ (hugs and such) with my female friends, however, I feel very awkward being affectionate\
  \ with my male friends. I\u2019m not sure why, but I always have been. And I love\
  \ this friend to bits, but something about him being male makes me slightly less\
  \ comfortable with being affectionate to him. I\u2019m only really posting here\
  \ because I really don\u2019t want to offend or hurt my friend; I wouldn\u2019t\
  \ have made it this far in life without them; but I really want help from an outside\
  \ POV. WIBTA?"
