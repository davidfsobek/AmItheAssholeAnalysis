selftext: "A few years ago in university I was very casually sleeping with a woman\
  \ who was an acquaintance with my sister. \n\nMy sister was in a wedding a couple\
  \ of weeks ago and saw this this woman for the first time since 2014 as she was\
  \ there. She heard from people she has a daughter and my sister saw her briefly\
  \ in the lobby with her and the family resemblance was uncanny with us. \n\nMy sister\
  \ did some sleuthing and she lives several hours away back in her home town and\
  \ seems really happy. The birthdate of the child who is now 4.5 would have meant\
  \ the child was conceived when we were casually seeing each other. She found some\
  \ comments she made in a local mother's community saying things like how she chose\
  \ not to involve the father of her daughter so she could move and travel with her\
  \ freely, didn't have to answer to anyone else, could make decisions for her child\
  \ entirely on her own, and didn't have to be \"tied to someone in a different region\
  \ I was only casually involved with\" and because in the future, if she meets someone,\
  \ they can be a family without \"interference\".  She writes she rathers being a\
  \ single mom than having to \"deal with bay daddy drama and I'm lucky I can afford\
  \ to not need child support\".\n\nI know her family is very wealthy, and she will\
  \ not be lacking for money at all, hence why she could afford to make this decision.\
  \  \n\nMy sister said I should contact her, but it is up to me and she won't get\
  \ involved, especially because she knows she is fine financially. \n\nI have decided\
  \ to keep my mouth shut. Firstly, it is clearly what she wants and I'll respect,\
  \ but also secondly, I feel relieved she has \"let me off the hook\" when most dudes\
  \ are not that lucky and don't want to go poke the bear and end up getting myself\
  \ on the hook for 14+ years of child support and and expectation I'll play daddy\
  \ to a kid. My sister asked about medical history and if she ever needs blood or\
  \ bone marrow, and I said that the mother can always contact me if and when that\
  \ situation arises if she needs to. \n\nIn our country (not the US), you are not\
  \ held responsible for child support if you did not know about the child, so there\
  \ is no risk she can hit me with a bill, and she'd have had to sign an offical sworn\
  \ legal document (sorry, not sure how you say that in English) saying she honestly\
  \ does not know the father to be able to register the birth without my name and\
  \ then she could be punished for lying on the document. \n\nAITA?\n\nEdit because\
  \ I forgot to mention: she never even hinted she might be pregnant. She just blocked\
  \ me off social media and ghosted me one day. I didn't press it figuring it would\
  \ be weird and creepy, and I wasn't *that* into her that I was particularly devastated.\
  \ So obviously, no idea the child could exist."
