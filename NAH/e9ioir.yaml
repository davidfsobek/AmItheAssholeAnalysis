selftext: "Prof did a \u201Cquiz\u201D that was more like a mini test. I studied for\
  \ it, made flash cards, and I was prepared for the quiz. Apparently other people\
  \ weren\u2019t, because they all complained of getting low grades on the quiz. I\
  \ did well, but the average was really low. Prof said, to loud cheers, that he would\
  \ throw out this quiz grade and give everyone a \u201Csecond chance\u201D next week.\
  \ I approached him after class and said I thought this was unfair to those of us\
  \ who\u2019d studied for it. He said that if I did well on the first one I can study\
  \ again and do well on the second one. But I already studied and took the quiz,\
  \ I don\u2019t want to do it again. \n\nI\u2019m considering bringing it up again,\
  \ but I know that asking about it has the effect of screwing the rest of the class\
  \ over. I get it but at the same time, they all knew about the quiz and had the\
  \ same opportunity to study for it as I did. \n\nAITA?"
