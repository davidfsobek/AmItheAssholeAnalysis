selftext: "Recently it was discovered that a tumor the size of a golf ball has been\
  \ growing inside the front of my brain, pushing against my skull. I found out this\
  \ was the cause of my increasing headaches over the past few years, my inability\
  \ to concentrate and my poor decision making. After I had a seizure and collapsed\
  \ at work it was all discovered and I was put on the waiting list for surgery.\n\
  \nSo many people have come out of the woodwork to wish me well and act nice to me\
  \ - for example former friends who didn\u2019t invite me to their weddings I think\
  \ are just making token gestures and I don\u2019t really have the time or patience\
  \ for it. Ex-girlfriends, people I hardly know from work - it\u2019s just all too\
  \ much for me. I\u2019m being operated on just after the new year and there\u2019\
  s a 50-60% chance I won\u2019t make it through the surgery. If I don\u2019t have\
  \ the surgery it\u2019ll get much worse so I\u2019ve come to terms with what needs\
  \ to happen and what *may* happen if I opted out of surgery. I don\u2019t think\
  \ I feel scared anymore.\n\nThe thing is, I don\u2019t want all these former \u201C\
  friends\u201D or acquaintances from work or any of my exes to attend my funeral\
  \ if I don\u2019t pull through. I have my family and a couple of close friends and\
  \ they\u2019re the only people I\u2019d want there, though my sister thinks I\u2019\
  m being unreasonable and that I should allow everyone who might want to pay respects\
  \ and celebrate my life to attend."
