selftext: "I'm a binger. Whether it's TV, Movie series, Games, or, in this case, Books;\
  \ if it's something that I find interesting and enjoyable than chances are I'm going\
  \ to keep enjoying and being interested in it until I finish it. My wife is *not*\
  \ a binger. She will drop things for a while and then pick them up later and enjoy\
  \ it just the same as if she never stopped reading it\n\nWell, I got her into [Worm](https://parahumans.wordpress.com/2011/06/11/1-1/),\
  \ which if you haven't heard of it is a web-serial about supervillains and superheroes...\
  \ It also quickly became my ***FAVORITE BOOK/SERIES EVER!*** I could gush about\
  \ it for hours, but there's a 3000 character limit so if you are looking for a book\
  \ it's free and it's great, I recommend it\n\nIt's also ***long as shit***, clocking\
  \ in at just below 1.7 *million* words... That's all of Harry Potter, and then again\
  \ until halfway through *Order of the Pheonix*\n\nSo I naturally outpaced her for\
  \ the first while, but I always made sure to stop at points to allow her to catch\
  \ up! But then,  she just stopped. She wanted to take a break from it, which is\
  \ fine! I didn't mind putting it on hold for a while\n\nAnd she *never* picked it\
  \ back up. So after a few weeks I started asking her if she'd be willing to pick\
  \ it back up. And she said \"*Oh, yeah, sure! I was going to anyway!*\". But she\
  \ didn't, and months passed. I would even later ask if she'd read an Arc as a gift\
  \ to me for my birthday and she said she would (she didn't)\n\nSo... I restarted\
  \ the book, making sure to take it in small chunks to slow my pace and give her\
  \ some more time. After a bit, I had caught up to where I was before, and she still\
  \ wasn't budging... and then I finished it. \n\nAnd then I *reread it in it's entirety\
  \ because it was just that* ***fucking*** *good*!!!\n\nBut then, afterwards, I mentioned\
  \ something in reference to some things that happen later on, (not a spoiler or\
  \ anything, just something that made it apparent I knew about future events) and\
  \ my wife got quite upset at me. We were reading it together after all, and she\
  \ was upset that I\\~\n\n1. didn't wait for her so we could go through it together\
  \ and\n2. didn't tell her I was continuing without her until after I had already\
  \ started...\n\nAnd she says that her ability to enjoy it has now been compromised\
  \ because it's no longer *our* book, and me knowing what will happen will stress\
  \ her out because I don't give spoilers... Oh, and also, she doesn't know I'm actually\
  \ *done*, she just knows that I continued reading it so that will be an issue when\
  \ it comes up\n\nPersonally, I feel like there should be a limit on putting pauses\
  \ on things like books or shows. I put it down for months and months with no sign\
  \ of it getting started back up, I can't be expected to wait forever to continue\
  \ something I love, can I?\n\nSo, AITA for reading the book behind my wife's back?\
  \ And as a bonus, would I be justified in telling her that I finished it because\
  \ I was sick of waiting for her to start it back up?"
