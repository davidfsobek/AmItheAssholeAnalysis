selftext: "I have aspergers, and along with it hyperosmia. I am very sensitive to\
  \ smells such as exhaust, perfume, most soap smells, cigarette, etc. This has caused\
  \ me a lot of problems functioning in life.\n\nHolding my breath when walking past\
  \ people using perfume, avoiding areas with cars. Not going into the bathroom when\
  \ my mother has been there (because of perfume). Not leaving my room for some hours\
  \ if someone has used a perfume or hair spray outside the bathroom. The list goes\
  \ on.\n\nMy parents argue that everyone else in the world can't change their life\
  \ to suit me. And I finally took that to heart, and bought a respirator mask a month\
  \ back. A pretty expensive one which filters out all sorts of smells. I wear it\
  \ while going to the city, while shopping for groceries, and when there are strong\
  \ smells at home.\n\nIt has been obvious that neither of my parents are happy about\
  \ it. Throwing out small comments like \"Are you really wearing that?\", \"You are\
  \ going out looking like that?\", \"Aren't you embarrassed to be seen like that?\"\
  \n\nAnd today my parents exploded at me. I was going up for breakfast today (We\
  \ live in a pretty small, but 3 story house), when I reached the second floor I\
  \ was met with a wall of hairspray smell, so I turned around and got the mask. When\
  \ I arrived at the top floor with the kitchen, I was yelled at by my mother. Telling\
  \ me I was being very rude for wearing the mask inside, and my father told me that\
  \ he was embarrassed to be seen with me while walking outside.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAITA\
  \ for using it? I thought I was trying to find a solution to a problem I couldn't\
  \ expect other people to solve for me, but I am not very good at knowing social\
  \ ques, or norms, so maybe I am really messing up.\n\nThis is in Norway btw.\n\n\

  \ This is the mask I bought. Correct term for it is Respirator mask I think. I looked\
  \ into those paper masks popular in Asian countries, but I was under the impression\
  \ that it does not filter out any smells, just dust.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 2: Thanks\
  \ everyone. I read through every comment, and I appreciate the answers, as well\
  \ as all the other people with similar issues clarifying things for people. Which\
  \ I should do a bit of too.\n\nFirst of all, I see the comments suggesting I try\
  \ other more discrete masks like Cambridge, and after doing some research, it seems\
  \ they do block most smells, but some commenters here claim they don't.. I will\
  \ try and see if I can get this somewhere locally in Norway. The options online\
  \ seem to be very pricy with shipping (in addition, after 1st of January, a flat\
  \ 25% tax will be added on all online shopping from outside Norway, yay!) \n\nI\
  \ should also clarify that I don't wear this all the time. Our house is at the foot\
  \ of a mountain, near a forest, and the air is clear and refreshing, I have the\
  \ windows open year round so the room smells great. My mother do not use perfume\
  \ all the time. She does try and accommodate by not using perfume or hairspray,\
  \ at least not in a common area. But it doesn't take too much for her to decide\
  \ to do it anyways. Being in a hurry, meeting, going to a party, etc. In the incident\
  \ today (yesterday now) she was getting ready for a meeting. \n\nI live about 3km\
  \ from the city centre. The path there is mostly through some of the richer parts\
  \ of the town. So most people have electric cars, and I rarely meet people on the\
  \ way. It only becomes a problem once I reach the city centre. With shopping centres,\
  \ pubs, caf\xE9s, fastfood, etc. That is when I have to put on the mask. I still\
  \ try and use it as little as possible (mostly because it is expensive and I don't\
  \ want to waste it), so I will take it off if I can."
