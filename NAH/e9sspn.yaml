selftext: "My wife is Finnish and she\u2019s a pediatrician. Growing up, she didn\u2019\
  t have homework. That\u2019s just not how they do things over there, to my understanding.\
  \ \n\n\nOur kids are 7 and 5. The 5yo doesn\u2019t have homework but the 7yo does\
  \ and honestly, it seems like a lot. \n\n\nMy wife is firm on the stance that he\
  \ does not HAVE to do the homework. We make him read nightly(which is part of the\
  \ homework) and we make him do big projects but that worksheet stuff? Nope. \n\n\
  \n\nShe doesn\u2019t agree with giving kids his age homework and tells our kids\
  \ to tell the teacher we were too busy if she gives him trouble. So far, it hasn\u2019\
  t even been mentioned that he doesn\u2019t do it and he has good grades. \n\n\n\
  But a part of me gets a little anxious every Friday afternoon because i think he\u2019\
  ll come home with a nasty note from his teacher about his lack of homework for the\
  \ week. \n\n\n\nHe doesn\u2019t seem to have any anxiety about it nor does my wife\
  \ obviously. So I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s unfounded anxiety or not. \n\n\n\n\
  We\u2019ve talked about it and she told him he\u2019ll have to start doing it when\
  \ he\u2019s in 4th or 5th grade but right now we don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate.\
  \ \n\n\n\nI feel like his teacher secretly thinks we are assholes though. What do\
  \ you say, reddit?"
