selftext: "We have a 5 year old and we are foster parents. A few months ago, one of\
  \ our FKs got reunited with her family. \n\n\nIt was a gradual process and we did\
  \ our best to prepare everyone but our 5yo still didn\u2019t quite get it. She was\
  \ just barely 4 when that FK was placed with us. She was our first placement. \n\
  \n\nDropping her off with her family was very hard for everyone. She shut down at\
  \ first then went in to full blown hysterics when she realized we were really leaving.\
  \ It got to the point where i has to pry her off me and her mom had to hold her\
  \ back. We didn\u2019t bring 5yo with us to drop FK off.\n\n\n\nOur 5yo just didn\u2019\
  t seem to grasp that FK wouldn\u2019t live with us anymore. She kept asking about\
  \ her and trying to negotiate ways to make her come back. Sometimes she\u2019d get\
  \ very upset with us for \u201Cnot letting\u201D FK live with us anymore.\n\n\n\n\
  We have another FK who will be reuniting with their family on the 21st. Part of\
  \ me is thinking we should bring 5yo so she has a better understanding of this is\
  \ it, FKs have to go back to their other home. It didn\u2019t seem like FK grasped\
  \ the situation until she got there so I think it will help 5yo grasp it by being\
  \ there. \n\n\n\nMy mom, who was also a foster parent, doesn\u2019t think it\u2019\
  s a good idea and says it\u2019s too traumatic to expose our 5yo to."
