selftext: "Some background info:  My boyfriend has a condition that he has to take\
  \ testosterone shots and for as long as we have been dating, i have had a hard time\
  \ with our sex life because he takes a long time to get off ( 45 min sometimes).\
  \  I was so used to men being able to get the job done in about 20 min before that\
  \ I no longer really like being intimate very much because going for a lot longer\
  \ stresses me out and doesnt feel good.  \n\n  We recently got into a fight about\
  \ how we dont have enough sex and i sent an article about how the average time is\
  \ around 15-25 min for people.   I have read may articles like this, but he refuses\
  \ to see that im not just being selfish.  He says he wants more foreplay and I just\
  \ have never really had to do that for a guy before. I want to make him happy because\
  \ i love him, but am i an asshole for sending him data that shows the amt of time\
  \ he takes would be stressful for a lot of people?\n\nTo add a bit more perspective\
  \ I'm adding this too:\n\nThe thing is, I sent the article because he thinks it's\
  \ all just me. Thst women should like sex for long periods of time. I just wanted\
  \ him to know I'm not abnormal for not liking it that long. I wasnt sending it to\
  \ be cruel. I can see how it might seem that way though. Honestly it's just stressful\
  \ all around. \n\nPeople suggest that I ought to try foreplay and I agree, but I\
  \ also try other things too. I try positions he likes, I sext him, I talk dirty,\
  \ I ask what fantasies he has, I am affectionate etc..      if he would acknowledge\
  \ that he is part of the issue, I would be less frustrated and not feel the need\
  \ to prove to him that it's ok for me to not wsnt sex to last that long."
