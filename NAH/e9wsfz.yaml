selftext: "My aunt is in her late 70s. She\u2019s on dialysis three days a week. \n\
  \nMy uncle died a few days ago, he was the one driving her to dialysis and picking\
  \ her up. \n\nShe has no children. She is very stubborn and opinionated. She\u2019\
  s from the old world and is slightly racist. \n\nI offered to take care of her,\
  \ to live in my house and I will take her to dialysis and the rest of it. This is\
  \ despite the fact that she is not fun to hang out with.\n\nI live four hours away\
  \ in a much more affluent area and in a much bigger house.\n\nShe declined my invite\
  \ because her little shitwawa \u201Cdoes not like people\u201D. Are you fucking\
  \ kidding me?\n\nI am the only relative she has that is worth a damn.\n\nShe\u2019\
  s on a fixed income and I don\u2019t think anyone has the resources to take care\
  \ of her as well as I can.\n\nI told her that if she does not move in with me that\
  \ I will not be taking care of her anymore. \n\nAm I the asshole?\n\nEdit: I told\
  \ her that I will visit when I can but cannot be her main help or her emergency\
  \ contact. I\u2019m too far."
title: AITA For telling my aunt who just lost her husband that I will not be taking
  care of her unless she moves in with me.
