selftext: "My work is having their holiday party this Saturday and they just provided\
  \ the menu for the evening. For context, I work at an ad agency with about 70 people\
  \ in LA. \n\nWe're having the party at a nice restaurant in Hollywood and the menu\
  \ includes 12 different dishes including filet mignon, pan-seared salmon, truffle\
  \ mac and cheese, etc. Some pretty nice non-vegan options. \n\nThe one vegan option\
  \ is a kale salad. I think they could have offered at least one more dish that's\
  \ a main and vegan. I've already expressed this to our HR in the past about not\
  \ having options at these events and feel like they just don't care. As a result,\
  \ I'm annoyed.\n\nAm I the asshole for feeling this way?"
