selftext: "Backstory: My best friend and I made a pin business. At the beginning we\
  \ both were making designs, but as I started improving and my friend felt like she\
  \ wasn\u2019t good at it anymore, she started doing the \u201Cmanagement\u201D side\
  \ of the business while I did the \u201Cart design\u201D side. \n\nWe\u2019re pretty\
  \ successful now, but there are a few things that irk me:\n\n1) I spend hours, even\
  \ days, coming up with designs. While it takes less than 5 minutes for my friend\
  \ to post on the Instagram page. \n2) She has nothing she can contribute to the\
  \ Instagram, so when we are inactive she hits me up with a \u201Chey we\u2019ve\
  \ been inactive for a while, u got any designs I can post lol.\u201D Not to mention\
  \ all graphic designs and logos are done by me as well, so all she does is come\
  \ up with a caption and presses post. \n3) I took an accounting course to help better\
  \ my understanding on finances, but my friend is the one who is really anal about\
  \ the money. It feels like she has a strict hold of the money. I told her to take\
  \ an accounting class since she was so serious about it but said it wasn\u2019t\
  \ for her and it was too boring so she doesn\u2019t want to. \n4) She paces our\
  \ shop openings too slow but complains that we\u2019re inactive. Of course we\u2019\
  re inactive, because we release too many designs but not enough physical products.\
  \ How do you expect me to keep pumping out designs when we haven\u2019t even made\
  \ the physical pins of designs we already have? \n5) We were gone for a bit because\
  \ of school, and Instagram\u2019s algorithm changed in that time. We don\u2019t\
  \ have a lot of fan interactions like before. My designs don\u2019t get that many\
  \ likes as it use to and she hits me up with a \u201Cthe design didnt get a lot\
  \ of likes, I\u2019m embarrassed.\u201D Which really hurt me, because that\u2019\
  s my design that I worked really hard on, why are you embarrassed when you didn\u2019\
  t make the design.\n6) People always compliment \u201Cour\u201D designs and how\
  \ they look up to \u201Cus\u201D as an inspiration. When she sees those, she always\
  \ says \u201CIt\u2019s crazy how successful we are now. I use to want to quit because\
  \ of how little followers we had at the beginning.\u201D \n\nIt just feels like\
  \ I\u2019m doing a lot more than she is. I use to enjoy making designs but not anymore.\
  \ Not to mention, the money is being split 50/50. Which I was fine at the beginning\
  \ because we were BOTH making designs at first. Maybe I\u2019m just a control freak,\
  \ and I\u2019m selfish for wanting the success to myself. But I also feel under\
  \ appreciated and taken advantage of even though I know that wasn\u2019t her intentions.\
  \ I just wish we could go back to when we were doing equal work and both making\
  \ designs. \n\n\nWIBTA if I told her that I feel like I\u2019m contributing more\
  \ than her and that I feel like she\u2019s riding on the coattails of the success\
  \ of my designs?"

  \ of our business?"
