selftext: 'My fiance (28M) and I (28F) have been together for three years. When I
  was 18/19, I had just moved out of my parents'' house and was living independently
  in an apartment for the first time in my life. I enjoyed being naked inside my house
  at the time and I liked the freedom and the novelty of it, so I lived like that
  for a couple of years. After that, I moved to a new city and always lived with roommates/housemates,
  so I never got to do that again, for many many years. My fiance and I moved into
  a new apartment around five months ago, and I thought I could start being naked
  at home again, since I was living with an SO for the first time in my life and we
  had the apartment all to ourselves. I was apprehensive about it though, as I didn''t
  know how he would react. So instead of making it a permanent thing, I just tried
  it out a couple of times, just being naked at home when my fiance came home from
  work, or returned from a trip. He didn''t react that positively though, he claimed
  that it was weird and said "what is wrong with you, go put on some clothes".


  However, I enjoyed the experience of being naked at home, both when I was alone,
  and when I was with my fiance. I found it thrilling and enjoyable, as well as freeing
  and comfortable. So I explained to my fiance that I enjoyed being a nudist inside
  the house and wanted to try it out more often, maybe even make it a regular/usual
  thing. He became kinda upset and weirded out by the idea. He didn''t get angry or
  start shouting, but he accused me of ruining the novelty of sex, and that by making
  nudity regular, I am taking away the sensuality of our relationship. He said that
  being naked for a couple of minutes while changing was okay, but doing it as a regular
  thing would reduce the intimate nature of our relationship and harm our sex life.
  Isn''t he basically saying that my naked self is purely sexual and that my body
  serves no other purpose. He''s been behaving slightly weird and distant with me
  for the past two days. AITA here?'
