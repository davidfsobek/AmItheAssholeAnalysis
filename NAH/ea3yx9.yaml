selftext: "In context, my wife stays at home with the baby and I work full time. Most\
  \ nights we have a routine where I make the bottles and she feeds him. As he starts\
  \ to sleep more I've been making them and feeding him around 4-5. However, we got\
  \ a new bed and I haven't been sleeping to well and my job is picking up. So this\
  \ morning I admit, I was a little irritated. She woke up and asked me if I wanted\
  \ her to feed him, and I said yes just so I could get just a little more sleep.\
  \ Apparently this was the wrong answer as she got an attitude and got upset with\
  \ me. I told her I'd just do it. Eventually I gave in and gave her the baby, and\
  \ fell asleep. When i woke up she was back asleep, and still was when I left. \n\
  \nI get being a stay at home mom, especially to a new born is tough. I'm not knocking\
  \ it, because I dont think I could do it all that great. I try to give her alone\
  \ time when I get home and let her rest. It starts the moment when I get in the\
  \ door. I never get to rest or unwind after work. And I dont ask for it. I just\
  \ want a peaceful night of sleep, which I know is impossible at the moment. As I\
  \ said before, I usually just do it. I just didn't want to this morning."

  get a little more sleep before work..
