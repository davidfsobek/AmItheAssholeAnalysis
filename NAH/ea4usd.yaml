selftext: "So I have a very large dog about 100 lbs or so and a very tiny dog, about\
  \ 5 lbs. \n\nMy mother in law visits my wife about once a week she will come over.\
  \ Most times for several hours. \n\nMy MIL is not an animal person in the slightest\
  \ and especially not a dog person. \n\nHowever, she likes our 5 lb dog and sometimes\
  \ pets her or gives her some treats. But she is deathly afraid of my 100 lb dog,\
  \ on the sole fact that he\u2019s a big German shepherd.  \n\nI wouldn\u2019t have\
  \ a problem locking him up if she only visited once in a while, but it has been\
  \ at least once a week lately and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to my dog, especially\
  \ because he would never harm her. \n\nMy wife thinks I am being a bit rude to her\
  \ mother because I know how scared she of him. \n\nAITA for no longer keeping him\
  \ locked up in the bedroom when my MIL comes over?"
