selftext: "Hello reddit, I\u2019m making my first throwaway account (and my first\
  \ account in general) to get business advice from this sub (very sound, I know)\n\
  \nSO, my wife and I just opened our first restaurant (yay!), a very specific type\
  \ of African food in a pretty small city, which means 2 things: first, we are the\
  \ only restaurant of this cuisine in the city and second, we are EXTREMELY busy.\
  \ I know this is just a new restaurant phenomenon and the shine will wear off, but\
  \ we\u2019re always going to at least FEEL busy due to the fact that our location\
  \ is soooooo tiny. \nIf all goes well, we\u2019re thinking about a second location\
  \ or a relocation, but for now we have a tiny hole in the wall with 8 two tops (each\
  \ has a booth and chair side, meaning sometimes more people can squeeze on the booth\
  \ side) and a tiny counter for technically 5, but realistically 3 people. \n\nSo\
  \ far, this hasn\u2019t been too much of an issue, we can move tables around and\
  \ avoid overbooking by not booking at all (we don\u2019t accept reservations) but\
  \ since it\u2019s holiday season and families are in town, we\u2019ve been noticing\
  \ a lot of bigger parties. Last night we had to seat a party of 15, and while to\
  \ be fair 4 were small kids, as you may recall, we only have 8 tables technically\
  \ designed for 2! It took up literally half the restaurant, so the wife and I were\
  \ discussing limiting the size of parties we permit. Without fail, every large party\
  \ we\u2019ve had has apologized for bringing so many people not having realized\
  \ the size of the location, and a fair amount have left entirely after hearing the\
  \ wait they\u2019d have to face... \n\nI believe limiting the size of parties we\
  \ allow to 6, maybe 8, we can avoid these issues. Unfortunately for now, we aren\u2019\
  t built for big banquets or family reunions. my wife believes we shouldn\u2019t\
  \ turn anyone away as we aren\u2019t sure how long this initial boom will last,\
  \ and we aren\u2019t sure how this will reflect on us long term. I don\u2019t wanna\
  \ feel like I\u2019m punishing families, but I feel our space truly is extremely\
  \ limited. AITA?"
