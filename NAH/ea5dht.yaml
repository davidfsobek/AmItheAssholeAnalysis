selftext: "I've been dating my girlfriend for about a year now and have been talking\
  \ a lot about what we're looking for longterm. She's great and I can see a future\
  \ with her, but the one thing that holds me back is that she's a smoker. She smokes\
  \ probably half a pack of cigarettes a day. \n\nMy stepdad was a chronic smoker\
  \ when I was growing up and now that he's older, he has some serious health issues\
  \ related to it, and I'm worried that this will happen to her. The other thing is\
  \ that I have an excellent health care plan through my workplace that offers a significant\
  \ discount to non-smokers, and if we did get married and I added her to my health\
  \ insurance, the costs would go wayyyy up. I guess I'm not really thrilled about\
  \ having to pay thousands and thousands of extra dollars throughout my life for\
  \ something that's entirely avoidable.  \n\nGirlfriend thinks I'm being judgmental\
  \ and controlling because she's been smoking since before we started dating. But\
  \ I think dating someone is different than making a permanent legal commitment to\
  \ them and that I'm allowed to have dealbreakers when it comes to choosing a lifelong\
  \ partner. \n\nI understand that smoking is a really hard habit to quit and I would\
  \ absolutely be willing to do whatever I could to help and support her. AITA?"
