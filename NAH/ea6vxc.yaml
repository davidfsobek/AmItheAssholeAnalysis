  \ come to realize that my mother's cooking is objectively bad. I don't think weve\
  \ ever had a turkey that hasnt been dry for example. The meat is always overcooked\
  \ because that's how she grew up cooking it. Things like that.\n\nIve learned to\
  \ really enjoy cooking for myself and friends, and have become pretty good at it.\
  \ I occasionally cook for my family, and everyone really likes it. \n\nI've brought\
  \ up the idea a lot and most people are okay with it, but my mom doesn't really\
  \ like it. Maybe she feels like she's not useful or something idk"
