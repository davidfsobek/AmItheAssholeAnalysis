selftext: "My wife is a very impulsive and decisive person, and her pregnancy (5 months\
  \ along) hasn\u2019t made that any better. She recently decided she wants a dog,\
  \ and by recently I mean there was literally no mention of one before maybe 2 weeks\
  \ ago tops. \n\nLast night, I got  home and she ran over to me to show me a dog\
  \ she found at a nearby shelter, that she made an appointment to go meet it on my\
  \ next day off and asking me if I think we should change it\u2019s name. Maybe I\
  \ was a little off with my reaction because I was tired, but I kinda laughed and\
  \ said \u201Cwhy would I get you a dog when I already got you this?\u201D and put\
  \ my hand on her belly. I know it was in poor taste but it was clearly in good fun.\
  \ She slapped my hand away, called me an asshole and started crying, hard. \n\n\
  We\u2019ve had a discussion since and she seems ok, but was this a bad move on my\
  \ end?"
