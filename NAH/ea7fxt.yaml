selftext: "My boyfriend and I got an invitation in the mail to his aunt\u2019s holiday\
  \ dinner party. I had never met her before, but he said she was pretty wealthy and\
  \ old-fashioned, and I wanted to make a good impression. I said we should bring\
  \ a side dish to be polite, and my boyfriend insisted that wasn\u2019t necessary,\
  \ but I thought it was standard to bring something for the host, so I made a large\
  \ bowl of macaroni salad to share with everyone.\n\nWe arrived at his aunt\u2019\
  s house and she seemed a little weirded out when I gave her the macaroni salad but\
  \ thanked us and went to put it in the fridge. We were the first people to arrive,\
  \ and I started to get a little nervous when I saw that nobody else had brought\
  \ anything. And then we went to the dining room \u2026 and there was a set menu\
  \ on all of the plates, and it was all fancy food like scallops in white wine sauce.\n\
  \nHis aunt never took the macaroni salad out of the fridge during the dinner, and\
  \ I was too embarrassed to ask about it. I don\u2019t know what she did with it,\
  \ maybe she threw it out after we left.\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure I made a massive\
  \ faux pas, and I can\u2019t stop thinking about it. AITA?\n\nEdit: Thanks for all\
  \ of the helpful feedback/advice, I definitely won't make the same mistake next\
  \ time lol. The thank you note sounds like a really great idea, I'll be sure to\
  \ write one and mail it to her."
