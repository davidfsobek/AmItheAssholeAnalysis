selftext: "Yesterday my friend Rita posted on Facebook that she found out the guy\
  \ she was seeing for a few months actually had a girlfriend the entire time. She\
  \ asked for opinions about whether she should tell the girlfriend or just walk away\
  \ from the situation without further action. Most of the comments were telling her\
  \ that it wasn\u2019t worth it to get involved and that telling the girlfriend would\
  \ only make more trouble in her own life. \n\nI disagreed with the group and thought\
  \ that this woman deserved to know she\u2019s being cheated on. I sent Rita a message\
  \ telling her that if she was afraid to contact the girlfriend, she could give me\
  \ her contact information and I would let her know myself. What ended up happening\
  \ is that Rita wrote a \u201Cletter\u201D explaining the situation, and I emailed\
  \ it to this woman letting her know that I was contacting her on behalf of a friend\
  \ who wishes to remain anonymous.\n\nI\u2019ve since been seeing more comments on\
  \ Rita\u2019s post talking about how it\u2019s cruel to inform the girlfriend of\
  \ the situation this close to the holidays, how we\u2019re just creating more drama\
  \ for her when she probably already knows something is suspicious in her relationship,\
  \ etc. I\u2019m starting to question if I was too quick to jump in, and if maybe\
  \ it\u2019s more hurtful for her to hear this from me as a complete stranger that\
  \ really doesn\u2019t have a horse in this race. Am I the asshole?\n\n**tl;dr**:\
  \ Friend found out she was the other woman and was afraid to tell the girlfriend,\
  \ so I offered to pass the information along to her instead."
