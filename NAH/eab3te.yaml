selftext: "A little background - I live with my best friend's family as pretty much\
  \ another family member. This family is Jewish. My room is in the basement away\
  \ from pretty much everything. Yesterday I asked if I could put up a small tabletop\
  \ Christmas tree that my mom purchased for me. It's around a foot tall. When asking,\
  \ my friend's mom said she was fine with it. She said, however, that she would have\
  \ to talk to my friend's dad. I said that I hoped that he would respect my desire\
  \ to practice my tradition. End of conversation. \n\nThe next day, my friend's mom\
  \ said that I had hurt her feelings. She said that when I said that I am entitled\
  \ to practice my religion (not really what I said) I had disrespected her. I apologized\
  \ for hurting her feelings, and I tried to explain that I didn't mean that. I ended\
  \ up telling her that it's not a big deal to me to put up the Christmas tree and\
  \ that we could just forget about it. \n\nI try really hard to respect their religion.\
  \ I participate in a lot of their holidays as well. But when it comes to my traditions,\
  \ they don't seem to be allowed in the household, even small decorations. I am not\
  \ sure how to feel about this.\n\nEDIT: I wanted to put the tree up in my room,\
  \ away from everyone. I sleep in the basement so while it's not totally privately,\
  \ hardly anybody goes down here. Also, some people have asked if I pay rent, the\
  \ answer is no. Also, my friend's mom told me that having the Christmas tree in\
  \ my room made her uncomfortable, which is why I decided not to put it up."
