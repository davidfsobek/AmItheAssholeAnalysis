selftext: "My wife is an awesome woman, dedicated mother, with a great sense of fair\
  \ play, and I love her dearly.  She is also very sensitive to our baby (7mo) crying\
  \ and will hold him for hours until he falls asleep.  She enjoys the bonding, and\
  \ doesn't like the crying.  I, on the other hand, don't have time for that, choosing\
  \ to spend most of my waking, nonworking hours with baybo.  So when it's my turn\
  \ to put the l'il guy down, I set the baby down in his crib at bed time.  He sometimes\
  \ goes to sleep right away, but more often than not, he cries.  If so, I pick him\
  \ up and hold him for 5 minutes, then set him down again.  Often, he'll be ready\
  \ to sleep at this point, but if not, I let him cry for exactly 5 minutes before\
  \ picking him up again for 5 more and setting him down a third time.   Theoretically,\
  \ I'd repeat this indefinitely, but he (almost) always has gone to sleep right after\
  \ the third time setting him down.  I'm usually out  of there in \\~20 minutes.\n\
  \nThing is, the crying \\*really\\* bothers my wife.  She used to barge in regularly\
  \ and \"rescue\" the baby, and it got so bad that if I even heard her walking in\
  \ the hallway I'd feel a rush of irritation at the incoming challenge to my practical\
  \ fatherly methods.  I finally insisted she stop, and let me do my nights my way.\
  \ She got so upset she felt she had to leave the house. Mama bear is very protective,\
  \ even when her head tells her there is no threat.\n\nI don't really know what a\
  \ \"normal\" amount of clingyness is for a 7mo old, but boyo wails almost any time\
  \ you set him down, day or night.  I'm really OK with the yowling (sorry, Daddy\
  \ has to eat breakfast and shower at some point, kiddo).  While I of course don't\
  \ like that it seems to stress my wife out, I think it will get harder and harder\
  \ for him to self-comfort if I were to give up on this mild (and quite effective)\
  \ sleep training entirely.\n\nIt occurs to me that if this is the biggest issue\
  \ with our family, I'm a lucky man indeed, but truly, AITA?  \n\n\nUPDATE: thanks\
  \ all for weighing in.  The best and most consistent feedback I've gotten here is\
  \ that, whatever we decide, my wife and I need to get on the same page for consistency,\
  \ so I've decided to bring it up again this weekend instead of waiting a bit longer."
