selftext: "Background: I\u2019m female and both me and my SO are in our 20\u2019s.\
  \ Long distance for over a year now, but dating for 2.  We have sat down and talked\
  \ about getting married and everything so I\u2019m planning on staying with him.\n\
  \n\nI\u2019ve never had any previous boyfriend call my mum \u201Cmum\u201D. They\u2019\
  ve always called her by her name, I feel a little uncomfortable with my SO calling\
  \ her mum as I would never call his by mum always by her name and same thing with\
  \ his dad. I plan to stay with my SO and eventually yes she would be his mother\
  \ in law but still, hearing him call her that is weird to me.\n\nWIBTA if I asked\
  \ him to stop calling her mum and call her by her name?"
