selftext: "\nMy girlfriend and I found out she was pregnant. After thinking over things\
  \ we decided that we\u2019re going to raise it together. My gf and I thought the\
  \ best thing would be for her to move into my place since she currently shares hers\
  \ 2 other roommates and my one roommate would move out.\n\nSo I sat down and had\
  \ a conversation with my roommate about how he\u2019s going to need to move out\
  \ because we\u2019re going to need the extra space with the baby coming. He seemed\
  \ to take that okay. \n\nSo I talked to our landlord about and it. She said it would\
  \ be no problem to just not renew my shared lease with my roommate when was ending\
  \ in a little over 3 months. She would send him the official notice and just start\
  \ a new lease with me and my gf. That was almost two months ago.\n\nI came home\
  \ from work the other day and my roommate asked if we could talk. \n\nHe informed\
  \ me how hard finding a handicap accessible apartment in his price range in our\
  \ area. Some things I guess I never noticed about the area is that most of the residential\
  \ buildings are older so they don\u2019t have elevators in the buildings and aren\u2019\
  t legally required to because it would mess up the architecture of the buildings\
  \ too much.\n\nThe newer ones like ours are usually a lot more expensive, but landlord\
  \ gives us a good price because she\u2019s and old family friend and I help with\
  \ some of the maintenance stuff that she can\u2019t do anymore (she\u2019s kind\
  \ of old).\n\nThere are some places farther in the suburbs that are cheaper and\
  \ can be made handicapped accessible, but that\u2019s pretty far from his work and\
  \ there\u2019s less easy to get to public transportation.\n\nSo he wants to continue\
  \ staying until he can find a place. He pointed out we could fit the baby in our\
  \ bedroom (my gfs and mine), being that it\u2019s the masters, is a lot bigger than\
  \ his. If there\u2019s not enough room I could put my desk and some of my other\
  \ furniture in the living room.\n\nBut I know my gf would not be okay with that.\
  \ She\u2019s feels horrible and is already really stressed out as it is dealing\
  \ with her move. She does not want to have to deal with last weeks of her pregnancy\
  \ and raising a newborn with sharing a bathroom and other personal space with someone\
  \ she doesn\u2019t really know. That\u2019s why she planned her moving out of her\
  \ old place right after my roommate moved out.\n\nI told him I would talk to my\
  \ gf about it, so I sent her a text a while ago asking if she wanted me to pick\
  \ her up some dinner, so I could talk about it with her in person. She hasn\u2019\
  t texted back though, so I\u2019m assuming she\u2019s taking a nap.\n\nSo while\
  \ I\u2019m waiting I wrote this post. Getting it all out I\u2019m just thinking\
  \ that I don\u2019t really want him here either while we\u2019re starting parenthood\
  \ and I feel shitty about it all.\n\nUpdate: Definite no go from my gf. I guess\
  \ I\u2019ll just try to help him look for a new place and move."
