selftext: "I worked at a company in Barcelona for six years after college and learned\
  \ to speak Spanish and Catalan during my time abroad. I met and married my now-husband\
  \ after moving back to the US, and we had our daughter in April.\n\nMy husband thinks\
  \ it's great that I speak three languages and wants me to teach our daughter Spanish\
  \ (we don't think Catalan would be particularly useful in the US). He wants me to\
  \ speak to her exclusively in Spanish while he speaks to her in English so she doesn't\
  \ confuse the two languages. \n\nI do want our daughter to learn Spanish, but I'm\
  \ not sure I should be the one to teach her. I still speak the language fluently,\
  \ but I asked my Barcelona friends for an honest assessment of my abilities, and\
  \ their feedback was that I speak Spanish very well for a non-native speaker, but\
  \ I use the wrong preposition sometimes and phrase certain things in a way that\
  \ isn't technically wrong but sounds a bit \"off.\" I also have a pretty obvious\
  \ American accent.\n\nI'd much rather have our daughter learn from an actual native\
  \ speaker. I'm concerned she's going to pick up my grammar mistakes and my bad accent\
  \ if her exposure to the language is coming from me. Our local school district has\
  \ an excellent dual immersion program staffed by native speakers that we're planning\
  \ to enroll our daughter in once she enters kindergarten, but my husband wants her\
  \ to start learning Spanish as soon as possible. He says even if I don't speak it\
  \ perfectly, it will still benefit her in the long run. AITA?"
