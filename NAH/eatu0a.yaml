selftext: "Well, today I had to break some tough news to a friend of mine. He weight\
  \  a little over 400 and has rapidly declining health. He is in his mid 30s. Hes\
  \ not doing to well and is having a midlife crisis thinking he wont be around that\
  \ much longer. I assume theres more going on due to his weight and I am not going\
  \ to prod. Anyways, I'm a pilot and have a 172A (4 seater Cessna). He has wanted\
  \ to fly for a while, hes never been in a plane, let alone take the controls of\
  \ one.  He has been asking me and I told him I needed to look into some things and\
  \ I would let him know. Well after doing some math, with his weight  and size it\
  \ would not be safe. Hes too large, not only weight wise but I dont thing he could\
  \ fit inside the plane. Its tight. I looked into putting him in the back two seats\
  \ but the weight and balance just will not work out in a way I'm comfortable with.\
  \ For anyone who's not aviation savvy, the way you balance and distribute the weight\
  \ onboarding the plane is very important and can mean life or death if you over\
  \ load with fuel, passengers and luggage. Well today I had to break it to him. And\
  \ hes devestated. If he could motivate himself to lose weight I would gladly take\
  \ him up and even let him fly. But I dont think he took it that way. I am worried\
  \ that him knowing hes to big to safely fly in a plane will make his depression\
  \ 10x worse. But I cant take risks like that. And it sucks. I told him I would see\
  \ about finding someone with a private jet he could get on, but he would not be\
  \ able to fly it. \n\nAnyways, I feel aweful. But.... yeah. I told.him that if he\
  \ could use this as a way to motivated him, he would get free lessons from me if\
  \ I get my CFI. But I have a ways to go before that. \n\nEdit: I almost knew immediately\
  \ that there was no way it would work, but atleast I tried to make it work with\
  \ fiddling fuel load etc. But there was no way possible I could get anywhere near\
  \ safe load. I hope he uses this as a means of change\n\nUpdate: so this morning\
  \ I checked in on him. Hes not talking to me and his family thinks I'm fat shaming\
  \ him/making this up. This has really thrown me for a loop. I'm not really sure\
  \ how to explain this more than I already have to him. I dont make these rules,\
  \ I'm going to just assume hes very upset and trying to find someone to blame for\
  \ it and that he will eventually move on from this. So im not going to take anything\
  \ anyone says from his side to heart. As unfortunate as it is, a lot in his family\
  \ are the same weight and lifestyle. I know it hurt his feelings but I really didnt\
  \ expect him to take it further then that. If hes just mad with the reality of it\
  \ sinking in and needs someone to take it out on that's fine, whatever. But he needs\
  \ to understand that a lot of his problems are self induced. I will pull up some\
  \ W/B related crashes and send him those. He needs to realize it's more than his\
  \ life on the line. He may be ready to go but I'm not. And suicide by plane crash\
  \ isnt high on my lost of things to do. I'm a bit agitated at this point that this\
  \ ballooned today. Hes only thinking about himself and deluding himself into thinking\
  \ he deserves this. I didnt meant o offend him but I cant control how he decides\
  \ to see this.\n\nEdit 2: I'm female. XD sorry for not addressing that!"
