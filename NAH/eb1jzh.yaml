selftext: "My parents got a divorce when I was 6 and I haven't seen my mom since cause\
  \ she was abusive, my dad remarried when I was 8. My step mom wasn't abusive but\
  \ we never clicked, she tried to be my \"new mom\" right off the bat and I found\
  \ it weird and she didn't like how I wasn't open to the idea right away. She also\
  \ had a daughter who's 1 year younger than me, we didn't hit it off either. Don't\
  \ get me wrong she's a totally fine person but as kids she was the typical brat\
  \ so I guess it made it hard for us to really bond as kids I guess. Once I hit my\
  \ teens I had a rough patch of being rebellious and overall not a good person, my\
  \ dad gave me space like I needed but my step mom didn't see it that way and we\
  \ fought a lot cause of it. My step sister was alright during teen years she got\
  \ the more quiet and keep to yourself so we didn't have really any conflict. But\
  \ me and my step mom didn't hit it off and once I turned 18 I moved out first chance\
  \ I got.\n\nI am now 24 and my dad sadly passed away with cancer, tho I didn't get\
  \ along with my step mom I never stopped loving my dad and we texted daily when\
  \ I moved out. It was rough on me and I do appreciate my step mom helping me with\
  \ the funeral but that was a couple months ago and I haven't really talked to her\
  \ since. My step sister has invited me over for christmas, and honestly I don't\
  \ know if I want to go. Not cause I don't like them but because its the same house\
  \ that we grew up in and it will remind me too much of my dad and I'm still grieving.\
  \  I know my step sister and step mom are too but fuck it sucks cause IDK I just\
  \ want to be left alone for some time to process cause it was only 3 months ago.\
  \  \n\nAITA if I don't show up to christmas day at my step mom's place? \n\nIGNORE\
