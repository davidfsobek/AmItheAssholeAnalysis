selftext: "I'm 25 and living abroad in the United States. I've been here for three\
  \ years now and am fortunate that I've been able to visit home at least once each\
  \ year for a short break. However my father has only been able to fly over once\
  \ two years ago as part of a work trip on which he brought my very religious step-mother.\
  \ We don't get on to say the least.\n\nMy parents have been divorced for ten plus\
  \ years now and both remarried very quickly. After the usual family court drama\
  \ I was able to get myself placed with my dad. This meant living with his new wife\
  \ who had a large, practicing conservative Jewish family including my three new\
  \ step-siblings.\n\nI went from minimum levels of practicing - we used to watch\
  \ TV after lighting Shabbat candles - to having to do everything, immediately and\
  \ without care that this was a lot and new to very young me.\n\nI didn't enjoy having\
  \ to suddenly be religious and it's not a big part of my life now. However, I'm\
  \ an adult now, living abroad and have just moved in with an American girl into\
  \ a new apartment. She is not Jewish.\n\nMy father is visiting, along with his wife,\
  \ between Christmas and New Years for a few days. I want my father to come see me\
  \ and my new home, I want to show him that he raised me well and thank him for his\
  \ sacrifices. I want to be able to say, hey dad this is the girl I love and I want\
  \ you to meet her. But I can't do that with his wife hanging over us, casting aspersions\
  \ about the ungodliness of my living situation and partner.\n\nI've brought this\
  \ up with my dad but he's not keen on leaving his wife behind, even just for a few\
  \ hours. I feel that it's a multi-day trip, she's an adult and can probably find\
  \ something to do. I would like those hours as quality time with my dad and for\
  \ him to meet my partner. AITA for insisting she not come along?\n\n**Update Edit**:\
  \ Just wanted to say thank you to everyone for your input. I've spoken with my dad\
  \ and have arranged a compromise - he's going to come over late afternoon by himself\
  \ and see the place. Then we will all have dinner, the four of us. My stepmother\
  \ would be alone for a short while but we'll all be together in the evening.  \n\
  \  \nI wanted to add something that I haven't seen anyone else mention though I\
  \ did forgot to add it in my initial post. I don't think it's fair to subject my\
  \ partner to my stepmother and her beliefs. The two of us are a team and if comments\
  \ are made they're directed at both of us, not just myself. If I can avoid unnecessary\
  \ confrontation by excluding someone who has a history of toxicity on this matter,\
  \ I think I have a responsibility to do so. That said, my partner is fine with the\
  \ newest arrangements, is aware that things might not be straightforward and we'll\
  \ face them head-on together. Thanks again for all your input."
