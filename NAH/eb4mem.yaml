selftext: "One of my best friends is throwing a small birthday party. It'll be just\
  \ a few close friends drinking at her place before continuing to a club. She purposely\
  \ didn't invite a lot of people and wanted to make it a girls' nights out.  \n\n\
  My boyfriend didn't think much of it until he found out what I was planning on wearing.\
  \ He was at my place when I was sorting out my outfit and when he saw it, he told\
  \ me it's tasteless and very provocative and not in a subtle, interesting way. I\
  \ recently got thigh high latex boots and planned on wearing those with a skirt\
  \ and a crop top. Every piece of the outfit is latex and I was kinda digging the\
  \ vibe of it so I figured that'll be my outfit for the night. We got into a slight\
  \ argument over it and he basically said that there should be a limit to how provocative\
  \ someone dresses when they are in a relationship; saying I'd look like a hooker\
  \ in that outfit. I fired back and we argued over it but it never escalated to something\
  \ huge although my boyfriend, even though he said he can't tell me not to wear it,\
  \ still thinks it's tasteless to attend a friend's birthday party looking like a\
  \ hooker.  \n\nThe birthday is in a few days and I want to know whether I'm an asshole\
  \ for wanting to wear said outfit at the party. So, AITA for wanting to dress a\
  \ certain way during a birthday party?"
