selftext: "Hi everyone, I\u2019m really feeling like I\u2019m in a tricky spot right\
  \ now. I just graduated university and am working towards really starting my life.\
  \ I would love to do some travelling before beginning my career, as a way of congratulating\
  \ myself for graduating (I have worked 30-35 hours per week for the last two years\
  \ of my program, and it\u2019s been stressful at times). \n\nIn past years, I\u2019\
  ve always been pretty generous about buying my siblings, parents, etc. gifts for\
  \ Christmas. The issue now is that while I can technically afford it (I\u2019ve\
  \ managed to save about $17000 over the last couple years), I have over $20000 of\
  \ student debt and no guarantee of a great job right off the bat. I would love to\
  \ be super frugal and save every penny I can right now by not buying gifts to fund\
  \ travelling and relaxation before entering the \u201Creal world\u201D. \n\nI am\
  \ planning on making Christmas cards and baked goods with my little sisters and\
  \ giving that away instead of any real gifts. I guess I\u2019m just feeling internally\
  \ awful about it bc I\u2019m pretending that I can\u2019t afford to buy presents\
  \ when in reality it\u2019s my selfishness pushing me to go this route. WIBTA for\
  \ this? I\u2019m feeling like the Grinch.\n\nEdit to add: I have been somewhat straight\
  \ up with the fact that I feel it important to keep the money I have for my life\
  \ right now. I talk with my parents quite often about strategies for paying off\
  \ my loans so they know that I am thinking a lot about my financial situation. I\
  \ have not mentioned anything about a holiday bc I don\u2019t have a plan yet but\
  \ will be 100% honest when I do. I don\u2019t think anyone in my family will fault\
  \ me for it but I don\u2019t know. \nI also don\u2019t receive extravagant presents\
  \ - $50 from my parents and dollar store items from my siblings some years."
