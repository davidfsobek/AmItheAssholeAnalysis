selftext: "I know I'm in the wrong somewhere but I don't know where. Please explain\
  \ it kindly, I'm already feeling sad and dumb.\n\nMy husband has always had DQ ice\
  \ cream cake for his family birthday event. I am lactose intolerant and I've never\
  \ liked Dairy Queen or ice cream. Every year (we've been together 5 years)  I get\
  \ pumped for dessert and every year I get to watch everyone eat cake I can't have\
  \ for our birthday.\n\nNormally I'd say it's his birthday and I can and should suck\
  \ it up, but we share the same birthday ! Same day, same year, fucks clerks and\
  \ accountants up every time. So his family birthday is always a joint birthday party\
  \ for us but they still just do stuff he likes every year. I don't think my family\
  \ does the same thing to him.\n\nWhen I tried to explain that while it wasn't a\
  \ big deal, I'm a little hurt that his parents always got a cake I hate, he was\
  \ uncharacteristically short with me. He reacted like I was trying to ruin his favourite\
  \ birthday tradition, which I didn't understand (because he's usually pretty supportive\
  \ and because it's not even good cake). Since then we haven't really talked about\
  \ it, but I'm really confused. \n\nI'm trans and my inlaws are conservative rednecks\
  \ so our relationship is fraught, but I genuinely don't think they were trying to\
  \ be passive aggressive about this. They just have terrible taste in cake and can\
  \ be kind of inconsiderate. All I want is someone to bring me a cupcake or something\
  \ to show they thought about me. Why won't he take my side? Is he defensive because\
  \ he's feeling caught between me and his family? Is it just cake and none of this\
  \ really matters?"
