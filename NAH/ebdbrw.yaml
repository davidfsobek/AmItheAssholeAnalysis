selftext: 'Christmas is coming up (obviously) so I spent a ton on buying some cute
  gifts for my girlfriend. I''m going up to see her on New Year''s Eve and we will
  be exchanging gifts then.


  I got her a bunch of cute stuff she likes and put it in a little basket. As well
  as that I got a really nice ring I know she wanted as well as Starbucks vouchers,
  and I''m really excited to see her reaction. I spent a lot of time and effort making
  this gift and as a broke college student it was fairly expensive for me.


  The thing is, she keeps asking me what I''ve got and getting jokingly annoyed (not
  like argument level) when I don''t tell her. She''s already sussed out one of the
  small gifts (not an important one) so I''m reluctant to tell her too much, but I
  made the mistake of telling her something "very nice" got finally delivered to me
  today and she''s been badgering me about it all morning.


  I ended up telling her I got her a cute hoodie and she got super excited about it.
  The thing is, I didn''t actually get a hoodie I just wanted to say something so
  she stops asking. The actual gift I got her is a lot more expensive but now I''m
  worried she''ll be disappointed when she doesn''t get a cute hoodie from me and
  I''m seriously considering ordering one as well.


  AITA for telling a white lie about what I''ve got her just up until she opens the
  gifts.'
