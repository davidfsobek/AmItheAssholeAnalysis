selftext: "I have two cousins. One 12 and one 10.\n\nThe 12 year old absolutely loves\
  \ painting, she paints with a cheap set of watercolours she got from school on printer\
  \ painter. When she comes over to visit I let her use my stuff and we paint together.\n\
  \nSo for Christmas I  have brought her a nice set of Windsor and newton paints,\
  \ proper paper for water colours and a set of brushes. All together this cost me\
  \ just over \xA390, it is way over my budget but I know she will use and appreciate\
  \ them so I don't mind. (I did talk this through with her parents as well)\n\nThe\
  \ AITA part is regarding her brother. I felt bad for spending so much on his sister\
  \ and not him so I did spend a bit more and brought him a game for his Nintendo\
  \ switch that he has mentioned (yoshi's crafted world) which is \xA340. \n\nAITA\
  \ for spending \xA350 more on his sisters present? I know I am still spending a\
  \ lot on him but would he think I am being unfair or that I didn't like him as much?"

  \ lot less on her brother (10m)"
