selftext: "My MIL is really a lovely woman who can\u2019t help but go uncomfortably\
  \ overboard every Christmas. She spends literally thousands of dollars on myself\
  \ and my husband. Clothes, housewares, basically anything Kohl\u2019s sells. They\
  \ are not rich people and my husband believes it\u2019s her way of making up for\
  \ the fact that they didn\u2019t have a lot growing up. \nAll the gifts make me\
  \ feel so uncomfortable and then my husband feels so guilty for \u201Cnot doing\
  \ enough\u201D for them in return. We could financially match her spending but we\
  \ both agree that wouldn\u2019t be responsible however that doesn\u2019t make it\
  \ not awkward. \nWe are having our first child any day now and she\u2019s been very\
  \ clear that she intends to go even more overboard on her grandchild. This really\
  \ steps on my toes as \u201CSanta\u201D. I worry about my daughter having unrealistic\
  \ expectations of Christmas as she gets older. It also takes away from my ability\
  \ to feel like I\u2019ve provided a special Christmas for my daughter. \nMy husband\
  \ just says it makes her happy and to leave her alone. I\u2019m not ungrateful or\
  \ maybe I am? I just feel like some sort of spending limit would be appropriate."
