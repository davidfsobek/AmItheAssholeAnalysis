selftext: 'Full disclosure: I already have other pre-existing grievances with this
  family member so my view is possibly at least a little bit coloured by my frustration
  with them, which is a series of many other posts I could make. Sorry if the following
  is slightly confusing but I wanted to try to reduce the likelihood of being recognised
  IRL.


  Anyway, I met up with family member for dinner a few weeks ago. Let''s call them
  Quinn. We had a friendly chat about what''s been happening in our lives, and of
  course I had to ask how my little cousin was doing. My little cousin (we''ll call
  ''em Charlie) is autistic and non-verbal, though they have a few specific words
  they use to communicate, express their feelings and get what they want or need.
  Getting them to talk a bit has been a very slow process, with a lot of heartache,
  tantrums and effort. While Quinn was updating me on that progress, I recalled a
  visit the family had at our house. Charlie has a phone which is mostly used for
  YouTube Kids, and I''ve seen Charlie typing in the search bar to get videos that
  interest them the most. In fact, Charlie is really good at using the phone and switching
  between apps.


  So I suggested that, since Charlie is able to type, maybe they should get a keyboard
  or text-to-speech device to assist in communication, and hopefully reduce the heartache.


  Quinn paused for a moment to think about it but said that they don''t want to get
  something like that for Charlie because "it might discourage Charlie from speaking
  at all".


  In my opinion, such a thing could be a really good boost for Charlie''s communication
  in general, if it''s used correctly. Charlie already has some aptitude for electronic
  devices, can write a little, can search for videos on YouTube Kids, and does communicate
  decently by using physical actions and by taking people to things or places. They
  were attending a sign language class but the second Charlie could speak at all,
  they dropped it. I get that mum and dad just want to hear their baby talk, but they
  talk a lot about how frustrating it can be when they can''t figure out what Charlie
  is trying to say. They''ve always been the kind of parents who think they know best,
  even when they don''t. They dragged their heels about getting Charlie a diagnosis
  when my mother (who had experience) insisted they should, claiming it was normal
  for their child to be so far behind in development.


  So my question really is, WIBTA if I pushed the issue? I know there is a potential
  for abuse with these devices with parents/guardians leading the child to make certain
  statements, but I also know that Charlie has some language skills and typing ability
  and it could be used as a supportive thing, not necessarily as the main method of
  communication and to me it feels like they''re kind of sabotaging Charlie by not
  providing this. However, I do also understand that I''m seeing the situation as
  an outsider and there may be missing information on my part. Should I say something
  else or just drop it?'
