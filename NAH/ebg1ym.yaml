selftext: 'My siblings each have multiple kids. I have none. This year they decided
  that buying for christmas is too expensive and so they want us all to just buy for
  the kids but not each other.


  This means I''m shelling out for each of my nieces and nephews but getting no gifts
  of my own.


  I haven''t said anything to them, nor do I plan to, but am I the asshole for feeling
  selfish and wanting gifts to come my way as well?'
