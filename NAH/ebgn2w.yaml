selftext: "I (21M) come from a matriarchal family. My dad has been asent since when\
  \ I was young (separated from mom, so he doesn't bother), so it was just me, my\
  \ mother and my three sisters.\n\nI always had no sense of self. Just felt like\
  \ something wasn't quite right. I love my family but I needed space.\n\nThe only\
  \ thing that helped me was therapy. Now I am becoming much more solid in myself.\
  \ I'm becoming more assertive and not a pushover, I'm lifting weights and bulking\
  \ up and taken up more masculine hobbies (boxing, fishing, etc). \n\nI guess I have\
  \ learned to \"become my own father\" (a phrase my therapist told me). I have started\
  \ to become more distant from my sisters while I have time to find myself.\n\nMy\
  \ oldest sister (30F) asked me why I'm avoiding her lately and hanging out more\
  \ with my male friends, because we always used to be close (by close, I mean I just\
  \ listen to all her problems and get little in return). \n\nThen she said that lifting\
  \ weights and doing these things won't make me more of a man, that \"being open\
  \ and honest is more masculine than any of that\". I stopped her right there, while\
  \ what she said wasn't entirely wrong, I felt insulted.\n\nI said \"Why don't you\
  \ stop trying to tell me how to be a man, just like I never told you how to be a\
  \ woman. I don't want to hear your opinions on masculinity\". She got pissed off\
  \ and called me AH. \n\nThis is my own journey. I don't value her input at all,\
  \ and I felt insulted. But she felt insulted at what I said. AITA?"
title: AITA for telling my sister that she shouldn't be giving me advice on what it
  means to be a man?
