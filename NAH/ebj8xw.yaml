selftext: "So I\u2019m graduating from med school after nearly eight years of post\
  \ hs schooling and it just so happens my birthday is within a week of my graduation\
  \ date (winter graduation) and christmas, So me and my family are conveniently celebrating\
  \ all three at once. It\u2019s an cmas party with a focus on me.\n\nSince it\u2019\
  s centered around me this year my family (includes wife\u2019s family) have been\
  \ telling me to just sit back and let them do everything. But something\u2019s been\
  \ bothering me. My wife has been going a little overboard with micromanaging my\
  \ mom and her mom on the party details. It\u2019s not exactly a surprise so I know\
  \ about what\u2019s going on because they tell me.\n\nI\u2019ve been with her since\
  \ undergrad (she\u2019s graduating next spring) and we cook together all the time\
  \ so she knows a lot of details about what I like and don\u2019t like. This goes\
  \ for food, presents, themes, music, noise levels, etc. and it\u2019s kinda excessive\
  \ how she\u2019s running my mom and my mom in law i get along with inlaws great\
  \ btw) ragged trying to make it perfect for me. They look exhausted. She gets on\
  \ my father and father in law too but not as much. wife looks even more exhausted.\n\
  \nI told her to relax yesterday and I don\u2019t want her to gas herself out for\
  \ me like that, and I wanted it to be relaxed and not put everyone on edge. She\
  \ got upset and said she was doing it for me cause she wants everything perfect\
  \ for me. She\u2019s been kinda down since then and now I feel bad. Was I the asshole?"
