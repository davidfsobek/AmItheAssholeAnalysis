selftext: 'This will be a financial AITA but hear me out: I work a fairly low wage
  job. The kind of job where people count pennies to make it to the end of the month.
  And I happen to have this fairly unusual hobby - I''m learning Japanese and I love
  Japanese culture. I live in France, so a holiday to Japan costs quite a lot of money,
  even if I pick the least expensive options (low-cost flights and the shoddiest of
  hotels).


  Now, following a massive quarter-life crisis last year and overcoming deep depression,
  I realised life was too short to just sit around longing for something you never
  get. So I took a side job that work along with my full-time job. It doesn''t pay
  that much, but it makes me more than enough to pay for plane ticket and a hotel
  twice a year. So I decided to visit Japan alone twice a year. I love these trips
  and they do wonders for my mental health.


  However, my family, colleagues and friends all think I''m a massive asshole for
  taking two expensive holidays twice a year. I hear lots of snarky comments on how
  I must have tons of money or be in debt at work. People act very surprised when
  they learn that I''ve been on holiday *yet again*. My family thinks it''s a massive
  waste of money that I could put on the side or spend on something else (what, I
  don''t know, at home I have a fairly parsimonious lifestyle: I don''t like expensive
  things, I don''t club, I don''t have and don''t want a car nor a child). My husband
  doesn''t think much of it since our finances are completely separate. The only thing
  that bugs him is that I spend holiday time on a trip without him, but I still have
  some paid vacation on the side for us to go somewhere together once a year, so it''s
  not a huge deal.
