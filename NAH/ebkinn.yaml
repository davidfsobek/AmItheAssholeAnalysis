  M and I have been dating for 3 years and honestly, it''s been pretty good minus
  some hiccups. About two years ago, highly unhappy with my body, I started working
  out. I loved it and have made great progress and I''m actually prepping for my first
  bikini contest this spring!! Between working out, meal prepping, strict dieting,
  school, work, etc., M has been feeling a bit left out. I''m out of the house basically
  from 8am-8pm when you factor in commutes and gym time after work. I get home, and
  I''m really just exhausted.


  M and I do not live together, which seems to be the major issue here. I''m exhausted
  when I get home and quite frankly just want to lay in bed and go to sleep. He''s
  been getting more and more frustrated when I decline his requests to come over and/or
  to hangout on weeknights, and I just feel like as two working adults, it shouldn''t
  really be that big of a deal. It''s not like I''m going out without him or anything,
  I''m literally just going home to go to sleep and get ready for the next day!


  In the coming months, my schedule is just going to get worse and worse as I close
  in on my 16-week prep before the show. He continually asks me to skip the gym or
  take cheat meals and it just isn''t an option for me right now.


  I''ve also been getting a lot more attention from other men since I started working
  out and obtaining a better physique, and I can tell that''s been getting to him,
  but I''d never cheat on him, I love him. Since we haven''t been seeing each other
  as much lately, we''ve also been having less sex, so I feel like his mind is traveling
  to all of the wrong places.


  I really don''t want my relationship to end just because I currently have some goals
  that he doesn''t align with. Any advice or input, both negative and positive, is
  more than welcome.

  _____________________________

  TL;DR - Seeing my boyfriend less because of lifestyle changes that come with being
  a bodybuilder, he''s not happy about added attention from other men, less time seeing
  each other, and my reluctance to skip gym sessions or prepped meals to spend more
  time with him.

  **UPDATE** - Talked to him last night, and I was firm in wanting to give this contest
  my all for the next few months and tried to forfeit one night a week for a few hours
  but it seems that wasn''t enough. He had different ideas and even threw one out
  there about moving in together and all in all it ended with us taking a break. It
  just seems like right now we''re at different points in our life right now.'
