selftext: ' My nephew recently had a birthday and my husband and I bought and shipped
  him a few books. He LOVES to read and specifically asked for books. One of the books
  we sent was The Absolutely True Diary of a Part Time Indian by Sherman Alexie. I
  taught secondary English for a short time and a lot of kids (particularly boys)
  love it, plus it has received numerous awards. It''s one of my top favorite YA novels,
  so I was happy to send it to him and hoped he would like it along with the other
  books we sent, plus my nephew is from the same general area that the novel takes
  place in, has trouble fitting in (like the main character), and has some physical
  disabilities (like the main character), so I thought he would think it was pretty
  neat. Honestly...it''s a book that feels like when you''re reading it, you''re talking
  to an old friend. It makes me laugh and cry. When he talks about his dog dying in
  the beginning, I bawl my eyes out. There are other parts where I cry my eyes out.
  There are so many parts that make me laugh. The ending is beautiful. I have the
  audio version and I try to listen to it once every year or so. It''s just a \*really\*
  good book.


  My SIL is dating and lives with a Native American guy, so my nephew also lives there.
  I have never actually met her SO. Anyways, her SO is apparently really pissed that
  we sent that book. He''s taking it as a slight to him in some way. I definitely
  didn''t mean for him to take any offense to it. The book had nothing to do with
  him. It was just a gift for my nephew and one of the few YA novels that has a male
  protagonist that I knew he hasn''t read yet. I just really wanted to share it with
  him. AITA for gifting it to my nephew?'
