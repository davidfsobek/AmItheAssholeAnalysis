selftext: 'Hi, I (38F) have moved for my husband''s (39M) career twice already. The
  first time was a cross-country move that I think set my career back by a couple
  of years because I never really landed in a solid job. The second time was another
  cross-country move that happened with two weeks notice. It was to the hub of my
  industry and ended up being great for my career, but was still several months of
  anxiety-inducing and uncertain job searching.


  He now has an opportunity to move internationally for his job. I finally feel settled
  in a great company with awesome job prospects and feel reluctant to leave it. But
  we have two young kids and it seems absurd to do international long distance.


  The money that he''d make in his international opportunity is significant to us--
  it is worth several years of my salary. So it feels like it''d be silly to give
  it up.  However, it''s covered by our prenuptial agreement (that he insisted that
  we sign) so that all the money would go to him. He''s always been generous with
  me and hasn''t ever seemed disloyal. But I''m scared that if I move internationally
  it''ll mean risking my career. If he leaves me I''d be in a precarious situation
  with two young kids.


  WIBTA if I asked for some of that money to be given to me in a separate account
  as a condition of me moving for his job? It feels dicey since I agreed it was his
  money when we got married, and I don''t want to come across as being after his money
  / accusing him of being disloyal.'
