selftext: "Hi- I am 14 years old. I recently got a new Lenovo legion laptop from my\
  \ grandparents. When I first got it my father didn\u2019t mind me using it and barely\
  \ paid any attention. However, recently he\u2019s been using it for rendering video\
  \ since it\u2019s more powerful than his computer. I am perfectly ok with him using\
  \ my laptop for stuff, but I tend to get territorial when he starts snooping around\
  \ in my files. I don\u2019t really have much to hide, with the exception of a few\
  \ violent video games. Whenever he\u2019s browsing through my stuff, I\u2019ll slip\
  \ in a comment like \u201CI\u2019d appreciate it if you didn\u2019t go through my\
  \ stuff.\u201D or \u201CI\u2019m going to bed so if you could let me turn off my\
  \ computer that\u2019d be great.\u201D He always responds very defensively saying\
  \ that he as my father is entitled to go through my stuff. I am always very responsible\
  \ and make straight A\u2019s, so I personally don\u2019t see any reason I should\
  \ be allowed SOME privacy. I\u2019m I in the wrong here?"
