selftext: "I (21m) work 2 jobs, One being a machinst job at a big shop working second\
  \ shift (3:30 PM -11:30PM) and my other job is running my own lawncare/landscaping\
  \ business. Over the past 2 years my business has easily doubled in size taking\
  \ up the majority of my free time.  My daily routine usually starts at 7AM out the\
  \ door to cut grass, finish up around 2, take a quick shower, then off to the shop\
  \ until 11:30.  This happens 5-6 days a week most weeks, and by the time I get home\
  \ at midnight I am pretty gassed and ready to just flop into bed. My girlfriend\
  \ is the very bubbly type and loves laying in bed and talking for a couple hours,\
  \ which is completely fine with me on the weekends, which is when she spends the\
  \ night with me at my parents house.  The other day she asked me to stay over a\
  \ couple nights during the week, and I told her it wasn\u2019t a good idea because\
  \ when I get home I pretty much just go right to sleep. Well her and my mom got\
  \ so pissed at me and called me a selfish AH because I want to get right to sleep\
  \ when I get home. I could see where they were coming from if she didn\u2019t sleep\
  \ with me at all, but that isn\u2019t the case. I kind of feel bad because I do\
  \ enjoy spending time with her but I do really enjoy having a few minutes of silence\
  \ before going to sleep. AITA?"
