selftext: "So my husband and I are infertile and we need donor sperm. My husband wants\
  \ to use his brother's sperm because that way he would at least still be related\
  \ biologically. Which I understand but I just really hate the idea. I'm not a huge\
  \ fan of his brother in the first place, pretty much every story my husband tells\
  \ about him is negative and we just don't get along as people. On top of that they\
  \ look nothing alike, we could find an anonymous donor that looks more like my husband.\
  \ Husband is dark brown almost black hair with brown eyes and his brother is dirty\
  \ blonde with blue eyes. Their face shapes are different and they just really do\
  \ not look similar at all. And to top it all off we are infertile because of cancer\
  \ and the cancer is thought to be genetic, but they haven't isolated the gene yet,\
  \ which means we don't know if BIL carries that gene or not and I would really like\
  \ to give our kids the best chance possible for NOT having that. We have been arguing\
  \ about it on and off for a while now and I just don't know what to think. He thinks\
  \ I'm being unreasonable because all he wants is to still be biologically related\
  \ to our kids and I'm trying to take that from him. But I feel like his want to\
  \ be related has made him overlook other issues with using his brother's sperm.\
  \ \n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust to add before someone asks, he has already asked his brother\
  \ if he would be comfortable donating sperm to us and he said yes so if I agreed\
  \ to it we would be all set, it really is just me keeping that from happening."
