selftext: 'This is inspired by another, similar post about equal gift giving however
  it isn''t anything I''ve brought up with anyone for reasons that will hopefully
  become clear.


  I (24) and my brother (27) are the only grandchildren and only 2 of 4 direct family
  members our grandfather has (there''s just his sister, son/our father and the two
  of us). Anyway, he worked as an engineer his entire life and only retired about
  5 years ago. He isn''t super wealthy, but very comfortable, let''s say.


  My brother is the type that constantly asks for help, financially and otherwise.
  There''s nothing necessarily wrong with that, but it means that by asking, he gets
  it - family members are always "helping" him do stupid stuff he could do himself
  like putting up a shelf, getting rid of some ants in his kitchen, and most recently,
  buying an alarm system for his new house.) It is nearly always our grandfather that
  pays for this stuff. In the past 5 years he has bought a car, washing machine, let
  him (brother) live with him rent free for a while, given him money to put gas in
  his car, and most recently, dropped about $400 on an alarm.


  I''ve received nothing like the help he has. My grandfather put some money towards
  a laptop when I started college 5 years ago and that''s it. I don''t like asking
  for help and feel awkward at best, downright entitled at worst going "Oh grandad,
  I''d love a new car but I just can''t afford it...hint hint".


  So here''s what I''m struggling with internally: am I an asshole for expecting to
  be treated the same? Is my brother an asshole for taking advantage of everyone?
  Am I not seeing the big picture and while my brother has received help, that''s
  not to say I won''t at some point? Lastly, should I lose my integrity (which is
  what I think I would be doing) by playing the game and asking for people to buy
  for me all the time like he does?'
