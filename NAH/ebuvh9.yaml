  Obvious throwaway is obvious.


  To start out, my father had COPD for the last 15ish years and he just got a new
  pair of lungs this year. For the last 10 years, all family and friends were aware
  that they needed to get the flu shot because it''d be bad for my dad to catch flu.


  After several years of getting the flu shot because of this, my best friend decided
  to stop getting it around 4 years ago without telling me. I found out when she jokingly
  made a comment about how she has "not had a flu shot in 4 years and has not gotten
  the flu".


  I found out at her kid''s 1st birthday party, during flu season.


  I waited until cooling down to call her out (the next day over text) and I blew
  up at her and said some pretty mean things where I knew it would hurt. She admitted
  completely to knowing she was supposed to get the flu shot, but asked me to "respect
  her beliefs" in not getting it. I proceeded to tell her to not contact me unless
  it was with an apology for the 4 years she failed to mention it.


  TLDR: Dad has lung condition that leaves his immune system vunerable. Best friend
  knowingly decides to stop getting flu shot without telling me. I cut off ties.


  AITA?'
