selftext: This is the first time I've been able to articulate this to anyone. It goes
  back pretty far. So I live in PA. I've been very close friends with this guy, let's
  call him Gary, for about 7 years now. People tend to compare us to Mac and Dennis
  from it's Always Sunny. Anyway, after college we decided it was time to move about
  40 minutes away to be closer to his band. He kept saying "we have to. It's my dream."
  At that time I didn't have much of a dream. I just wanted to stay near my buddy.
  There, we lived in an awful crackshack-esque building for a year. Ultimately, however,
  we ended up living in a townhouse for an additional 2 years. It wasn't all bad,
  but I've made many sacrafices including getting robbed at the crackshack, bed bugs,
  and the way his band treated me. The lead singer just hated my guts from day one.
  We were just opposites. He labled me a bitch, and nothing could change that. Agrobro.
  So the band breaks up, and Gary is left with 1 friend, me. It's obvious to him that
  I feel we've wasted our youth with the band. He kept giving me possitive reaffirmations.
  "Now it's your turn." "Now we'll do what you wanna do. Whats your dream?" Stuff
  like that. After all, he held the reigns for 3 years. It made sense I'd choose our
  next step. So I told him I've always wanted to live in CO. He thought it was a great
  idea, so we drove the 20 hours. Transplanting was harder than we thought, so we
  ended up spending a month looking affordable housing, then returned home. (Housing
  is most expensive during skii season.) So we basically scouted it out for our return.
  Now I'm not being biased or exaggerating, he showed no indication of doubt. None
  whatsoever. He was 100% confident that in a few months (when it's warmer) we'll
  return with a better strategy. 4 days ago he told me that he think he's decided
  he's not doing back. He couldn't give me a straight reason. He was being cliche
  and saying things like, "i just won't be happy" and "I already did Colorado." He
  knows how hard things were for me while I was supporting his music career. Its very
  hurtful. I feel like if I continue to be his friend, these things will continue
  to happen because it's his nature to just fend for himself. Regardless of whether
  I stick around, or go off to CO alone, what do you guys think?
