selftext: "I know the title sounds extremely bad. But hear me out.\n \nWhen I was\
  \ 18, I was dating this 24 year old. Eventually she became pregnant. I was scared\
  \ shitless. I tried to hide it, and eventually she broke up with me because of that.\
  \ I did try and reach out to them to no avail. I tried to contact him separately\
  \ when he was 18, and he agreed. \n \nWhen we were together, he screamed at me for\
  \ not being there. He said that him and his mother struggled so much without a permanent\
  \ father figure. I tried to reason with him and tell my side of the story. He just\
  \ asked me to shut up. That was 5 years ago.\n \nNow he's 22. He very recently finished\
  \ college and asked me if he could live at my place. I really don't want to. I have\
  \ a wife, and my daughter. I really don't want things to be confusing, and him being\
  \ extremely rude to me doesn't help. My wife, arguably the most important, agreed\
  \ with me. It's just a couple of my friends disagree. They're calling me a huge\
  \ ass. \n \nThey basically tell me to look at things from his perspective. He had\
  \ a single, emotionally and financially abusive mom. He wants to be away from her,\
  \ but is too financially dependent. I agree that sounds shitty, but he hasn't even\
  \ apologized for his actions. \n \nSo, almighty Reddit. AITA?\n \nEdit: I did try\
  \ to contact them several times, but I simply couldn't. She changed het last name\
  \ and moved across the country."
