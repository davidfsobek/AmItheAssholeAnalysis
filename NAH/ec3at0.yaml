selftext: "I (20M) have female friends, and have had girlfriends before, however I'm\
  \ beginning to find that I vastly prefer a small but tight group of close male friends\
  \ rather than mixed.\n\nLast year I mainly hung in a mixed group of about 6 (3 girls,\
  \ 3 guys) and we were close. \n\nBut now I'm starting to hang out with these other\
  \ 4 guys a lot more. I'm beginning to realize that I actually much prefer this.\
  \ Something just feels \"right\" whereas it didn't before. We do everything together-\
  \ study, hang out, mess around and approach girls when we go clubbing. \n\nI asked\
  \ these guys whether they felt the same and they all agreed. This isn't to say I\
  \ don't have close female friends, but I always prefer hanging with a group of guys.\
  \ \n\nMy sister asked me why I'm hanging out with this group more and more and I\
  \ told her what i just said above. She called me AH. I'm not sure if I am. AITA?"
