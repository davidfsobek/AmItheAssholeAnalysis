selftext: "So for context I'm a 24 year old man and still live at home, I am currently\
  \ looking for a new job to soon change that though\n\nSome other things that are\
  \ important to mention. I have a pet ball python and she's my first pet that I have\
  \ 100% responsability for. I do a lot of research to make sure I don't half ass\
  \ her care. We have a dog too but while she's the family pet, I am the one who washes\
  \ and walks her because my parents can't be bothered. \n\nI also work part time\
  \ at a gas station and my daily tasks are usually along the lines of cleaning the\
  \ entire store, prepping fast food and lifting heavy boxes in the cooler for 1 hour\
  \ straight, so while it's part time I am still a little tired after work, and then\
  \ I need to check on my snake. \n\nBut then as soon as I get home I am instantly\
  \ bombarded with chores by my mom. Wash our dishes, clean out your dad's lunch box\
  \ (this one in particular drives me crazy), make dinner, clean up leftovers, sweep,\
  \ feed my birds, etc. It's exhausting to be bombarded with these things at 6pm in\
  \ the afternoon.\n\nI think I am a clean person so if it was my day off, I would\
  \ have lots of energy to do these. I have even tried asking my mom if I can do cleaning\
  \ on my days off instead and she takes it like a personal attack for some reason\
  \ and it goes into a rant how she's tired because she has a real job and I don't\
  \ so I can't possibly be tired. (She works in quality control at a factory so she's\
  \ at a desk responding to calls and emails most of the time.)\n\nThis is stressful\
  \ enough but it's becoming a problem because it's interfering with the stuff I already\
  \ need to do. \n\nFor example of something she does a lot, \nThe other day my parents\
  \ were leaving and asked if I wanted to come and I said no because I had a lot of\
  \ plans like doing the monthly deep clean on my snakes enclosure, giving the dog\
  \ a bath because she caked herself in mud and cleaning my room. My mom then asked\
  \ me to basically clean the entire house before they got home (they would have been\
  \ gone 4 hours)\n\nShe got mad that I said I would try but my plans might take priority\
  \ and I was going to do them first. I stopped cleaning stuff about 30 minutes before\
  \ they got home and my mom yelled at me, again, that I didn't do enough. \n\nAnd\
  \ then another example, Sunday I let her know first thing in the morning I was leaving\
  \ for DND night at my friends. She knew for hours but then suddenly, one hour before\
  \ I had to leave she told me to again clean the entire house before I left and I\
  \ had to tell my friends I would be running late.\n\nEdit: for those who were asking\
  \ I don't pay for rent but I pay for my car, my share of food except dinner, my\
  \ own toiletries and basically anything else I need. I would pay for a lot more\
  \ but my pay is low, why I'm looking for a new full time job\n\nEdit 2: after reading\
  \ your comments, a lot were a wake up call for me. The official judgement was no\
  \ aholes here but now, after reading your comments, I feel that is wrong. I believe\
  \ I have been selfish and a bit lazy. I am currently looking for trade and factory\
  \ jobs so I get a good pay and can start paying my mom rent as I physically, financially\
  \ can't atm with my current crappy job I want to quit. And I am currently drafting\
  \ a long term plan to save up money and move out. Thank you all for helping me look\
  \ at my life through a strangers eyes and I know venting to friends can be a bit\
  \ of a validation only sort of thing."
