selftext: "\n\nI have a small apartment building with 6 residences. One of them is\
  \ mine. Four of them have been occupied by the same tenants for years. The last\
  \ one is newly occupied by a family with 2 kids.\n\nThe dad of the family a came\
  \ by yesterday and asked if it would be possible to ban smoking in the courtyard\
  \ since it\u2019s not a safe neighborhood and an enclosed placed like the courtyard\
  \ for kids to play would be much safer for them. But because the place is always\
  \ smokey they can\u2019t use it at all.\n\nWhich does suck for them. I grew up in\
  \ an apartment in the area and I know how much it sucks not being able to go outside\
  \ to play because it\u2019s too dangerous, but I also know most of my tenants smoke\
  \ and I don\u2019t want them to feel put out as they\u2019ve been here for years.\
  \ I know they all work tough jobs and have different schedules everyday, so they\
  \ smoke to relax. Sometimes I do to."
