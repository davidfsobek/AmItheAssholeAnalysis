selftext: "My sister (I'll call her Holly) recently found out she is pregnant. Very\
  \ happy for her. Since she was little Holly has always wanted a big fairytale wedding.\
  \ Since that won't be easy with a baby taking up most of their time, her SO Tom\
  \ proposed to her, and they've set a date for a few months time. \n\nEveryone expected\
  \ me to be part of the bridal party. I spoke to my mum about it and said that I\
  \ wouldn't do it. She was very upset with me but I do have reasons. \n\nHolly and\
  \ I have differences. She's always loved being the centre of attention, and often\
  \ used to take it out on me when she didn't get her way. She's also mum and dad's\
  \ favourite for quite a few reasons. Both our parents are doctors, and while they\
  \ never forced us into anything, they both hoped we'd follow them. Holly is not\
  \ only a doctor, but she studied at Oxbridge, which they were hugely proud of. As\
  \ for me, I worked like a dog but just didn't have the academic talent and ended\
  \ up becoming a nurse instead. I love my job but I know they are disappointed that\
  \ I wasn't good enough to become a doctor. As well as that, she's always been the\
  \ pretty/girly sister. She got mum's good looks and is absolutely gorgeous, whereas\
  \ I'm average looking if I make an effort. \n\nThe reason I don't want to be a bridesmaid\
  \ is because I know what she's like. Weddings are stressful, and she'll take out\
  \ that stress by shrieking and screaming at me, calling me all kinds of shitty names.\
  \ Holly has been dreaming of this day since she was little, and with the sort of\
  \ tantrums she has over other things I don't want to put up with abuse whenever\
  \ something goes wrong for her perfect wedding. She's done this since we were little.\
  \ At her birthday parties she'd gang up on me with her friends. At mine she'd cry\
  \ about not being the centre of attention. To mum and dad she was always the victim\
  \ and I was always in the wrong. \n\nI talked to mum and she was really upset. She\
  \ said that it was awful of me to refuse to help my sister while she's pregnant.\
  \ I get that but surely pregnancy will make her tantrums worse rather than better?\
  \ She's already had a huge row with mum over who will pay for her dress, even though\
  \ she can afford it herself. Apparently Holly ended up screaming and swearing over\
  \ the phone and breaking down sobbing. \n\nMy boyfriend Sam doesn't think I'm in\
  \ the wrong, and understands why I wouldn't want to be in her bridal party. I just\
  \ don't think I can manage it."
