selftext: "I (21f) just had an argument with one of my good friends (20f). We\u2019\
  ll call her Julia. I\u2019ve known her almost my whole life and we ended up at the\
  \ same college. Julia\u2019s been in a pre-law program for the last two and a half\
  \ years. She was doing really well in her classes and preparing to take the LSAT\
  \ when she decided to quit the program and transfer into a history major next semester.\
  \ She basically has to restart college and will have to take out a very significant\
  \ amount of loans to cover all the time her scholarships won\u2019t.  Julia has\
  \ no planned direction for after graduation. She doesn\u2019t want to be a teacher\
  \ and will not go to graduate school/law school.\n\nI feel that Julia\u2019s throwing\
  \ away amazing opportunities for a bleak future, but I wasn\u2019t planning on telling\
  \ her my opinion. I kept quiet until she brought up the financial portion of her\
  \ decision. Julia said she knew she\u2019d be saddled with massive debt and would\
  \ probably be poor but thought that chasing her dreams mattered more. Julia knows\
  \ that I grew up really poor and chose my college major based on post-graduation\
  \ salary.  She, on the other hand, grew up wealthy.\n\nAt this point, I suggested\
  \ that she seriously reconsider her decision - or at the very least think of a plan\
  \ - because she has no idea what it\u2019s like to be poor. I told her that no amount\
  \ of fulfillment at a job would matter if she didn\u2019t have enough money to take\
  \ care of her basic needs. Julia seemed to be really hurt and told me I cared about\
  \ money too much. She said she was angry that I wasn't supporting her change. I\
  \ tried to politely explain my position but we both ended the conversation feeling\
  \ frustrated. We haven\u2019t spoken in over a week now.\n\nI feel bad for hurting\
  \ her feelings because she is a really good friend of mine and I want her to be\
  \ happy in her life after graduation.  Julia wasn't head-over-heels passionate about\
  \ her future career as a lawyer, but she would have been good at it and would have\
  \ made nice money doing it, which, to me, is just about as good as anyone can do.\
  \ I don't think it's wrong/bad for her to change paths, but I do think she\u2019\
  s naive to be so careless about money when she\u2019s never known life without it.\n\
  \nSo, Reddit, AITA for telling my friend to rethink the finances of her career path\
  \ change?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEditing to add: Julia only decided to change majors very\
  \ recently. She told me the switch was less about studying history and more about\
  \ not going to law school since she doesn't feel passionate about what she's currently\
  \ studying. When Julia expressed those thoughts earlier in the semester, I was vocally\
  \ supportive of her exploring a new path. Just over Thanksgiving, though, she seemed\
  \ sure she was staying in pre-law and was planning to schedule for pre-law classes\
  \ next semester. She just mentioned the change last week when we met up. Julia said\
  \ she wanted to talk to me about it since scheduling is coming up this Thursday.\
  \  She did meet up specifically to talk about it with me, so I'm not sure the advice\
  \ was unsolicited so much as surprising and maybe poorly delivered."
