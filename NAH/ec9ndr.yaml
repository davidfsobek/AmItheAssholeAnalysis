selftext: 'My husband and I went to the courthouse bc taxes, but we''re planning on
  having an actual wedding next year to celebrate with friends and family. My parents
  are divorced and I''ve lived full time with my mom and stepdad since I was 13. My
  dad isn''t a very good parent, but I don''t really harbor any resentment towards
  him. He''s struggled with depression and he''s never made me doubt how much he loves
  me, he just generally hasn''t been present and we don''t have a very close relationship
  at all. My mom and my stepdad are great parents, my stepdad taught me how to drive
  and helped me pay for college and he refers to me as his daughter. I refer to my
  mom and my stepdad as my "parents" but I don''t call him dad and he''s never asked
  me to. My mom and my dad do not get along at all, and for a long time I actually
  didn''t want to get married just because I was worried about family drama at my
  wedding, but I''ve since realized that that''s dumb and I should get to celebrate
  with my SO if that''s what we want.


  ANYWAY, I''ve always said that I would want my younger brother to walk me down the
  aisle, like even before I really wanted to get married. This for a few reasons,
  both to avoid any family drama (if my dad walked me down the aisle that would be
  shitty since my stepdad and mom put way more effort into actually parenting me,
  but it would hurt my dad''s feelings if I excluded him entirely), and because my
  bro and I are really close and have stuck together regardless of whatever else is
  going on. Obviously we fought when we were younger but in general we get along and
  support each other. Plus, my whole family has played a huge part in raising both
  of us, my grandparents and great grandparents on both sides have had a huge impact
  on who I am today, and I think since my bro is also a result of that support system
  it would be nice to symbolize that by having him walk me down the aisle when everyone
  is there to (hopefully) come together to celebrate despite that they generally don''t
  get along.


  When I told my mom this, she was originally very excited. Her brother also walked
  her down the aisle. But later on, she wanted to know why I didn''t ask my stepdad
  and was like "you know this is supposed to be about your parents giving you away,
  my brother only did it because I didn''t have a dad to do it". She just didn''t
  want to drop it and kept guilting me until I just stopped responding. My stepdad
  basically said that he will be there in whatever way I want him to be, but he definitely
  hasn''t been initiating conversation as much as usual since then, although he says
  he''s just stressed from work.


  I''m planning on doing a dance with my stepdad during the reception and have him
  do the traditional "father of the bride" toast but I haven''t talked to him about
  it yet because I''m worried he already feels rejected by me if that makes sense?
  Even though that wasn''t my intention. So AITA for asking my bro to walk me down
  the aisle even though my mom and stepdad have been great parents?'
