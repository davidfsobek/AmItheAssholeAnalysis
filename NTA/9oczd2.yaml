selftext: "So I live on a second floor of an apartment complex with my fianc\xE9 ,\
  \ my neighbor below us when we moved in, we offered our cell numbers to them several\
  \ times, in case we were ever too loud so they could hit us up to ask us to be quieter,\
  \ they declined each time. Now the rules with the apartment are \u2018 quiet hours\
  \ \u2018 are between 9 pm- 7am. After a week the neighbor tells us we walk too loud\
  \ and we need to stop at 8 pm because that\u2019s when he goes to bed for the night.\
  \ So we did our best to adjust for him, then yesterday about 5pm my fianc\xE9 and\
  \ I were going at it, and our neighbor below us bangs on his ceiling/our floor mid\
  \ fuck, which killed my SO\u2019s mood, so we stopped. Then about 5 mins later the\
  \ dude bangs on our door and yells at us that he doesn\u2019t wanna hear us fucking\
  \ and threatens to call the cops or apartment management if he ever hears us again.\
  \  \n  \nSo, am I the asshole here for getting down, or is he the asshole for losing\
  \ his shit and demanding us change our lives for him?  \n  \n  \nEdit: Holy crap,\
  \ I didn\u2019t expect this to blow up. I took some of your advice and reported\
  \ the situation to property management, they said they will speak to him about it.\
  \ Also starting soon we will be petty and fuck every single day, not extra loud\
  \ but normal sex, starting at 8pm and go until 859 pm. Thanks guys."
