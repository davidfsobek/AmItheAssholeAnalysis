  \ and took her iPad out and starts watching a show quite loud. \n\nTo me this is\
  \ a foul in public however I just ignored it and put my earbuds in. \n\nAfter a\
  \ while I made a phone call using my earbuds. Literally 30 seconds into my call\
  \ she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear\
  \ her show.\n\nI was as polite as I could and said that not only herself but everyone\
  \ for about 10 feet and I could hear her show word for word and that making a phone\
  \ call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting\
  \ area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. \n\nShe said\
  \ she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and\
  \ selfish phone call or having to use headphones. \n\nI said she was absolutely\
  \ right and I am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the\
  \ plane and I will do  the same.       I then proceeded to take out my iPad and\
  \ open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device\
  \ without my earbuds. \n\nI have never seen someone storm off so mad. \n\nQuick\
  \ edit. I turned the music video off almost immediately after she left. "
