selftext: "I fucking hate wedding culture.\n\nIt's bullshit.\n\nMy fiance and I thought\
  \ we would escape the bullshit and money by having a small thing. Well, family started\
  \ trying to throw money at us to make it bigger and more spectacular. We were surprised,\
  \ but it was a good surprise.\n\nThen the demands started coming out. They wanted\
  \ this, they wanted that, they wanted this person to come, these colors, dresses\
  \ can't do this, this person has to be flower girl, this person HAS to be a groomsman,\
  \ etc etc. Suddenly it didn't feel like our wedding, but an excuse for our families\
  \ to have a family reunion.\n\nWe put our foot down and said:\n\n>Thank you all\
  \ for your kindness and generosity when it comes to our wedding. Unfortunately,\
  \ it looks like we may not have been on the same page as the rest of you. When we\
  \ were offered money for this wedding, we did not realize it came with strings attached.\
  \ With so many requests and so many demands from people we didn't expect would think\
  \ they had a say in *our* wedding, we have decided to give everyone their money\
  \ back.   \n>  \n>Our understanding of what a gift is must be very different.  \n\
  >  \n>If you would like to give us money without strings attached or requests or\
  \ demands, we will gracefully accept it. But if you believe a gift should come with\
  \ stipulations, we must regretfully, and politely decline.\n\nThis has caused an\
  \ epic shitstorm. Such to the point where I have people saying they will never come\
  \ to our wedding (honestly, not the worse thing in the world), that we are spoiled,\
  \ we're assholes, etc etc etc. My parents are rather upset about it, but hers (who\
  \ never made any demands and gave us a small cash gift) said we did the right thing.\
  \ \n\nWe are halfway to canceling the whole party and just absconding into the wilderness\
  \ to do the wedding the way we want. \n\nAITA? (Are We?)"
title: AITA for telling my family that if they gift us money for our wedding, there
  will be no "strings attached" or we will politely decline it?
