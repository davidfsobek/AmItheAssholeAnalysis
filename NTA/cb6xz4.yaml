selftext: "When my daughter was 14, wife and I decided we would buy a car for her\
  \ to use on her 16th if she proved herself to be responsible, got good grades, etc.\
  \ There would be a \"contract\" of sorts to ensure we were all on the same page.\
  \ The stipulations were continuing good grades, good attitude, she could only bring\
  \ one friend with her somewhere (to begin with), we had to know where she was, and\
  \ the obvious two: don't drink & drive, and don't text and drive. \n\nWe made it\
  \ clear that **we** were buying the car, but it was for her to use. We got the car,\
  \ a 2012 Honda Civic. She has a summer job right now, it's summer break so she's\
  \ out doing stuff with her friends, etc. In a few months she will be off to college.\
  \ Everything was going swimmingly. Until someone on that NextDoor app started posting\
  \ pictures and videos of bad drivers in the area. And lo and behold, my daughter\
  \ was posted with her face down as she texted and rolled through a stop sign. Once\
  \ with her face down in her phone at a stoplight. I was livid. My wife was the one\
  \ who showed it to me. We found out there were more instances (from her Instagram\
  \ Stories) and we decided... no.\n\nWife and I up and sold the car. We didn't lose\
  \ very much in the process, except of course our daughter completely came unraveled.\
  \ It's so unfair, I didn't hurt anyone, everyone's doing it, how am I supposed to\
  \ get to work, what about when I go to college? Well, we said no, it's not unfair,\
  \ you hurt us by being a shitty, irresponsible driver, no, not everyone's doing\
  \ it, you can walk, ride your bike, or take the bus, and as for college, you don't\
  \ need the car to get to and from classes, and again, ride your bike or walk. She\
  \ tried to play the \"how can you send your daughter to college without her safety\
  \ in mind?\" card and I said \"Well, well, well, now you're concerned about safety?\"\
  \ and she just up and screamed. \n\nThis has everyone in our life up in arms and\
  \ divided. Her grandparents think we're being over the top and awful, that grounding\
  \ her would have sufficed. They've threatened that THEY will buy her a car again\
  \ if we try to send her to college without one. \n\nThe car is already sold, so\
  \ there's no going back. I think what we did was absolutely correct, that actions\
  \ have consequences and we would be in the wrong to pull back from that. In terms\
  \ of her going to college? Well, she made that choice. She had a car, it came with\
  \ certain stipulations, she disobeyed us, and now she pays the price. \n\nSo AITA?"
