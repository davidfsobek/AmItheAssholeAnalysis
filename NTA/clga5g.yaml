selftext: "I (F20) recently had to move back in with my dad, step-mum and 2 of my\
  \ step-brothers (15 and 17). \n\nThe last time I lived here was 2-3 years ago. Back\
  \ then I remember getting very pissed off when my step-mum asked me to stop using\
  \ the bin in the toilet to put my waste sanitary products and use the one in my\
  \ room (on the other side of the house) because she didn\u2019t want her boys to\
  \ see it. \n\nNow it\u2019s not like I was leaving used tampons and pads out in\
  \ the open, everything was and still is, wrapped up so no blood is on show. \n\n\
  Anyway I never stopped using the toilet bin. \n\nNow I\u2019m back she\u2019s started\
  \ a new thing. Moving my small zip up bag full of my sanity products, that I keep\
  \ next to the toilet, and slightly open (for easy access), when I\u2019m on my period,\
  \ to under the sink zipped up. \n\nI personally think I absolutely should not be\
  \ hiding the fact I have a vagina and it bleeds. Her boys will grow up thinking\
  \ it\u2019s gross and something that needs to be hidden. I would just feel sorry\
  \ for the girls they end up with. And I just want to be comfortable in the house\
  \ I\u2019m living in.\n\nEdit: for more info, this isn\u2019t a random house I\u2019\
  ve moved back into. I\u2019ve lived here since I was 3 before my parents got divorced\
  \ when I was 7. My step mum and her kids moved in when I was 12(ish). I moved out\
  \ at 17-18 for multiple reasons. \n\nSo this is just as much my house as it is hers,\
  \ arguably more."
