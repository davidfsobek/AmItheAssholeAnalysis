selftext: "The title sounds so stupid but here we go anyways.\n\nI\u2019m 24 and I\u2019\
  m an addict who has been in recovery for the past six months. \n\nI used and used\
  \ until I was basically in poverty and my older sister helped bail me out more than\
  \ once. \n\nShe\u2019s my best friend and I know it hurt her a lot to see me like\
  \ that. \n\nShe also met her fianc\xE9 two years ago and he really only knew me\
  \ as the junkie brother then. He\u2019s not my biggest fan to say the least considering\
  \ how much I put my sister through. \n\nDespite this she still invited me to her\
  \ wedding last week because I am her brother and she wanted me to be there. \n\n\
  When I get to the reception, my brother in law is greeting people as they walk in.\
  \ \n\nWhen I walk by he pulls me to the side and in front of everyone starts patting\
  \ me down and says that he needs to check me to make sure I \u201Cdidn\u2019t bring\
  \ anything in\u201D.  I instinctively pull away, because why wouldn\u2019t I, and\
  \ I tell him not to touch me. \n\nHe tells me to \u201Ccalm down\u201D and that\
  \ if I want to be here then he needs to do this. I tell him he\u2019s being ridiculous\
  \ and I try to push past him. He stops me and tells me that he doesn\u2019t want\
  \ to throw me out but he \u201Cwill if he has to.\u201D I told him that he\u2019\
  s trying to look tough but it\u2019s just making him look stupid. \n\nAt this point\
  \ I\u2019m getting more and more angry and I\u2019m practically yelling in his face\
  \ at this point. Bystanders came between us and separated us and told my BIL to\
  \ just \u201Cdrop it.\u201D He said he would but that \u201Cthey can deal with it\
  \ when I get out of hand.\u201D\n\nI just went to go find a seat after that. \n\n\
  After the reception, a lot of my family told me that I should\u2019ve let him just\
  \ do it and that I was acting like a huge asshole and like I had \u201Csomething\
  \ to hide.\u201D \n\nI don\u2019t think he had any right to pat me down, especially\
  \ in front of people and I don\u2019t think my reaction was over the top. If anything,\
  \ he was the one acting like a huge douche by trying to start drama so he can look\
  \ tough. My sister has refused to take any sides in this. \n\nAITA?"
