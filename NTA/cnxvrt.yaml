selftext: "I have a wife (Wilhelma, 40) and two sons (Sam, 17, and Scott, 16).  6\
  \ years ago, I ran to the gas station to buy some cigarettes.  Instead of abandoning\
  \ my family (just a joke) I decided to also buy a lottery ticket for everyone, just\
  \ for fun.  It was a blast.  We all talked all night about what we would do with\
  \ our winnings, where we would go, etc.  I mean, this was all fantasy anyway, right?\
  \  But I specifically told my kids that they would have to share their winnings,\
  \ and they would have to put it away for college first and foremost.  Well wouldn't\
  \ you know it, Sams ticket won.  Of course its actually MY ticket, and I had to\
  \ claim it.  It didn't win the jackpot, but after taxes we walked away with $60k.\
  \  I sat them both down and explained that I was going to save it all for college,\
  \ but we could celebrate/splurge a little.  They absolutely wanted a gaming system,\
  \ and Wilhelma insisted on a family vacation that was much needed.  We all agreed\
  \ on this, and saving the rest.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI bought the gaming system and a\
  \ bunch of games for about $1k.  Wilhelma took over the vacation and insisted on\
  \ a Disney World trip.  The boys don't even like Disney, but it was always Wilhelma's\
  \ dream to go so we went.  Another $5k.  Last year, Sam wanted a car.  Wilhelma\
  \ was pretty tired of chauffeuring them around anyway, so I agreed and spent \"\
  his\" $4k on a car.  I pay the insurance, registration, and maintenance under the\
  \ agreement that he takes over driving Scott to his stuff as well.  Wilhelma had\
  \ no complaints about any of these purchases.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince day 1, I've\
  \ actually invested the entire winnings and never dipped into it.  I've always spent\
  \ my OWN money on all this stuff.  I have invested better than average, and that\
  \ $60k is now $100k.  Wilhelma knows I have always invested our money, but it was\
  \ always small amounts since we're poor.  She knows I was investing the lottery\
  \ winnings as well.  I've always told her about the money doing well, but I guess\
  \ I never explicitly said how well.  She also has never asked, as she has left our\
  \ finances completely up to me.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSam is starting college in a few\
  \ weeks, and we figured out a plan to stretch his $30k over the 4 years.  While\
  \ looking at the portfolio, Wilhelma noticed it was at $100k and asked how.  I told\
  \ her I invested the $60k and grew it to $100k.  She then asked why we're only giving\
  \ Sam $30K when it should be $50k.  I said no, the other $40k is mine.  I managed\
  \ this account, I made the investments, I did all of the work.  Plus I paid for\
  \ all that other stuff through our other savings. The $40k stays and I'll keep investing\
  \ it.  If the boys NEED the money, its there, but if not I'm gonna eventually retire\
  \ a little early with it.  She thinks I'm stealing \"his\" money since I wouldn't\
  \ have been able to invest with it if I didn't have it to begin with.  I say its\
  \ always kinda been my money, and I'm still giving him the $30k I promised him since\
  \ the beginning."
