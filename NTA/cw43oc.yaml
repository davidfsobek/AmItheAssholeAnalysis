selftext: "Hi all. \n\nI gave birth four weeks ago, and we decided to have a ''baby\
  \ ceremony'', where everyone gets to meet our lovely daughter Charlotte. \n\nMy\
  \ cousin Alice and her parents were among the guests. The first thing I'll say about\
  \ her is that she has expensive taste. She's the sort of person who has a *minimum*\
  \ price range for how much she spends on clothing. She doesn't own anything that\
  \ isn't designer and has some items of clothing that cost thousands. She is a banker\
  \ and still lives with parents so can afford the lifestyle. \n\nIt was Alice's turn\
  \ to hold the baby and she was happy to at first, but suddenly Charlotte vomited\
  \ on her. Alice handed Charlotte back to me and ran off crying, and spent the rest\
  \ of the event crying in the car. I went to see her to apologise but she didn't\
  \ want to hear any of it. My mum gave her one of her shirts which was too big for\
  \ her and she felt completely upset and humiliated.\n\nToday I got a call from my\
  \ mum, saying that she'd been on the phone to her sister (Alice's mum) saying that\
  \ they want me to reimburse the cost of the blouse (roughly \xA31800) since it was\
  \ completely ruined. \n\nI have said no. At the end of the day we all know what\
  \ babies can be like. She took a risk wearing something so expensive knowing a baby\
  \ was nearby and unfortunately it backfired. I feel bad for her but it was not my\
  \ fault. \n\nAm I doing the right thing by refusing to pay up?"
