selftext: "tl;dr at bottom\n\nOkay so I\u2019m almost 19.\n\nWhen my paternal uncle\
  \ was around 22, he got his girlfriend pregnant, but they had an abortion. They\
  \ got married later on, converted to Christianity and became pro-life advocates,\
  \ and had two daughters, who are currently 26 and 23. \n\nI know about the abortion\
  \ part because my dad told me a couple years back. He didn\u2019t say not to tell\
  \ anyone, but said that only him, his brother, and his wife know of it. I thought\
  \ it\u2019s weird they never told their daughters, given that they\u2019re all such\
  \ protestors against abortion.\n\nBut anyways dad also has a sister, who\u2019s\
  \ daughter I\u2019m really close with. She\u2019s Christian like the rest of us,\
  \ but she got pregnant out of wedlock and had a baby last May. Then her boyfriend\
  \ left her over it. I absolutely adore her baby, and I try to help raise him given\
  \ that he doesn\u2019t have a father.\n\nI\u2019m usually on good terms with my\
  \ aforementioned uncle\u2019s daughters, and I was messaging them three way last\
  \ night. I was sending a bunch of cheery pictures and messages of the baby, and\
  \ eventually they asked why I would celebrate him so much given that he was created\
  \ in sin.\n\nI told them our cousin has prayed for forgiveness and that everyone\
  \ makes mistakes. But they overrode me, saying that she\u2019s easy and shouldn\u2019\
  t have spread her legs blah blah blah. It went on for a few more messages.\n\nI\
  \ got really frustrated at one point and in a fit of rage said \n\n\u201CYeah I\
  \ hate to break it to you ladies but your parents got pregnant and had an abortion\
  \ all outside of marriage way back when. Everyone makes mistakes and our cousin\
  \ is trying to make the best of a bad situation, so lighten up.\u201D\n\nThree hours\
  \ later and there was still no response; I knew I was in deep shit.\n\nAnd I was!\
  \ My parents yelled at me, grounded me, and took away my electronics last night,\
  \ meaning I\u2019m using my old old old phone right now. They were very tense with\
  \ me today. I was very earnest. \n\nI always like posting online where no one can\
  \ physically judge me, so thus I ask, AITA for telling my cousins the truth about\
  \ their parents?\n\ntl;dr: uncle and aunt got abortion way back when, told unbeknownst\
  \ cousins about it when they judged our cousin for having baby out of wedlock, parents\
  \ mad at me. AITA?"
