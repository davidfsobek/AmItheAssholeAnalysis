selftext: "I\u2019m(22M) a legal guardian of my 15 year old brother. We\u2019re very\
  \ close and we have always been like that. He lives with me now obviously. He often\
  \ gets really sad, we recently lost our parents, so I comfort him as best as I can.\
  \ \n\nSo, about my girlfriend, we have been together for 2 years. She doesn\u2019\
  t live with me, she stays over really often tho, so she has the house keys.\n\n\
  2 days ago, she came over without warning me. Me and my brother were asleep on couch,\
  \ he wasn\u2019t wearing a shirt because it was hot, and he was laying on top of\
  \ me. She woke us up and made a scene in front of him. She said that our relationship\
  \ was weird and disgusting and it\u2019s extremely concerning that he\u2019s so\
  \ affectionate towards me. My brother was in tears and he even apologized to her.\
  \ I brought him to his room and calmed him down. \n\nI went back to living room,\
  \ she was sitting on couch, watching tv and acting like nothing happened. I told\
  \ her to get the fuck out. She got defensive again and said that she was just stating\
  \ her opinion without hurting anyone. I grabbed her wrist and brought her to door.\
  \ I didn\u2019t hurt her, she was following me, I didn\u2019t use any force. She\
  \ left, she called me few times but I didn\u2019t answer.\n\n\nUpdate: thanks for\
  \ all the comments. I talked to her, she still said that she didn\u2019t do anything\
  \ wrong,she didn\u2019t hurt my brother and it wasn\u2019t her fault that he started\
  \ crying. I broke up with her. \n\nAlso little info: this doesn\u2019t happen often,\
  \ we were on couch, watching tv and fell asleep. He laid on top of me after he fell\
  \ asleep, he moves around a lot while sleeping."
