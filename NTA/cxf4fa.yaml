selftext: 'So this didn''t happen recently, but it was brought up last night and my
  boyfriend seemed to get really mad about it, so I figured I would bring it to the
  group to see if I''m the asshole or not.


  My boyfriend has terrible time management skills and is late for everything.  I
  absolutely hate it because I am the kind of person that believes if you''re not
  10 minutes early, you''re late.


  For an example, we were invited to a family lunch a few years ago.  Everyone was
  meeting at a restaurant at 11:00am.  We live 10 minutes from said restaurant and
  my boyfriend waited until 10:55 before getting in the shower or attempting getting
  ready.  We were an hour late meeting the family, who was already well into the meal
  when we arrived.


  A few months went by and another family gathering invite was sent out, with a ''start
  time'' of 1:00pm.  Knowing that he is terrible at getting ready and leaving on time,
  I told my boyfriend that the event started at Noon, not 1:00.  And just as I figured
  at just before noon, my boyfriend started to get ready.  We show up at 1:00, him
  thinking we''re now an hour late, only to find out that everyone else is just getting
  there too.


  So last night we got to discussing things and it got brought up how  I had lied
  about what time the event started.  I know it''s a shitty thing to lie and he pointed
  out, if I can lie about something like that, whose to say what else I''d be lying
  about.  I told him he was right to feel like that, but reminded him that I don''t
  have locks on my phone and he knows the passwords/pin numbers to all my accounts
  so he''s more than welcome to check and see if I''m ''hiding something''.  I explained
  that I only did it because he has terrible time management skills and can''t seem
  to be anywhere on time.  In my opinion, being repeatedly late to things is rude
  and it''s a terrible skill to be teaching his children.


  He doesn''t have any kind of problems with his family, so there is no reason that
  he would want to limit his time with them and it''s not like these gatherings are
  boring/unfun events (the one I lied about the start time was actually a family paintball
  game, which we love to play).


  I''ve learned my lesson and don''t plan on doing it again in the future, but I just
  have to know if I''m the asshole for lying to try and get him to be on time for
  something that is important to me.



  Edit:  So I posted this before I left for work when there was only a handful of
  comments and wasnt able to check it all day.  I certainly didn''t expect it to get
  this much attention, let alone 20,000 upvotes.


  Though I haven''t yet gotten a chance to read through or reply to any messages or
  comments yet, I''d like to thank everyone for their judgements.  Whether you think
  I''m an asshole or not, you took time out of your life to try to explain your point
  of view of the situation and I appreciate that.'
