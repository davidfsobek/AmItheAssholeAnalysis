selftext: "I am 19F, have a little brother who is 8, and living with my parents at\
  \ the moment. I am still studying so I cannot pay rent yet, but I do earn my own\
  \ pocket money from part-time jobs.\n\n\nMy father's 3 brothers and their family\
  \ came to our town for a vacation for 3 days over the weekend. They have not met\
  \ for years so it's their big gathering and they had been planning for a long time.\
  \ That plan seemed to have the members split into 2 groups - the adults and the\
  \ kids. I had been arranged to join the kids' group, when I tried to protest they\
  \ insist that I am a \"kid\" too, so I just had to submit to my fate. Clearly they\
  \ all just wanted a babysitter for their 5 kids(age 5-10) while they \"adults\"\
  \ get out and enjoy their reunion.\n\n\nSo I spent the weekend babysitting a total\
  \ of 5 kids. That includes organizing games at home to entertain them, bring them\
  \ to Science Park and the likes for outings and food and just overall watch over\
  \ their safety and be an \"adult\" when needed. To be honest it was quite fun, though\
  \ tiring when I sometimes had to raise my voice to make myself heard and drag the\
  \ younger ones back when they stray too far(I admit, I am not really babysitter\
  \ material). The kids seem to like me, so I guess it went well too. However, I still\
  \ would rather be either hanging out with other adults or just having my weekend\
  \ to my own. \n\n\nWhen my 3 uncles' families' were leaving after the weekend, they\
  \ gave pocket money to each of the kids, including my brother, my father also gave\
  \ pocket money to each of my cousins. Almost as expected, there wasn't a share for\
  \ me. Now, I don't really care about the pocket money, they are just a couple of\
  \ notes I can easily earn in a few hours, but I am rather annoyed for the fact that\
  \ conveniently, I was skipped for being an \"adult\" this time.\n\n\nI put on the\
  \ biggest smile I and asked politely for pocket money from my uncles and aunt-in\
  \ laws. They were a little taken aback. I said as sweetly as I could that I deserve\
  \ pocket money too for being a \"kid\", they said so themselves. In all awkwardness\
  \ I got my pocket money. Needless to say, my parents looked like they had shit smeared\
  \ across their faces.\n\n\nI got the biggest shit from my parents after they left.\
  \ In their words, I am a major AH to have deliberately made my parents lose face,\
  \ and so on and so forth. AITA?"
