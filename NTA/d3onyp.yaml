selftext: "I was recently on a long (3+ hour) flight.  When we got airborne, the woman\
  \ in front of me reclined her seat back, pressing them down on my kneecaps.  I am\
  \ a tall person (6'5\") and generally don't fit into coach seats easily. I couldn't\
  \ even put my tray down.  Leaning my seat back doesn't really help. I wrangled myself\
  \ out of my seat and asked her politely, \"I'm sorry ma'am, but I wonder if I could\
  \ impose on you and ask to please raise your seat up just a few inches?  I don't\
  \ have much space back there and with your seat pressing on my kneecaps, neither\
  \ of us will be very comfortable during this long flight.  Thank you.\"  She just\
  \ looked at me blankly, said \"No\", and closed her eyes.  I walked to the front\
  \ of the plane and explained my situation to the flight attendant, who went back\
  \ and spoke to the woman, who then reluctantly raised the seat up a bit.  When I\
  \ got back into my seat, the woman turned around and hissed \"Asshole\" at me. \
  \ \nAITA? Should I have just kept my mouth closed and sucked up for the remainder\
  \ of the flight?\n\nEDIT: I normally book the seats with extra room, but this was\
  \ a last-minute business trip and all the extra-room seats were already booked."
title: AITA for telling the flight attendant to ask the woman in front of me to raise
  her seat up because it was pressing on my legs?
