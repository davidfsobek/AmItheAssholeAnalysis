selftext: "Long time lurker, here is my first post!\n\nSo I (F16) was on a flight\
  \ from Dubai to new York, so it was quite a long trip. Usually we are upgraded to\
  \ business class on this airline since our dad is a pilot, but because my brother\u2019\
  s friend couldn\u2019t afford the seat, we decided to stay in economy. Our mother\
  \ was sitting in business class so she wasn\u2019t present during this whole situation.\n\
  \nWhen we got on the plane, my twin brother and his friend, 16 and 15, were in the\
  \ row in front of me, my brother in the window seat and his friend in the aisle.\
  \ I was sitting right behind his friend in the aisle seat.\n\nThen his woman got\
  \ on, she was wearing a hijab, so it was obvious that she was a muslim. I saw her\
  \ looking very uncomfortable when she saw my brother and his friend, knowing that\
  \ she had the middle seat. \n\nI wasn\u2019t paying attention but I took off my\
  \ headphones when I heard my brother\u2019s friend say no to the lady. She then\
  \ said: \u201CIt is against my religion to touch men in public\u201D and my brother\
  \ said,\n\n\u201CBut we\u2019re not touching you.\u201D\n\nShe looked very angry\
  \ and was almost yelling at my brother\u2019s friend to move to the middle seat\
  \ so she could have the aisle. I thought she was so entitled, so I told them,\n\n\
  \u201CDon\u2019t move. Just ignore her.\u201D\n\nShe then proceeded to ask me if\
  \ I knew them, so I said yes. She asked to switch with me. So this is what I said,\n\
  \n\u201CNo. I don\u2019t want the middle seat because I\u2019m very claustrophobic\
  \ (I\u2019m not, I just prefer the aisle seat so I can stretch my legs)\u201D and\
  \ she said, \n\n\u201Cthat\u2019s not my problem.\u201D\n\nThat\u2019s when I got\
  \ really pissed and I said it,\n\n\u201CYour religion is not our problem. Should\u2019\
  ve chosen better seats then\u201D \n\nThen she stomped her foot and went to the\
  \ flight attendant, and that\u2019s the last we saw of her. I\u2019m guessing they\
  \ moved her to another empty seat. \n\nWhen we got back from the trip, my brother\u2019\
  s friend told me he was going to move and I wasn\u2019t right to attack her religion\
  \ like that.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nEDIT: This was around six months ago. For those\
  \ saying that it affected my father\u2019s career, he confirmed that it didn\u2019\
  t. Also his judgement was NTA!\n\nEDIT 2: Wow this blew up! Thanks for the judgement\
  \ guys, whether it was YTA, NTA, or ESH, thank you for taking the time of your day\
  \ to help me become a better person."
