selftext: "About two months ago, my husband and I got \u201Cmarried\u201D in a beautiful\
  \ ceremony. It was SO MUCH FUN. We went on a honeymoon after. The price tag makes\
  \ me wheeze, but my parents were insistent on paying for 95% of it, saying it\u2019\
  s their only daughter\u2019s wedding. As a result, the wedding was way more fancy\
  \ than something my husband or I could afford! My husband and I paid the rest \u2014\
  \ his family did not contribute (which is fine!). \n\nThe wedding was lovely, but\
  \ missing one piece - the marriage license. About a year and a half ago, I was going\
  \ through some serious health issues (the issues are resolved now, thankfully!).\
  \ I had recently graduated from school and didn\u2019t have health insurance. My\
  \ husband and I decided to get married so I could join his health insurance. It\
  \ was a quick Justice of the Peace ceremony. We were always planning to have a ceremony\
  \ at some point in the future. A few months after that, he \u201Cproposed\u201D\
  \ (something I didn\u2019t see coming!), the wedding occurred, and here we are today,\
  \ planning for kids. \n\nVery few people knew we got legally married about a year\
  \ and a half ago. We weren\u2019t trying to be deceptive. However, part of it was\
  \ that I wasn\u2019t comfortable revealing my health issues. My husband respected\
  \ this. My parents knew about our legal marriage, but his mother did not. His mom\
  \ (I\u2019ll call her Carol) and I aren\u2019t close. She\u2019s fine enough in\
  \ low doses, but...\n\nWe\u2019re currently in the process of moving. This past\
  \ weekend, his mother came to help us pack up things. As we were packing files (birth\
  \ certificate, social security cards, etc.), somehow our marriage license must\u2019\
  ve slipped out. Carol picked it up and kept insisting we need to frame it. And then\
  \ she noticed the date. \n\nCarol lost it. She insisted we lied to everyone. She\
  \ said our wedding ceremony was just a \u201Cgift grab\u201D (our wedding website\
  \ stated that someone\u2019s presence was gift enough\u2014 we still got many generous\
  \ gifts and we are forever grateful). Carol went and called her twin sister, my\
  \ husband\u2019s aunt, and the sister called and lashed out at us. She said we were\
  \ sneaky and deceptive. She is saying she may want her gift back\u2014something\
  \ we are fine with giving her. \n\nFor me and my husband, the legal wedding was\
  \ just so I could get insurance. A means to an end. Our wedding date is what we\
  \ will celebrate. Are we assholes for not being more upfront? I\u2019ve been really\
  \ upset and confused and waffle back and forth. My husband insists we are not assholes."
