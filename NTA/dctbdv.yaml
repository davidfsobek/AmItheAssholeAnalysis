selftext: "So this happened about a year ago but I'm curious. My wife said I drug\
  \ it out too far and was an asshole. \n\nSo my kid comes homes from school telling\
  \ me he learned something new at school, and he was excited. So I was excited too\
  \ and asked him what. He said \"we learned our blood is blue today!\". \n\nI felt\
  \ a little bad but said to him \"you know I was told that as a kid too, but I've\
  \ learned that's actually not true.\". I said I can show him evidence from the internet\
  \ when we get home. We get home and I show him and he believes me. \n\nThe next\
  \ day he goes to school and tells his friends and even the teacher that that was\
  \ incorrect. His teacher tells him no, I am the one who is wrong not him. My kid\
  \ even said he believes his teacher. So I show my son more proof that I am right,\
  \ but he is still skeptical.  \n\nThe next day I compose a nice email, not rude.\
  \ Simply stating I told my son we didn't have blue blood and he told me that you\
  \ told him I am incorrect. I give him some links showing we don't have blue blood.\
  \  \n\nHe emails me back saying I am still incorrect. At this point my wife asks\
  \ me to drop it. I am upset and I don't want to drop it. As of now my own kid does\
  \ not believe me, even after showing him proof. \n\nSo I email the teacher again\
  \ and ask him if he can provide me evidence that he is correct because I cannot\
  \ produce anything showing he is correct. He finally relents and says I must be\
  \ right. \n\nBut at this point, I now need him to tell my son he was incorrect so\
  \ my son will believe me.  My wife asked me to please stop but I didn't. I emailed\
  \ him asking him to please tell my son and the classroom that he was incorrect so\
  \ they don't go through life with incorrect information. \n\nHe did tell the kids\
  \ he was wrong and that's the end of that. \n\nNow I feel that I have taught my\
  \ son a few good lessons.  A) it's ok to question things including those authorities\
  \ B) it's ok to stand behind what your beliefs are especially with evidence C) it's\
  \ ok to be wrong(the teacher) we can all be wrong, but when presented with proof,\
  \ it's ok to change your opinion based on evidence.\n\nWas I an asshole for dragging\
  \ it out?\n\nEdit. To those calling me an asshole? What is the best way to handle\
  \ this then? I'm serious, genuinely curious of the proper way to handle this?\n\n\
  Edit: well this blew up. I'll accept my nta. But these people telling me my reasons\
  \ for doing this are self centered? Nope. Couldn't care less. But I wanted my kid\
  \ to challenge authority, absolutely, and to stand by your convictions.\n\nFinal\
  \ edit: showed the wife this. She said that I was correct in following through.\
  \ But I was the asshole because she had to listen to me complain about this guy\
  \ at home for days. \nThanks for the conversations though!"
