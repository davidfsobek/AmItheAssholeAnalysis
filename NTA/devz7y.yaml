selftext: "Throwaway for anonymity sake incase this does go further. \n\nTo preface\
  \ this, I (24F) am vegan, and have been for a good 10 years. I have not eaten meat\
  \ since I was roughly 3-4 years old when I found out where meat comes from (spoiler\
  \ alert: there were a lot of tears). This is no secret and everyone in my life knows\
  \ and respects this - or so I thought. \n\n\nFour nights ago, I was at a party and\
  \ I will admit, I got white girl wasted. My friends thought it would be funny to\
  \ feed me chicken nuggets as a prank. I checked with them before chowing down \"\
  are these vegan?\" To which my friends replied \"yeah, they're sunfed\" (a type\
  \ of vegan chickenless chicken). They tasted off to me but I figured it was just\
  \ because I was drunk. I was wrong. \n\nI found out the next day when my sister\
  \ sent me a message telling me to check my friends Snapchat story. The story was\
  \ them showing the nugget packaging, and then showing them giving them to me (including\
  \ the conversation where I asked if it was vegan). The and then later them mocking\
  \ me and pretending to be me when I found out I ate meat (things like fake crying\
  \ and yelling \"the CHICKENS!!!\"). I took a screen recording of the video and took\
  \ it to the police, on the grounds of food tampering, and now 3 of my (ex) friends\
  \ are facing charges. \n\nThey all think that I'm overreacting to a 'harmless' prank,\
  \ so Reddit, AITA? In my view, they took advantage of my drunken state, tampered\
  \ with my food, and publically humiliated me. In their view, it was just a prank."
