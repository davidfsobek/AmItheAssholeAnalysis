selftext: 'When I (22F) was 11, the family dog died. I was very sad and repeatedly
  asked my parents to get a new one. They finally agreed, on the condition that I''d
  be responsible for it and take care of it. That''s how I got Mickey, the cutest
  Cocker Spaniel and best boy ever.


  I did take care of him. I took him for a walk every day. Started spending my own
  money to buy him food. I was so motivated with the whole dog caring thing, I even
  read books and magazines on how to properly educate it. They made a big point of
  feeding it properly and not spoiling it with human food, so I tried to stick to
  dog food.


  But my mom (53F) would still give him "treats" which consisted of pretty much anything
  she was eating, including sweets, chocolate and cookies. Throughout the years I
  confronted her about it but she''d just brush it off every time. I tried to buy
  her "good" treats, actual dog snacks, that she could feed him, but she continued
  to feed it junk.


  Over the years, Mickey started gaining weight. He refused to eat proper dog food,
  eating only my mom''s junk food. He also grew very attached to her, mostly because
  she spent all day at home with him and fed him. I was still the one taking him on
  walks (not once did my mom do it), playing with him at the park, but he seemed to
  prefer her company to mine. She''d even make snide remarks about how he''d "chosen
  her as his mommy" and "liked her better". This only increased my resentment towards
  my mom.


  Fast forward a few years, I had to move away for college. I reluctantly agreed to
  leave Mickey with my parents. His health started to decline even more. My mom didn''t
  take him out at all, and without me to control her, he grew even more obese. Every
  time I visited I''d see the poor thing getting worse and just looking sad and it''d
  break my heart.


  This has been going on for four years. Mickey is now eleven years old, half blind
  and with very limited mobility. Last week, he started vomiting blood. My parents
  took him to the vet and found it''s going to need surgery to survive.


  That surgery''s going to cost roughly $2000. My mom doesn''t have the necessary
  funds and asked me to cover it. I told her I can''t do it. I do have the money,
  but it''s nearly all of my savings which I need for myself. I love Mickey, but I
  can''t justify spending all my money, specially when his health is so poor and he''ll
  probably die from something else soon anyway.


  Upon hearing this, my mom accused me of being heartless and "basically killing the
  dog". She said I''m the reason she bought Mickey in the first place, and reminded
  me of my promise to care for him. I told her she''s the reason he''s dying, and
  that she''s been poisoning him for years.


  Later my dad called, told me I''m being unfair, that even if my mom hasn''t cared
  properly for the dog, it''s wrong to let him die "just to punish her". The dog''s
  life is more valuable than an "I told you so" to my mom. He asked me to reconsider.
  I still said no, but now I feel really conflicted. So Reddit, AITA?'
