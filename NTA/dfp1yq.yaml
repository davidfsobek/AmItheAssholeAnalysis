selftext: 'I''m 26M, my sister is 28F. We''re the only family we both have, neither
  of our parents are with us anymore and we have no aunts, uncles, or cousins. I''m
  single, so is my sister: she''s a single mother of a 3 year old. Despite all of
  this, we''re not particularly close. We live in the same city but I might see her
  once a year in passing.


  To make a long and convoluted post short, last week she came to my house and offloaded
  her son to me. She said she had to go to the hospital for mental health and I was
  the only person who could help. I couldn''t even protest, she didn''t even come
  inside. She took him in the car seat, put him on my porch, rang the bell, and told
  me all of this as she''s walking back to her car. She left no diapers, no supplies,
  no nothing, not even a word of when she''ll be back.


  It took me less than four hours to contact police and have child services involved.
  He was basically abandoned with me, or at least that was my thoughts. They took
  the child away and my sister is still in the hospital. I have no way of contacting
  her, nor has she tried to contact me. I can''t imagine the hellstorm that''s going
  to be unleashed when she''s out.


  I''m just not equipped to handle a kid. My home isn''t child proof, I have no friends
  who could babysit for a stranger, even as a favor. I work full time, I''m in school.
  I couldn''t think of any alternative besides getting child services involved. I
  feel like I let my sister down but first and foremost I believe she let her own
  child down. I don''t know what''s going to happen.


  Was I the asshole?


  **edit**: just so there''s more info, I wasn''t even left the base the car seat
  latches into. Never mind I don''t even have a car. I''ll admit I could have asked
  a friend for help picking up children stuff but that doesn''t address anything else.


  Child services is what its name implies, here where I live it''s called FACS. They
  work with families in struggling times like this. I told them my sister''s name,
  the hospital she''s at, and they presumably are working with her to sort this out.
  They left contact information but they won''t disclose any status to me because
  I''m not the parent. Even just the status of my sister, they weren''t at liberty
  to say.


  I didn''t "put the kid up for adoption" it doesn''t work like that. I contacted
  this agency who is trained to help in situations like this, where living arrangements
  are difficult or impossible for a child. My best guess is they have him in a foster
  home for now until my sister''s out. I don''t know anything else beyond my best
  guess.


  And I can''t just take time off work or school to care for a child 24/7 when agencies
  like the one I contacted can offload the work for me. It''s been 8 days and no word
  on anything: if I took eight days off work with no telling when I could return,
  I might as well not return.'

  me to babysit due to mental health?
