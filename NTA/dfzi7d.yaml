selftext: "My stepson is turning 18 soon and my husband and I decided that we will\
  \ be getting him a car. I make more than my husband does and we will be splitting\
  \ the cost of the car 70/30. That\u2019s fine with me.\n\nHis mother is a woman\
  \ who I make the effort to be civil with but don\u2019t like. I am much younger\
  \ than she and my husband are, and come from a more privileged background; she had\
  \ a lot of things to say about that. She called me her ex\u2019s cash cow and that\u2019\
  s one of the better things she said about me. We are not friends and I won\u2019\
  t even describe her as nice to me.\n\nWhen my husband told her that we will buy\
  \ my stepson a car for his birthday, she said she wants to chip in 5% of the cost\
  \ and then we could tell my stepson that the gift is from all of his parents and\
  \ step parents. \n\nI don\u2019t want to do that. I don\u2019t need her 5% and my\
  \ stepson knows that his mom and step dad are not in a position to equally share\
  \ the cost of buying the car. I don\u2019t want recognition for paying 70% of his\
  \ gift\u2019s cost but I don\u2019t want to share my and my husband\u2019s gift\
  \ to my stepson with a woman who has always been antagonistic to me.\n\nI don\u2019\
  t know why she wants us to gift the car jointly now because we\u2019ve never given\
  \ my stepson a gift jointly before. And I don\u2019t understand what\u2019s so bad\
  \ about getting separate gifts from me and his dad, and his mom and his stepdad.\n\
  \nI know that many people will say that it\u2019s better for my stepson to see that\
  \ all his parents and step parents are getting along. I\u2019m civil to his mom\
  \ and I never talk negatively about her to him. Is that not enough? Am I incapable\
  \ of being a good step mother to him if I\u2019m not best friends with his mom?\
  \ Do I have to let his mom get her way whenever she asks in the name of all parents\
  \ getting along?"

  \ mother wants to chip in and say that the car is from all of us, but I don\u2019\
  t want to do that."
