selftext: "I'm M23 my gf is F21 and we've been together for about 2 years now. Now\
  \ I come from a very middle class family, dads a blue collar worker and mom has\
  \ been working since I was a kid as well. My GF's family is filthy rich and even\
  \ she'll admit she's spoiled, everything paid for and a 3k a month allowance. Because\
  \ of this she's never had a job, doesn't care about school really (She's doing fine\
  \ though but in a easy program), or about having to make money in the future. My\
  \ car broke down recently and I've been taking the bus/subway to work and she's\
  \ been razzing me about it saying its sketchy taking public transport etc. I told\
  \ her I'm saving up again for a honda, and will get it next month. She just tells\
  \ me to ask my parents for the money or dip into my savings. I told her she has\
  \ no idea how most people live real life so she shouldn't be giving out financial\
  \ advice because her dad funds her whole life. She got very pissed at me and said\
  \ that she's not dumb and so on and basically called me a huge asshole. Her friends\
  \ also contacted me and told me to apologize to her, and oh her friends are the\
  \ exact same way. Spoiled rich white girls who go to Western (my ontario mans will\
  \ get this one). I told them to kick rocks. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAITA?"
