selftext: 'Title kinda sounds fucked up but hear me out lol


  I recently was on an international flight and I always try to snag the window seat
  so I can sleep. A woman was seated next to me and asked if I could give up my seat
  since it turned out that her 6 year old was apparently seated in the row across.
  I tried to be nice about it and said, "Sorry, but I specifically chose this seat
  and I don''t really want to give it up, I''ve been traveling for hours."


  The woman''s response was, "Well so have we! Imagine traveling with an overtired
  kindergartener who now won''t be able to sleep since she can''t sit by her mom!"
  She made me look like an asshole in front of the other people on the flight, and
  I felt bad since it was a little kid. I agree that it probably sucks to be traveling
  with a little kid, but AITA for not giving up my seat?


  EDIT:


  1. I was seated in the window seat, the woman was in the middle seat next to me,
  and another passenger was in the aisle seat next to her. 6 year old kid was across
  in the next row over in the aisle seat. Since the mother and the kid were only one
  seat away from each other, it wasn''t so much an issue of not being seated next
  to each other, but more that the mom wanted her kid to have the window seat so she
  could sleep

  2. This wasn''t an issue of separation and the kid being scared. Her mom was ONE
  seat away. This was an issue of wanting the seat for her kid just so she could sleep

  3. For those asking duration of the flight: 6 hours

  4. For those asking "Why didn''t she ask the other person in the aisle seat?" Because
  she specifically wanted the window seat for her child'
