selftext: "Dad here, old fart, loves his daughter to pieces but I\u2019m struggling\
  \ to see eye to eye with my teenager and wife on this one. \n\nWe\u2019ve always\
  \ been a meat eating family, we live in the rural Midwest and bacon for breakfast\
  \ is pretty much a given. This year my 14 y/o daughter decided to go vegan, and\
  \ I jumped onto her support team with enthusiasm. We learned how to substitute ingredients,\
  \ cook new things, try new things, I adjusted our budget to include more expensive\
  \ vegan substitutes for her, etc. \n\nNone of this has been a problem for me until\
  \ recently. She saw me cook bacon in a pan, and then I rinsed it out to load in\
  \ the dishwasher. She exploded in anger (teen years, I\u2019m not too fussed about\
  \ the anger explosion, I know she doesn\u2019t mean it) and said that that was HER\
  \ pan for vegan food. I was completely floored and said, kiddo this here is a family\
  \ pan, older than you, it\u2019s not YOUR pan. \n\nShe asked me to purchase her\
  \ a pan that she can solely use for vegan food. I didn\u2019t want her to feel weird\
  \ about food, so I said sure, and ordered her a few colored ones that are only for\
  \ her. The reason they\u2019re colored is so it helps me remember that I\u2019m\
  \ not to touch them unless I\u2019m cooking vegan. \n\nThat wasn\u2019t good enough.\
  \ Now apparently the dishwasher is \u2018contaminated\u2019 with animal product,\
  \ and the fridge has \u2018bacon grease fingers\u2019 on it (because I eat bacon\
  \ and then touch the fridge) and she\u2019s asked me and her mom to completely stop\
  \ eating meat at home. I don\u2019t mean I literally touch the fridge with greasy\
  \ bacon hands, because I wash my hands, but it\u2019s clearly enough that it upsets\
  \ my daughter. \n\nfrankly I\u2019m on team hell no, her mom is much more amenable\
  \ and strongly wants me to consider taking our daughter up on the request. My wife\u2019\
  s reasoning is that both our parents live close so we can eat meat products there,\
  \ and that she doesn\u2019t want our daughter to feel uncomfortable in the kitchen.\
  \ My daughter says she is fine with cheese and butter in the fridge, but it\u2019\
  s specifically meat products that make her feel sick. Now I\u2019m sorry for her,\
  \ but I feel like she just needs to adapt and live side by side, because I\u2019\
  m not going to stop eating bacon in my own house."
