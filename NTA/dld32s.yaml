selftext: "This is a throwaway account.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor background, I (22F) am\
  \ very petite, fit, and just by looking at me one would not guess I have a physical\
  \ disability. 2 weeks ago, I had surgery with incisions on my spine and one butt\
  \ cheek making walking more difficult temporarily. Though, I have a handicap placard\
  \ not just because I had surgery, but for the overall problem that me to be unable\
  \ to walk long distances.\n\nI\u2019m not asking AITA for refusing to give up my\
  \ spot, but because of what I said. My brother thinks I went too far, but I think\
  \ I afforded the woman the same amount of respect she gave me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI\
  \ was going out to dinner with my brother (passenger seat.) I pulled into one of\
  \ 4 handicap spots in front of a restaurant and the woman (late 60s) in the car\
  \ to my right immediately opened her door to block my brother from getting out.\
  \ We waited a few seconds, and it became clear this was intentional. I got out of\
  \ the car and asked her if she would close her door.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe woman immediately\
  \ started berating me, saying I had no right to use the handicap spot as other people\
  \ \u201Cthat actually need it\u201D would be unable to park. Apparently, I am young\
  \ and skinny enough to suck it up (though she doesn\u2019t know what my disability\
  \ is) and deal with parking far away. She called me an entitled brat and accused\
  \ me of \u201Cscamming the government to support \\[my\\] lazy ass,\u201D among\
  \ other things. I told her a doctor saw fit I get a handicap placard, and when she\
  \ said I look \u201Cfine\u201D I told her that my medical history is none of her\
  \ business. She continued to insult me, even calling me a lazy bitch at one point,\
  \ and refused to close her door.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI eventually had enough and let\
  \ her have it. I told her something along the lines of, maybe if you didn\u2019\
  t eat yourself into debilitating obesity others \u2018that actually need it\u2019\
  \ would be able to use your spot. She tried to respond by saying her weight was\
  \ due to medical issues, to which I cut her off to say if she\u2019s going to make\
  \ assumptions about me I will do the same. I called her a miserable old bitter bitch\
  \ and told her at her big old age she should have learned to mind her business.\
  \ She threatened to call the police on me for reasons she was unable to verbalize\
  \ and I told her to go ahead and pointed to the restaurant we were going to and\
  \ told her to send them in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen my brother heard this he finally\
  \ crawled out of the driver's side. He said something like calm down and let's go\
  \ inside, and I said that sounds like a great idea if the nosy bitch will leave\
  \ us alone, but she seems too fat to follow up with the police and bring them inside.\
  \ Then we walked away with her still yelling things at me with her door open. She\
  \ either didn\u2019t call the police or they refused to come.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know\
  \ what I said was harsh but I\u2019m pretty tired of people making assumptions about\
  \ my pain and telling me about my pain. Maybe I should regret it, but I don\u2019\
  t have an ounce of remorse for what I said. AITA?"
