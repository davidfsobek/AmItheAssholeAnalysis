selftext: "Yesterday we had a baby shower. Long story short, one of our family friends\
  \ thought it would be funny to get some baby onesies with offensive things written\
  \ on them. For example: \n\n* \"All daddy wanted was a blow job\" \n* \"I'm with\
  \ the milf\" \n* \"To-do list: Eat, poop, suck some titties\" \n\nThere were like\
  \ 2 more but I don't remember what they said. When I opened the gift I was humiliated,\
  \ I thought it was really inappropriate. Before people on here give me shit about\
  \ not being able to take a joke, I just didn't really think this was the funniest\
  \ \"joke.\" I was mad about the gift because as I was opening and before I could\
  \ read what they said, I unfolded the onesie and showed the rest of the party. Some\
  \ people gave let out a small chuckle, some people looked around at each other kinda\
  \ surprised. Anyhow, at the end of the party, I asked the person who gave it to\
  \ me if I could have the gift receipt to return them. I said I definitely wouldn't\
  \ put my baby in those clothes. The person basically called me oversensitive and\
  \ said I needed to take a joke. I handed the gift bag back to them and said \"Alright,\
  \ well then you can keep these.\" They were super offended by that and thought it\
  \ was an ungrateful gesture. AITA?"
