selftext: "EDIT: Thanks y'all! I'm not going to talk to any higher-ups unless something\
  \ like this happens again. I've read many helpful comments and many ridiculous ones,\
  \ the only thing I feel I need to clarify is that I keep my joking about religious\
  \ iconography confined to ranty posts on the internet. In fact I just avoid talking\
  \ about religion in general unless it's with my husband, since most of my nearest\
  \ and dearest are Christians as well. Some of you also got the reference, so thanks\
  \ for not immediately accusing me of being one of \"those atheists\"! \n\nSo last\
  \ night at work, it was pretty clear that my manager was stressed out/in a bad mood.\
  \ During our startup meeting, she was discussing how much work we had to do, improvements\
  \ we needed to make, and the fact that no one was meeting production goals. Next\
  \ week is the beginning of peak season, so essentially she was telling us to get\
  \ our shit together. After her speech, an older lady who was working overtime and\
  \ from another shift, said, \"After all that we need some good news! I've got some\
  \ good news for y'all!\" \n\nWhen my manager asked her what the good news was, she\
  \ said, \"Jesus is coming back!\" Now, I found this pretty annoying, but it has\
  \ less to do with the fact that I'm an atheist and more to do with us being at *work*.\
  \ I'm used to people inappropriately inserting jesus into random conversations or\
  \ assuming everyone around them is a Christian (born and raised in Georgia), so\
  \ I rolled my eyes but knew there was no point in voicing my opinion. Plus, my manager\
  \ responded with, \"Amen,\" along with one of my coworkers. Safe to say there were\
  \ more people on the older lady's side than mine. \n\nThis is where it gets worse\
  \ and where I actually got offended, or rather uncomfortable. After the meeting,\
  \ when we were all getting our equipment out and getting to our various stations,\
  \ the older lady came up to me. Only me, from what I saw. She stuck out her hand\
  \ to give me some Jesus propaganda, and when I tried to refuse (nicely, all I said\
  \ was no thank you in a pleasant tone), she insisted and said that I needed it.\
  \ I'm assuming she saw me roll my eyes at her comment during startup. \n\nI really\
  \ did not appreciate this at all, and her singling me out like that changed my mind\
  \ on the whole \"no point in voicing my opinion\" thing. My husband, who works at\
  \ the same place in another department, was also pretty pissed about it. \n\nI don't\
  \ think there's much point in asking my manager to talk to this lady, because she\
  \ is very much a Christian judging by her southern curly-scripted bible verse T\
  \ shirts and her lowercase T necklace. My husband says I should bring this up to\
  \ HR so that someone can tell this lady how not okay it is to confront someone with\
  \ religion in the workplace. \n\nSo, WIBTA if I do? There's a big chance that HR\
  \ and everyone I work with will think I'm an asshole."
