selftext: 'So recently I got my license and my dad thought it would be a good idea
  for me to drive my little sister home. She would normally walk speaking she falls
  right under the 1.5 mile rule our school system implemented. The first few days
  went fine but then she unplugged my phone from the aux cord and started blasting
  her music. I took notice by not moving and giving her a funny look. She replied
  with a snarky what and I asked her why she unplugged my phone. She responds with
  "I got tired of listening to your music". I told her that if she wants a ride home
  she''ll have to listen to my music. I then unplugged her phone and started driving.
  Then she gets bold and while I''m driving unplugs my phone and starts playing her
  music again. So I pullover and tell her to get out. She kinda sat there and looked
  confused but after repeating myself a few times she hopped out. I wasn''t expecting
  the backlash from my stepmom when I got home. She was pissed and "threatened" me
  with calling my dad and telling him about my reckless behavior. She went on to call
  me an ego maniac and other names. When my dad got home it started a argument between
  them because he thinks I was justified. From my POV she''s a 7th grader that should
  understand that her actions have consequences. I understand it is a little thing
  but I gave her a warning and she didn''t respect it.

  EDIT: It is my vehicle I pay gas and Insurance. I didn''t feel like this was relevant
  but I digress. EDIT 2: I drive a coupe so I don''t have backseats.'
