selftext: "Hi\n\nI'll keep this simple, and avoid going over the top.\n\nIn a nutshell\
  \ my GF (33) and her little girl (7) moved into my (35/M) house last year.  The\
  \ house is owned and I bought it because I have two children (8 YO twins - M and\
  \ F) from a previous relationship.\n\nWhen she moved her and her girl in I made\
  \ it clear she was welcome to stay as long as she treated my house as she would\
  \ her own.\n\nYet when she moved in her amd her daughter did the following over\
  \ the last year or so.\n\n- Left mountains of food everywhere.  - Left pans of food\
  \ on the kitchen counter until it went green with mold.\n- Got muck/handprints everywhere\n\
  - Broke and refused to replace things in my house\n- Would leave the radiators,\
  \ lights, gas on all day\n- Refused to tidy up saying she was tired\n- Left mountains\
  \ of clothes everywhere\n- Used the floor as a rubbish bin (ended up with mice)\n\
  - Constant drama, shouting, arguing - Witnessed by neighbours\n- Literally drained\
  \ me emotionally and financially\n- Both of them gave me attitude non-stop, for\
  \ no particular reason other than to stave the boredom.\n- Put holes for shelves\
  \ etc in all my walls\n- Would spend money on fun things for her and her daughter,\
  \ yet left me to pay the grown up things like bills, debt etc\n- Kept leaving the\
  \ toilet a mess\n- Treat my own 2 children like dirt when they came over, ie shouting,\
  \ drama, constantly blaming them for everything etc\n\nWhen I questioned her on\
  \ any of these matters she would say I was being controlling.\n\nAbout a month ago,\
  \ a serious argument erupted and I told her it's best she leave.  I said 'if you\
  \ want to live like that, then go and get your own place'.  It was a shame for me\
  \ to see my hard earned investment become ruined by someone with no respect for\
  \ it.\n\nWe are still seeing each other, but now she has gotten her own place I\
  \ feel terrible.  She's having to walk everywhere as she dosent drive, and her working\
  \ hours have altered as previously I was taking her little girl to school to make\
  \ life easier for her.  Also, she was only paying me \xA3165 per month for everything,\
  \ but now her bills will be in excess of \xA3600 per month for her rent alone.\n\
  \nI feel dreadful for this, I feel like maybe I should have had more patience towards\
  \ them or been a better guy when they were here.\n\nAITA?  Or would anyone else\
  \ have reacted in the same way?\n\n\nEdit: Just to follow up - She doesn't drive\
  \ and I also feel bad that now she has to walk/get the bis everywhere as before\
  \ I was acting like her own private taxi service.  Ie, taking her shopping, giving\
  \ her daughter lifts to school and to dance classes etc.\n\nUPDATE:  Wow, didn't\
  \ expect such a response from this!\n\nAfter getting many responses, roughly 90%\
  \ of which say I'm NTA and the rest saying I am for staying with her I've decided\
  \ to break this off.\nLike some of you've mentioned, I owe this to my children and\
  \ myself to give them what they need.  A good, solid, strong dad who is happy and\
  \ secure.  As of this point, she is no longer in my life.\n\nA while ago I asked\
  \ my 8yo daughter if she thinks about me when she's not at my house, her answer\
  \ was:\n\n \"Yes I think of you getting shouted at by XXXX\"\n\nSome of you have\
  \ said I'm a shit dad for staying with her after all of this.  I would argue against\
  \ this, but if I stay with her I would have to agree with you all.\n\nUPDATE:  I\
  \ wasnt going to post this, but as many of you are asking about it as you consider\
  \ it a factor, I'll respond.\n\nA)  No the sex was mediocre at best, once a week\
  \ if I was lucky.\n\nB)  She never gave BJs\n\nC)  She INSISTED on me giving her\
  \ oral sex before we slept together.  Every time.  She told me \"Go down on me,\
  \ or there is no sex\"\n\nD)  Never did anything else.  Vanilla sex was as far as\
  \ we ever went"
