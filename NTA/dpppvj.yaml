selftext: "Using a throwaway. Some context; I live in CA, and my wife\u2019s niece\
  \ wanted to come visit us for a few weeks. She\u2019s 22, I\u2019ve known her since\
  \ she was 4. Her dad walked out on her family when she was 8. She\u2019s very sheltered\
  \ by her mother. Anyway, I told my wife it was fine with me if she visits. She\u2019\
  s a good kid, and our 5 year old son loves his cousin and really wanted to see her.\n\
  \nBut then my wife goes, \u201CAnd she (the niece) wants to bring her bf.....he\u2019\
  s 47.\u201D\n\nI\u2019m 41, my wife is 42. I was like \u201CYou\u2019re kidding,\
  \ right?\u201D\n\nShe wasn\u2019t kidding. At first, I was like \u201CHell no.\u201D\
  \ But after about a week of talking, I gave in....with one caveat. I told my wife\
  \ that if this dude is staying in our house, I\u2019m going to ask some questions\
  \ he might not like. She wanted to know what kind of questions, and I gave her some.\n\
  \n1. How did you guys meet and who made the first move? (If the dude made the first\
  \ move, it\u2019s weird).\n\n2. Has the dude been married, does he have kids?\n\n\
  3. Why are you (the dude) dating such a young woman?\n\n4. Are you (the dude) aware\
  \ of the young woman\u2019s history with her father? \n\n5. What\u2019s the end\
  \ game here? A serious relationship, marriage? Have you (the dude) discussed what\
  \ will happen if the young woman gets pregnant?\n\nI know, I\u2019m not the girl\u2019\
  s father, but no one else in her family is asking these questions. Her mother is\
  \ fine with the relationship (which boggles my mind). \n\nSo, fast forward to the\
  \ visit. Niece and old dude show up. I\u2019m cordial. I wait till evening, after\
  \ everything is settled and dinner is over, and I invite the dude to join me on\
  \ the porch for a beer. Just me and him. Then I start asking my questions. \n\n\
  After only my second question, the guy starts getting defensive. He told me this\
  \ is \u201CNone of my business.\u201D I got a little pissed at that. \n\nI told\
  \ him he\u2019s staying in my home for a week, I can ask him a few questions. And\
  \ the girl is my niece, I\u2019m not out of bounds here. He told me I was making\
  \ him \u201Cuncomfortable\u201D. I replied that I\u2019m uncomfortable having a\
  \ dude who\u2019s clearly taking advantage of a young girl stay in my home. I said\
  \ You can answer my questions and act like you\u2019re a stand-up guy, or feel free\
  \ to hit the fucking road.\n\nWell, he left. My wife and niece were upset with me.\
  \ They said I acted like a jerk and that if my niece is happy, to let it go. Again,\
  \ I was told it\u2019s none of my business. They have since broken up, which I am\
  \ glad about. Not sure if my actions were the cause.\n\nSo Am I an asshole for questioning\
  \ this guy?\n\nEDIT: some info:\n\nI asked my questions in the order written, and\
  \ only asked him the first two before he got \u201Cuncomfortable\u201D.\n\nI would\
  \ certainly do the same thing with any older woman my son brought home. \n\nWhen\
  \ I took the old dude outside for a beer, I neglected to mention we had 5-10 mins\
  \ of talk. We discussed the new Star Wars movies of all things.\n\nI would love\
  \ to discuss more with some of you, but I was a bit hot-headed and appropriately\
  \ banned for 5 days. So it goes.\n\nEdit 2: Some of you here asked what\u2019s up\
  \ with my wife and her sister. Her side of the family suffer from innocent naivety\
  \ and just assuming everyone they meet is a good person. They\u2019re wonderful\
  \ people who need an asshole like me to keep them centered.\n\nFINAL EDIT: Some\
  \ of you wondered if I would accept any of the dudes answers to my questions. Of\
  \ course, all he had to be was respectful and honest in answering and I wouldn\u2019\
  t have a problem. \n\nTalked to my niece this morning. She and I are totally fine.\
  \ Knew my actions came from wanting to keep her safe. I apologized for my actions\
  \ regardless. \n\nAsked why they broke up.\n\nThe guy was cheating on his wife.\
  \ He confessed it to her and said he would get a divorce for her. Has three kids.\
  \ All her age or older. She dumped him."
