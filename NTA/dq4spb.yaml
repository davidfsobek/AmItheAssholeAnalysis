selftext: "I\u2019ll start by saying we\u2019ve been together for 3 years. We have\
  \ a great relationship and he\u2019s a wonderful father to our child. The proposal\
  \ really came out of nowhere. I was in the bathroom getting ready to take our little\
  \ one to daycare, which we were already running late for. My boyfriend walked in\
  \ behind me and held a ring up in his hand and just said \u2018Will you marry me?\u2019\
  \ I honestly thought it was a joke and the ring was simply a gift. I laughed, said\
  \ yes, put the ring on and left.\n\nWhen I got home and spoke to my boyfriend, I\
  \ realized he actually *did* ask me to marry him. I would\u2019ve said yes either\
  \ way (if it was a joke or not) but I was just left feeling a bit.. disappointed\
  \ and empty, I guess. I\u2019m not the biggest fan of the ring either. It\u2019\
  s big and chunky and uncomfortable to wear. It was meant to be sapphire to match\
  \ my birthstone he said, but he \u2018accidentally\u2019 got the wrong colour. It\u2019\
  s not my style and it doesn\u2019t suit me whatsoever. We\u2019ve never looked at\
  \ engagement rings together so he wouldn\u2019t know what I like. I mentioned this\
  \ to him and asked if he would mind if I bought a smaller ring (with my own money)\
  \ to wear instead but he got quite offended by that and called me ungrateful. He\u2019\
  s been moody ever since. May I add that the ring he bought wasn\u2019t expensive,\
  \ so it\u2019s not like he\u2019d be wasting lots of money if I didn\u2019t wear\
  \ it. (Price doesn\u2019t matter to me.)\n\nI wasn\u2019t expecting a grand gesture\
  \ or huge proposal.. but a little effort would\u2019ve been nice, not just asking\
  \ me in the damn bathroom. It\u2019s meant to be a special moment and memory and\
  \ it\u2019s just.. not. AITA for being upset over this?"
