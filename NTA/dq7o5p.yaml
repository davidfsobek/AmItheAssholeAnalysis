selftext: "I own a liquor store in the suburbs. Overall the area is decently safe,\
  \ especially compared to the city.\n\nTwo weeks ago, a young man and one of his\
  \ friends came into the store and ran off with bottles of liquor. We reported them\
  \ to law enforcement with the license plates. Officers tracked them and asked if\
  \ we want to pursue charges. \n\nTwo days later one of the kids mothers comes by\
  \ and begs me to drop the charges. She says her son is the first one in the family\
  \ to go to college and that he has a scholarship and that if the university finds\
  \ out they will rescind their offer, and the scholarship.\n\nI told her I am sorry\
  \ but I already have made up my mind. Since then people in the community have treated\
  \ me much worse I believe she probably told a lot of people I don\u2019t know her\
  \ version of events. \n\nBut now I am a being seen as a horrible person. And that\
  \ I am directly responsible for what the university chooses to do. And people are\
  \ saying that if a white kid robbed me that I wouldn\u2019t have went to the police.\
  \ And this is not true, I am an equal opportunity reporter\n\nI don\u2019t know\
  \ what\u2019s going on to be honest, it also appears that he had a previous criminal\
  \ record as well.\n\nI don\u2019t think I did anything wrong here. If you get caught\
  \ stealing you should have to deal with the consequences. But apparently that makes\
  \ me the devil"
