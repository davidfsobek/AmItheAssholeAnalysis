selftext: "My gym has multiple squat racks facing mirrors opposite each other. This\
  \ means that while your in the rack looking in the mirror, over your shoulder on\
  \ either side is other people facing away from you in their own rack.  Because it\
  \ might help with context I\u2019m 6\u2019, 170lbs (so not some giant bodybuilder)\
  \ and the girl in this story is average height and weight as well (not some fitness\
  \ model but not substantially overweight either).  \n\nWhile in between sets, I\u2019\
  m standing with my arms on the bar and generally feeling like shit after my first\
  \ few heavy sets when I see a girl behind me in the mirror at the bottom of her\
  \ squat and immediately notice that I can clearly see her ass through her pants.\
  \ \n\nLike 90% of people in the gym I just want to be left alone, ignore everyone,\
  \ and pretend the world doesn\u2019t exist.  So I move on with life and do another\
  \ set, but then she does her set and sure enough when she is at the bottom of her\
  \ squat her yoga pants are stretched on her ass they go completely see through and\
  \ I can pretty much see her butthole.  I don\u2019t mean if I squint and stare,\
  \ I mean plain as day, anyone on my side of the racks can see through her pants.\
  \ \n\nNo idea why I cared (am married and completely uninterested) but I go into\
  \ helpful mode and pull my headphones out and turn around quietly enough that only\
  \ the two of us can hear say this:\n\n\u201CHey this is super creepy, but I\u2019\
  d feel creepier if I didn\u2019t say something.  When you squat, your pants stretch\
  \ and go completely see through on your ass.\u201D\n\nAgain I thought I was being\
  \ helpful and that she\u2019d want to know, but wholly shit did she not see it that\
  \ way. This girl practically screams \u201CYou fucking pervert! Stop staring at\
  \ my ass!\u201D \n\nNot needing to be told twice now that half the gym is staring\
  \ at me, I go back to my workout and suffer the angry looks for another 20min and\
  \ go home.  \n\nI tell my wife about it who laughs and says I was totally an asshole\
  \ for saying that and she\u2019d be pissed and super embarrassed if someone did\
  \ that to her. So reddit, settle this, AITA?"
