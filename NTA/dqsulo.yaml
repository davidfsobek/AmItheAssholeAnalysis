selftext: "My ex and I have two boys (7 and 11) and we have 50-50 custody. Every Thursday\
  \ she comes to my house to pick them up for her time. I noticed more and more food\
  \ was gone, but not for sure. I was able to confirm that food was going missing\
  \ because someone drank my last can of Ginger Ale. I asked my sons' sitter if he\
  \ knew anything about it and he said my ex drank it. I was confused. Apparently,\
  \ when my ex comes to pick up them up, she'll start making a snack for herself like\
  \ she lives there. I thought about it and want it to stop.\n\nThe issue is that\
  \ she is unemployed and has no money. I believe she is hungry. It's not about the\
  \ money or cleaning up after yourself - it's about boundaries.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT\
  \ - I do pay her child support, $300 a month. I make 90K a year and she makes 45K\
  \ a year. However, I pay for the kids' tuition and cover their insurance. I believe\
  \ that my ex is barely breaking even at the end of each month and lives paycheck-to-paycheck.\
  \ She lost her job back in August and just found something in October so that fucked\
  \ her finances up. \n\nThat's not my problem though.  \n\nMy problem is that she\
  \ just welcomes herself to my food. Literally, the stuff she eats is the food that\
  \ I buy for myself. For example, my diet ginger ale. It pisses me off that I come\
  \ home and want to have a nice cold ginger ale with my dinner only to find that\
  \ the last few were drank. And when she uses a plate, she'll rinse it off but doesn't\
  \ dry it or even put it in the fucking dish washer."
