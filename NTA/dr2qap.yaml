selftext: 'For the sake of convenience, I''ll call homophobe ''J''.


  J and I used to be friends in school, until I came out as gay and he began to distance
  himself from me and spread rumors. He then started saying it was gross/wrong etc.


  Years pass, and I''m scrolling through Grindr when I spot a faceless torso picture,
  unmistakably his due to a set of freckles on his chest, the username being his first
  initial, and the distance from me matching where he lives. His profile states that
  is hookup only, with no face pictures given.


  I think to myself "Oh, he came out, good for him." Then I look at his FaceBook.
  He''s still spouting homophobia, sharing LGBT stories with his own opinions etc,
  and harrassing LGBT people that he comes across online.


  So, WIBTA to tell him if I found his profile and recognized him, many of the people
  he''s insulted could easily find him as well?


  Edit: If I do tell him I''ve seen the account, it will be private through Facebook
  or Grindr. It isn''t anybodies'' place to publically out somebody that doesn''t
  want to be out.'
