selftext: "Throwaway account sorry!\n\nBasically my husband and I have been married\
  \ about six years, and have a 3 year old daughter, Elle. \n\nPrior to getting married\
  \ and having Elle, we were both very independent people. This hasn\u2019t changed\
  \ - as much as we value our couple/family time, we also both cherish time to ourselves\
  \ and with our own friends.\n\nWe came up with an agreement that we each get ONE\
  \ weekend a year to do whatever we like - go away, stay in a hotel, go out with\
  \ friends - while the other stays home looking after Elle. It\u2019s been working\
  \ really well so far.\n\nWell this past weekend was my husbands time and he chose\
  \ a fishing trip with his pals, staying in a cabin roughly 30 mins away. No problems.\n\
  \nSaturday morning, the worst happened - my sister was involved in a serious car\
  \ wreck. She\u2019s on life support, it\u2019s touch and go and I\u2019m devastated.\
  \ I can\u2019t say much more.\n\nI called my husband to tell him and ask he come\
  \ home ASAP - and he refused. He said it\u2019s his weekend, and he\u2019ll come\
  \ by the hospital Monday. He wasn\u2019t totally heartless, he listened to me cry\
  \ and scream and reassured me she\u2019d be ok (how do we know that?) but he was\
  \ adamant that he\u2019s enjoying the remainder of his weekend and will join me\
  \ today. \n\nMy family are obviously noticing his absence and I\u2019m too embarrassed\
  \ to tell them. I understand this is interfering with his weekend but this is my\
  \ SISTER and she\u2019s in critical condition. I\u2019m stunned, he\u2019s never\
  \ been this selfish before. I\u2019m angry, upset, confused and I just don\u2019\
  t know what to do.\n\nI told him if he didn\u2019t come home now, don\u2019t bother\
  \ coming home at all - now I\u2019m wondering if I was too harsh because I haven\u2019\
  t slept in two days and I\u2019m a wreck.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: wow I didn\u2019t think\
  \ this would attract any attention, especially this early. Thank you all for the\
  \ healing thoughts and well wishes!\n\nI just want to clarify re: this weekend arrangement\
  \ - my husband and I regularly have date nights and nights out with friends throughout\
  \ the year. This \u201Ctotally alone do what you like YOLO weekend\u201D is the\
  \ thing that happens once per year. He sees his friends on a weekly basis, as do\
  \ I.\n\nUpdate 2: Seriously never expected this many replies, I\u2019m so touched\
  \ by your kind words. Thank you, so much. It\u2019s horrifying to me that strangers\
  \ on the internet offered me more support than my husband.\n\nApologies for not\
  \ updating sooner, been at the hospital all day and not checking my phone. Mostly\
  \ because I don\u2019t want to speak to him.\n\nMy sisters still in the same condition,\
  \ not breathing on her own yet. Waiting for some test results.\n\nTo answer some\
  \ questions: thankfully Elle is with my best friend. I didn\u2019t want her exposed\
  \ to a hospital ICU and around panicked/highly emotional family, so she\u2019s happily\
  \ having a sleepover with her \u201Cother auntie.\u201D \n\nI realized I made it\
  \ sound like my husband and I ONLY get one weekend per year which is my fault. This\
  \ one weekend (we call YOLO weekend) is on top of weekly nights out, time with friends,\
  \ time alone etc. it\u2019s more of like a chance for us to do things further afield\
  \ or go nuts without having to worry about waking up early with Elle. Trust me,\
  \ he sees his friends all the time. That\u2019s what hurts the most.\n\nI\u2019\
  ve read your comments about an affair and I don\u2019t know, it doesn\u2019t seem\
  \ likely but who the fuck knows at this point. He\u2019s not the person I thought\
  \ he was.\n\nHe did show up this afternoon. I met him in the lobby, told him to\
  \ go fuck himself, and went back up to the ICU. I don\u2019t want him here. I\u2019\
  m still running on no sleep so I\u2019m probably being an asshole now, but I hate\
  \ his guts at the moment.\n\nThat\u2019s all for now, thank you all so much again\
  \ <3\n\nUpdate 3: Thanks u/R3DV1K1NG for your sweet message. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/6hvMsSF"
