selftext: 'I bought some land including a house on a corner lot across from a school.
  There''s a "public" park on the property which I also inherited. As far as I''m
  aware, this park has been open to the public for a couple of decades. I''m not super
  familiar as I''m relatively new to this town. It''s one of three parks and obviously
  it''s heavily used due to the closeness of an elementary school.


  My lawyer says it''s an "easement" meaning the public is free to use it out of habit/tradition
  yet it remains my responsibility. I guess the prior owner maintained it with some
  help from the town through the mayor''s office and volunteers. The prior owner was
  a developer/philanthropist who did a lot of the small town.


  I don''t like this because it opens me up to liability. I''ve asked the mayor''s
  office if they''d like to hire surveyors to redraw property lines and consider it
  public property rather than my property, for free no less, and they''ve refused.
  They don''t want the liability or the cost of hiring workers and lawyers to make
  it happen.


  Putting up signage or fences haven''t really worked so I want to uproot it all and
  just make it lawn. Before this, when I had signage up, some of the parents of students
  at the school started a petition to "save their park", not knowing it''s privately
  owned and not part of the town''s public spaces. Trying to reason with some of them
  fell on deaf ears.


  Would I be the asshole? Still working it out legally with my lawyer else I''d have
  posted this on /r/legaladvice. I''m looking for moral/ethical opinions on whether
  I should or not. I just don''t want a kid to get hurt, parents go to the mayor,
  mayor sends them to me.'
