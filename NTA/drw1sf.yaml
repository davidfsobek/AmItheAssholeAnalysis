selftext: "A regular offered me $100 to take a shot with him, he has been drinking\
  \ at the bar I worked at for over 10 years, I worked there for 4 years. I made a\
  \ shot with sour mix and cranberry to match the color of his so he thought I was\
  \ taking one. I just want to make extra money.\n\nMy manager happened to see this\
  \ on the cameras. There is a strict no drinking policy at this bar for bartenders\
  \ on the clock, and it\u2019s a new manager who is trying to show her authority\
  \ so she made an example of me and fired me.\n\nThere is no way to prove there wasn\u2019\
  t booze in my shot, I saw the footage and with the liquor gun we have right next\
  \ to the pop gun there is no way to prove I didn\u2019t put liquor in that shot.\n\
  \nI honestly don\u2019t and didn\u2019t care enough to argue with her about it.\
  \ I\u2019m about to start a new job since I graduate from school after this semester\
  \ and am not to concerned about my future in bartending.\n\nI trained basically\
  \ every new person at this bar, and I was honest with them that I was fired in our\
  \ work group chat. They all started saying if you got fired for that we don\u2019\
  t want to work here either. They were all saying bad things about the manager and\
  \ how they want to screw the whole bar over by all quitting at the same time.\n\n\
  I told them that our new manager is balls to the walls. I said I\u2019m going to\
  \ be just fine, but not to make my same mistake and drink ANYTHING out of a shot\
  \ glass because she is that concerned about it. I also told them to think for themselves\
  \ and do whatever they need to when it comes to their jobs.\n\nI then let my anger\
  \ overtake me and I said \u201Cif you want to find a job where you don\u2019t have\
  \ to be constantly looking over your back and have to be worried about an insane\
  \ manager find different bartending and serving jobs. You\u2019re all capable people\
  \ that don\u2019t deserve a psycho watching over you when you\u2019ve put good time\
  \ into a work place.\u201D I basically contradicted myself. \n\nI feel like I went\
  \ over the top, my sister said I should\u2019ve kept my mouth shut. But I explained\
  \ the whole situation to the old manager, who taught me the \u201Cmix things together\
  \ to look like booze so people don\u2019t feel rejected when they buy you shots\
  \ trick\u201D. She thinks it\u2019s crazy the new manager won\u2019t trust me after\
  \ training so many people in and my old manager loves me.\n\nMy old manager quit\
  \ because she was moving away with her fianc\xE9, but she told the new manager that\
  \ I was trustworthy and I thought the new manager would have some trust considering\
  \ I was basically running the bar when she came in. \n\nWhatever the case, AITAH\
  \ for letting a lot of employees quit on my behalf? Because as of now 7/10 bartenders\
  \ where I was fired from are planning a group quit. I don\u2019t want the bar to\
  \ close, but I want my manager to realize that she messed up..."
