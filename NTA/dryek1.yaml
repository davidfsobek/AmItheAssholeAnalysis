selftext: "My (25M) girlfriend (23F) has always talked about how it\u2019s her dream\
  \ to move to X country. She brought it up on our first date (we\u2019ve been together\
  \ for a year and some change) and has mentioned it practically every other day since.\
  \ \n\nAt the beginning, I went along with it, told her how cool it would be, we\
  \ talked about if I would go with her, how crappy our current country is (I\u2019\
  m an expat and she\u2019s a local), etc etc \n\nRecently, however, every few times\
  \ she mentions it, I\u2019ll bring up her spending habits. In the time we\u2019\
  ve been together, she\u2019s spent around 8,000USD+ of her own money (plus her credit\
  \ cards) on a few high ticket items. \n\nThe last time she brought it up we sat\
  \ down and calculated how much money she\u2019d need to save to get started. \n\n\
  After we had the number, I started calculating something else. Balenciaga shoes\
  \ + LV bag + Gucci sunglasses etc etc until we came up with the number she needed\
  \ to move and told her it\u2019s never going to happen if she keep buying expensive\
  \ things \n\nShe\u2019s called me TA, that I\u2019m trying to control her money,\
  \ I\u2019m trying to humiliate her, make her feel \u201Csmall\u201D and it\u2019\
  s none of my business what she buys, and of course all of her friends are saying\
  \ the same thing \n\nIMO she could have made her dream come true long ago, and I\
  \ was only trying to lay it out for her\n\nAITA?"
