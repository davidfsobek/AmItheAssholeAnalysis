selftext: "Hello redditors\n\nMe and my wife are both in our 40s and we've been married\
  \ for about 15 years. I'm very passionated about sports cars and I own for the time\
  \ being only a sports car. This led my wife to borrowing this car for the last 6\
  \ months whenever she needed to get somewhere. I care for the car a lot as it was\
  \ both expensive and was bought as a \"milestone\" in life that I've worked very\
  \ hard for. Well, here is the problem she damaged it about 2 months ago (minor dent)\
  \ that I was able to fix for not too much money at a local shop. Now, one week ago\
  \ she managed to damage it again and this time we're going to have to order this\
  \ part which comes out to about 2-3k.\n\nSo I told her that she will no be allowed\
  \ to drive it anymore as I neither want to pay for the repairs or want to repair\
  \ the car as it will affect the value when I sell it if it has been repaired a lot\
  \ etc.\n\nSo she got really upset about this and I told her that she should get\
  \ her own car when she wants to go to the city to do shopping. This blew into a\
  \ pretty big fight and even though I didn't budge and we kinda sorted it out I still\
  \ feel like she is pissed at me. So..\n\nEdit: To clarify: the sports car is the\
  \ only car that I currently own, I used to have another car but I sold it. I've\
  \ planned on getting another car for her to use as we had before in the future.\n\
  \nContext update:  It's not like we barely have any money to spare. She makes over\
  \ $100k a year (she makes a bit more than I do). And could go and buy a car today\
  \ if she wanted to. The problem is just the fact that I don't let her drive MY car\
  \ which is pissing her off.\n\nEdit 2: Saw this post blow up and thanks for all\
  \ the replies. Some made me think again on how this played out and I just wanted\
  \ to answer a few questions here instead of replying to every single comment on\
  \ the post.\n\n1. My wife do not use the car to get to work, she gets picked up\
  \ by her driver. Yes driver. lol. (Provided by her work).\n2. She only uses the\
  \ car when she wants to go shopping, we live in the city so it is only used when\
  \ she is shopping \"heavy things\".\n3. We've talked several times about her getting\
  \ a car which she always postpones for some reason.\n4. Yes, I did \"warn\" her\
  \ that I would not want her to be driving the car the first time she dented it.\n\
  5. I do no treat my wife as a child.\n6. We have our own personal things that we\
  \ own, she has a horse. The horse is HERS not mine. The car is MINE not hers. I'm\
  \ not sure where all of you are from where everything in a marriage is splitted\
  \ 50/50. We also own things together of course.\n7. The reason I sold my \"other\"\
  \ car is that I felt I already spent so much on this new car and I didn't want to\
  \ have two cars when we do not use them for anything else but me hobby driving and\
  \ her occasional shopping and some other minor things.\n8. A lot of people wanna\
  \ know, the car is a 2017 911 991 Turbo\n9. I'm not a multimillionaire and neither\
  \ is she. That is the reason for why I'm not (as some people suggests) \"go out\
  \ and buy her a car and get over with it\". I saved up for many many years for the\
  \ car. I don't have money to buy another decent car for her to use without stretching\
  \ my budget very very far.\n10. A lot of people asking regarding the \"driver who\
  \ picks her up\" and it not making sense earning 100k. I'm not sure it is normal\
  \ at other companies but at hers they offer this service. My wife makes well over\
  \ 100k, the reason I said 100k is because it thought it would be enough to prove\
  \ my point that she can afford a car. She makes somewhere around 250. I make around\
  \ 175. We have a lot of expenses, 5 kids all going to go to uni at some point so\
  \ we're also saving for these types of things and therefore a lot of the money we\
  \ make is automatically put into these funds and only a small portion goes into\
  \ \"our own\" saving accounts. This is where I during the course of many many years\
  \ saved up for my car, also we did not earn this much our entire lives. \n11. Both\
  \ the times she damaged the car it was in our parking garage, her fault. Nobody\
  \ else but her and the concrete pillars involved. \n\nAITA for this?"
