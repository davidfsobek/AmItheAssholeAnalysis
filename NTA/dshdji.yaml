selftext: "I (23F) am the oldest of 4 siblings. My dad passed away when I was 14,\
  \ leaving us and my mom. \n\nThere's a bit of an age gap between me and my siblings.\
  \ So when my dad passed my mom looked at me for babysitting duties. Walking them\
  \ to school, getting them ready in the morning, cooking for them, helping them with\
  \ homework, getting them in bed at the right time, all that. If I had to guess I'd\
  \ say I spend 4 hours a day minimum taking care of them, most days more. Plus an\
  \ hour or so on chores. \n\nNow I love my siblings, and I love my mom. But from\
  \ when I was 14 till I moved out at 19 I had no social life, no hobbies, barely\
  \ any friends. All there was was taking care of them, chores, school, and from 16\
  \ to later work too. \n\nI'm on good terms with my mom, we meet for coffee about\
  \ twice a month to catch up. I've been in a steady relationship for over 2.5 years,\
  \ so whenever we meet my mom brings up marriage and kids. I've politely told her\
  \ I don't want any of that yet, possibly ever, so she can stop asking. \n\nWhen\
  \ she kept pushing (spread out over several visits after I told her to stop asking)\
  \ i told her \"Giving up my youth to take care of someone else's kids because they\
  \ couldn't ruined the idea of having kids myself for me.\" I didn't mean to be rude,\
  \ but it's true. \n\nShe cried. I told her I don't blame her, but that it still\
  \ wasn't a good position to be put in as a teen. I didn't apologise. \n\nAITA?\n\
  \nEdit: When I said \"taking care of someone else's kids because they couldn't\"\
  \ I wasn't trying to be malicious. \nA) She at that moment in time, genuinely couldn't,\
  \ which is why I had to. \nB) I called them 'someone else's kids' because they don't\
  \ feel like siblings anymore, I had to carry way too much responsibility to just\
  \ feel like a big sister. \n\nI wasn't trying to be mean about it, but that's why\
  \ I said it that way.\n\nEdit 2: Yes, I'm aware my mom struggled too, lost her partner,\
  \ had to work. I was there. I never said I don't sympathise or that it was easy\
  \ for her. I'm sympathetic to my mom's situation, but that doesn't change the fact\
  \ that my teenage years where very tough, and I don't want kids because of that.\n\
  \nEdit 3: For the people PMing and commenting about how it's my fault I didn't have\
  \ friends and not my mom's: I wasn't allowed to bring friends home, my mom was scared\
  \ it would distract me from watching my siblings.\n\nLast edit: For everyone asking,\
  \ my mom worked 9-6:30.\n\nActually the last edit: My mom came home around 6:30,\
  \ that didn't mean I only watched the kids till 06:30. I usually was the one who\
  \ cooked dinner and put them to bed, my mom was tired after work."
title: AITA for telling my mom she's the reason I don't want any kids?
