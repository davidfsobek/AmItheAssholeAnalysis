selftext: 'For brief context before I explain what exactly happened here: I''m 27yo
  gay male and there was a dude in high school, let''s call him by his initial B,
  who loved picking on me for being effeminate.


  To be clear, I was never a girly guy on purpose, I just can''t exactly change my
  tone of voice and mannerism that come naturally. B and his friends tormented me
  verbally so much I developed extreme anxiety whenever I was in their proximity.


  They called me every name in the book: fag, sissy, male Ugly Betty (because I was
  overweight and pimply back in high school). Then, things got 100% worse when we
  started having PE together. Long story short, B and his friends were one of the
  main reasons I absolutely, positively detested high school.


  Well now, about a decade later, B came out as bisexual on Facebook through a long,
  public, "heartbreaking" essay elaborating his personal struggles. His post popped
  up on my feed due to a few mutual friends commenting and liking it. Ngl, I was pissed
  off when I read that. Not saying people can''t change, but since B explicitly said
  in his post that he knew he was into boys since kindergarten, IMO that makes the
  fact that he tormented me in high school just for appearing gay even worse.


  Anyway, all of the comments under B''s post were overwhelmingly supportive for him
  "living his truth". That just aggravated me to be honest. I''m not sure whether
  this line of thought makes me bitter or not, but I felt the need to voice my own
  opinion. So I wrote something along the lines of, "That''s such a cute and manipulative
  post B, shame you didn''t consider any of this stuff when you bullied me in high
  school for the exact same things you''re now embracing." I wanted people to see
  that he''s not some sort of a blameless victim of a prejudiced society, as he tried
  to portray himself in the coming-out post.


  Most of our classmates and others attacked me though, saying stuff like "why rain
  on a fellow LGBT person''s parade?" and repeating all the generic stuff about people
  growing up, changing, finding themselves etc. One of my high school classmates even
  PM''d me to say, you don''t even know what B went through since high school, he
  doesn''t need your negativity, you''re being petty and holding a grudge.


  Am I honestly the asshole here? I sure feel like one now, but I still don''t *believe*
  I am in the wrong for criticizing someone who made my high school experience miserable
  and caused my anxiety.'
