selftext: "My niece is 12. She\u2019s going through puberty. \n\nI pick her up from\
  \ school or dance practice sometimes when her parents are working. \n\nI\u2019ve\
  \ noticed over the last few weeks she\u2019s been smelling very ripe. \n\nI was\
  \ driving her home one day and said (this is abridged) \u201CHey I know you\u2019\
  re going through a lot of bodily changes right now and you\u2019re really growing\
  \ up. I think it might be time to start wearing deodorant.\u201D\n\nShe said \u201C\
  I smell?\u201D And I said \u201CYah, just a little. No big deal. Just pick up some\
  \ deodorant, your mom has some.\u201D \n\nHer parents called and were furious saying\
  \ she\u2019s going through a difficult and sensitive time and how dare I make her\
  \ insecure about her natural bodily functions. \n\nI said \u201CSorry, I thought\
  \ if roles were reversed I\u2019d want someone to tell me. Are you really saying\
  \ you didn\u2019t notice her smelling like BO all the time?\u201D \n\nThey said\
  \ she had to come to them and ask for it because someone pushing the issue would\
  \ make her insecure. And by circumventing her psychological timeline I\u2019ve given\
  \ her a complex for the rest of her adolescence, maybe beyond. \n \nI didn\u2019\
  t think it was a big deal at all, but now my niece and her parents are so upset,\
  \ I feel awful!  I\u2019m wondering what I missed here. AITA?"
