selftext: "Throwaway cause reasons.\n\nBackstory: my wife and I have two kids (9F,\
  \ 4M). My wife got pregnant very easily, our first kid was even an \"oops\" baby.\
  \ She had relatively easy pregnancies comparatively, and extremely easy labor comparatively.\
  \ No major complications or anything like that. \n\nOn the other hand, my brother\
  \ and his wife have been trying for years and had to endure medical surgeries for\
  \ my SIL, and utilize IVF in order to finally get pregnant after spending who knows\
  \ how much money. So when they finally got pregnant, they made it a much bigger\
  \ deal then I would say is typical even for a first baby for a couple. For example,\
  \ their baby shower instead of being sort of typical with close friends and family\
  \ at like someone's house and opening gifts and such was at this very expensive\
  \ venue with extravagant catering and it was formal attire and they didn't even\
  \ open presents. My wife was involved in the planning for this, and it was during\
  \ this that she started to kind of get annoyed with my SIL. She would plan certain\
  \ events and fun typical baby games and it would get shot down by my SIL and she\
  \ would basically replace it with her own idea. So that whole event left a bit of\
  \ a sour taste for this whole pregnancy ever since. Otherwise everyone in our family\
  \ has been supportive and excited. The baby is due at the end of this month.\n\n\
  So last night my wife received a Facebook message thread, including my parents and\
  \ other family, from my SIL that said in order for any of us to see the baby (either\
  \ in the hospital after he's born) or later back at home, we would need to bring\
  \ our vaccination records to show that we're up to date on certain vaccinations\
  \ and have gotten our seasonal flu shot. My wife lost it. She started saying how\
  \ completely insane my SIL and brother are being, and basically is over the pregnancy\
  \ and doesn't care to meet our nephew. \n\nWhile I said that I agree they are being\
  \ a bit on the extreme side, I can sort of understand how they're like extra precautious\
  \ because of everything they've been through to even get pregnant, and in all reality\
  \ this is probably their one and only chance. They can't afford to go through IVF\
  \ again and my SIL is too old it would be high risk anyway. My entire family, including\
  \ the kids, are all up to date on our shots, so it's not like it would be hard to\
  \ comply. We would just need to get our records. I also said I can understand in\
  \ this day and age with the antivax community you never know who has what, so I\
  \ can see being careful around strangers, but they should trust family members that\
  \ we wouldn't put our own family (the baby) in harm's way. But overall, I sort of\
  \ understand why they're being careful and it's no big deal.\n\nWell she took this\
  \ as me siding with them over her. She's been angry with me ever since. AITA?\n\n\
  (Also, please don't reply with \"YOu sHOuLd AlWays SiDe wiTH YOur WiFE! hUrrr Dee\
  \ DurRR\". I don't agree with that statement and it's not helpful... Don't bother.)\n\
  \nEdit title: Nephew :/\n\nEdit 2: While my wife didn't explicitly say it, just\
  \ knowing her well enough I think the reason she's upset isn't because they are\
  \ asking for vaccination paperwork in general, but asking us (and my parents). We\
  \ are pretty close. We all live like 30min away and see them frequently and at every\
  \ holiday. They watch our kids, we watch their dog, etc. There's always been full\
  \ trust between us. And I think she feels insulted like we're not being trusted.\
  \ I don't know if that changes anything? For those of you that said you also asked\
  \ for shot records, did that apply to everyone including close family?\n\nEdit 3:\
  \ Holy cow, this blew up since last I checked. First of all, thanks so much for\
  \ the comments, opinions, and advice. To address some common questions/comments...\
  \ 1) No, SIL has no good reason to think we would lie about being vaccinated (or\
  \ anything else for that matter). Once again, we're all really close, if anyone\
  \ in the family was an antivaxxer, we would all know. And there's no previous issues\
  \ with trust that has ever existed. 2) No, we did not ensure family was up to date\
  \ on shots when our kids were born. I feel like the whole antivax thing wasn't as\
  \ prevalent at the time maybe? It was a while ago, don't exactly recall. 3) It is\
  \ highly unlikely my wife is jealous of the baby shower or attention of the pregnancy.\
  \ She's a total introvert and would rather die than have the type of baby shower\
  \ my SIL had. It was more the fact that my SIL rejected all her ideas and basically\
  \ planned it herself. 4) I probably shot myself in the foot on this one with the\
  \ title... But I didn't really \"take a side\", at least I wouldn't consider it\
  \ that. It's not like I said, \"Well hun, they are right and you are wrong\". It\
  \ was more the fact that I wasn't as outraged as my wife about the whole thing that\
  \ made her think I was taking their side (I think?). So take that for what it's\
  \ worth. 5) I appreciate the folks that could also see both sides of the coin...\
  \ I feel like that's what I tried to do here. Maybe I didn't handle it to perfection\
  \ and I agree it will probably blow over (hopefully). Maybe I'll send an update\
  \ if anyone is interested.\n\nEdit 4: Just cause it's hilarious that I actually\
  \ have to address this... But no, I was not implying that just because the baby\
  \ is IVF or their \"one shot\" that the baby's life is more valuable than a more\
  \ typical pregnancy baby. Not quite sure how some folks deduced that. I was merely\
  \ saying that due to those circumstances I could more easily empathize with my SIL's\
  \ somewhat extreme (imo) request for vaccination records, which is why it didn't\
  \ bother me as much as it did my wife."
