selftext: "(Throwaway with names changed because I know a few of my coworkers use\
  \ reddit.)\n\nSo there's this guy at my work, James, who makes derogatory jokes\
  \ about his wife. Any time his spouse comes up in conversation, he'll make one of\
  \ those 'oh, my wife is such a nag, the old ball-and-chain, *women*, eh?' jokes.\
  \  He'll always say it with a big grin and then laugh, but he does it *constantly*.\n\
  \  \nAnd when I say constantly, I mean constantly.  In the three years I've worked\
  \ with James, I've only heard him mention his wife without making a joke along those\
  \ lines maybe three or four times.  It really gets on my nerves to hear him trash\
  \ talk her all the time.  \n\nToday another coworker of ours said that he was making\
  \ plans for his anniversary with his wife, and James butted in and said \"oh, yeah,\
  \ mine's coming up soon, too.  I guess I need to do something or I'll never hear\
  \ the end of it.\"\n\nAnd I kind of lost my temper and asked him \"If that's the\
  \ way you feel why are you still married to her?!\" \n\nJames kind of sputtered\
  \ a bit that he was joking, and I told him that he always talks about being married\
  \ like it's a burden, and that there comes a point when even the funniest jokes\
  \ get old, and that his jokes about his wife haven't ever been funny.\n\nIt kind\
  \ of went to an awkward silence until James left for the day.  Some of my coworkers\
  \ are glad I called him out on it, some of them think what I said went too far.\n\
  \nSo AITA here?  Should I apologize to James tomorrow?"
