selftext: "A month ago, I parked in a spot on a public road (the street I live on)\
  \ that someone had tried to save for themselves using a folding chair. I usually\
  \ won't do that but it was the only spot left. Anyway the next Monday I went to\
  \ take my car to work and someone had spray painted BITCH across the whole side\
  \ of my car. \n\nI went to the cops and it wasn't too hard to figure out what dumbass\
  \ did it, a few neighbors knew who always put the chair out to save the spot, and\
  \ figured it was them. A neighbors doorbell camera feed proved it. I got a $1200\
  \ settlement for the damages, and decided not to use it to fix my car because my\
  \ car's a $2500 junker that I'm planning on replacing within the year anyway.\n\n\
  I instead got my boyfriend who's office has a vinyl sticker printer to print me\
  \ a big red sticker saying BAD, and another that's a \"censoring\" exclamation point\
  \ and I put it on my car so it reads BAD B!TCH now. \n\nMy friends and coworkers\
  \ think it's funny, I work in a trade where much cruder stuff gets tossed around\
  \ every day so it's nbd driving it to work. If anything I've gotten more respect\
  \ for driving my \"bad bitchmobile\" around \n\nBut I've heard from other neighbors\
  \ that it's...\n\n1. Pissing off my neighbor that did it, because it's reminding\
  \ him I took his money and didn't do shit to fix my car\n\n2. Annoying a dad who\
  \ lives on the street because he doesn't want kids seeing it \n\n3. Annoying a couple\
  \ other people who think ot makes our area look trashy\n\nAITA for not covering\
  \ up my vandalized car, and taking humor from it instead?"
