selftext: 'On Thursday evenings my daughter (9F) goes to dance class with her friend
  Anna (9F). My wife told me to pick my daughter and Anna up from school, get them
  something to eat, and take them to dance.


  I pick them up from school and ask where they want to go to eat. My daughter asks
  to go to this noodle place we go to sometimes, and I ask Anna if she would like
  that and she says sure, so we go. We all order and start eating, when suddenly Anna
  looks distressed and said she thinks she is having an allergic reaction. I ask her
  if she has allergies and she says she does to peanuts... and I look in her dish
  and it''s clearly a peanut sauce.


  I rush her to the hospital (we were pretty close so it was quicker than 911 would
  have been), and everything ended up being ok. I felt horrible. I call my wife when
  Anna is in the hospital room, but there is no answer and I do not have Anna''s mother''s
  phone number. So after Anna is given the all clear I immediately take her back to
  her house and explain what happened to her mother.


  Her mother is furious, saying that I could have killed her child. I said back that
  she should have told me about her daughter''s anaphylaxis, why would I assume something
  like that. She responded that you always ask about a child''s allergies before getting
  them food. She also said that she didn''t know I would be getting them dinner (School
  ends at 4 and dance isn''t until 6, so I thought it would be safe to assume I would
  be giving them food..) I apologized for what happened, but still feel like Anna''s
  mother definitely should have let me know in this situation, and also Anna is old
  enough to be aware of her anaphylaxis.


  AITA?'
