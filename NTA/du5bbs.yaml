selftext: 'I''m a very tall woman.


  I''m about 6''5. It''s difficult but I manage. I''m out of town right now visiting
  my brother, his wife and their kids. My SIL is a kind of neurotic, tense person,
  a perfectionist, and she and I have never gotten along, but we''re polite and civil
  for my big brother''s sake. Plus, I love my nieces, so being nice to her is just
  carte blanche.


  They have a small house so while I''m here they''ve had the younger daughter share
  a bed with the older one, giving me the five year old''s bed. I knew right away
  that the little bed was gonna be waaaaaay too short but after my seven hour drive
  I just wanted some sleep. My feet stuck off the end a good foot and a half.


  The next night I just took the pillow and blanket and slept on the floor next to
  the bed. There was a rug so it wasn''t too bad but definitely not the best. The
  next day I waited until everyone was asleep and went out to the sofa. I was still
  too tall but it was better than the floor. Next day SIL asked me not to sleep on
  the sofa via text message after she went to work. That night I slept on the floor
  again and the next morning SIL came in to see if I wanted breakfast and found me
  sleeping there.


  It became this huge thing and culminated with me leaving to stay in the only hotel
  in the small town they live in, which is a thirty minute drive from their ranch.
  Now my brother and SIL are pissed at me, the nieces are sad that I''m not sleeping
  over. AITA for sleeping on the floor or should I have just sucked it up?'
