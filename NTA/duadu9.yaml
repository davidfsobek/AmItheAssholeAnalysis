selftext: 'My sister is 16 and heavily overweight. She''s  5''2 or 5''3 but 170+lbs.
  She''s already pre-diabetic and if she doesn''t lose weight pronto she''ll have
  to go on metformin. Diabetes runs in our family (my mom and grandma both have it)
  and as it is she already has really low energy levels and clumps of her hair is
  falling out!! I''m really worried about her and have tried to introduce her to various
  forms of "fun" exercises (like swimming, those weird indoor cycling classes with
  the EDM and the lights and shit, 30-minute walks, wall climbing) but she absolutely
  HATED it all. The other thing is, she doesn''t eat any fruits or vegetables, except
  maybe potatoes, and bananas when they''re in "acceptable" forms like in chocolate-banana
  smoothies or in banana bread.


  As a last-ditch attempt, a couple of days ago I decided to just take over the family
  menu and feed her dishes that secretly have vegetables in them. For breakfast I
  made green smoothies but add lots of (sugar-free) matcha to explain the "green"
  color and mask the flavors of the fruits and veggies. I make "cheese" sauces out
  of pumpkin and carrots and flavor them with nutritional yeast. I mix crushed cauliflower
  into fried rice, etc etc. I have to lie about them because even if it tastes good,
  if she *knows* there are fruits or veggies she doesn''t like in the dish, she''ll
  immediately stop eating it.


  It was going well until our mom found out the dishes secretly had vegetables in
  it. She started this whole argument about how it was "unethical" to lie to my sister
  about what we were feeding her and it escalated into a yelling match where I told
  my mom she clearly wasn''t worried enough about my sister''s health and that she
  knew nothing about nutrition. (She thinks apple pie is healthy???) My mom has banned
  me from preparing the meals and is guilt-tripping me for lying, but I really think
  I was making an honest effort to help? I feel bad for yelling at my mom but I dunno,
  was I really such an asshole for lying about the vegetables?


  **EDIT:** I really didn''t expect my post would blow up like this. I just want to
  emphasize that I''m not a nutritionist or a doctor, I just listen to what the doctor
  + nutritionist says during the monthly checkups and take that as fact, so thank
  you so much for pointing several things out. I will try to be more self-informed
  in the future. I''ve taken note of her possibly having ARFID, thyroid problems,
  or PCOS and will try to get my mom to get her to a therapist as well as a doctor,
  thanks very much for bringing these up. Also, my mom is really hard-headed but she''s
  still trying, I feel bad that I''ve made such a horrible impression of her. She
  has type 1 diabetes that she has to manage on top of her job and taking care of
  us 2 kids so please don''t say she''s terrible :( Also, everyone asking me for my
  recipes can check my comments, I made a comment on this post detailing how I did
  the cheese sauce and stuff. Thank you very much for your suggestions, I really appreciate
  them.


  **EDIT 2**: My mom has type 1 diabetes, my grandma on my dad''s side has type 2.
  According to the doctor my sister is at risk for Type 2 because of her high blood
  sugar + high cholesterol.'
