selftext: "My wife and I had our first baby a month ago. She prefers to pump a few\
  \ bottles worth of milk at a time and feed the baby from the bottle. She stores\
  \ the bottles in the fridge. \n\n\nMy little brother has never had a girlfriend.\
  \ He acts quite awkward around my wife and other women from what I\u2019ve seen.\
  \ He came to my house last week to see the baby and he noticed the bottles in the\
  \ fridge. \n\n\nYesterday, my wife and I, along with our baby, went over to my parent\u2019\
  s house. My brother knows since he\u2019s in our family group chat. He texted me\
  \ when I was at my parent\u2019s house that he bought my baby some cool clothes\
  \ and will drop them off. He knows my front door pin to get in. \n\n\nWhen I got\
  \ home I saw the cool clothes he bought and thanked him via text. My wife bottle\
  \ fed my baby that night with no issues. Today, however, she said the baby reacted\
  \ very differently to the new bottle she fed her. She coughed much more than usual\
  \ and spat out the milk, which never happened before. So, my wife tasted it and\
  \ said it was cow milk, not her milk. She told me to taste it too and compare it\
  \ with the two other bottles in the fridge. That bottle indeed tasted much more\
  \ like cow milk than the other two.\n\n\nMy wife suspected it was my brother drinking\
  \ her breast milk and swapping out that bottle with cow milk. I agreed that it would\
  \ not be out of character for him to do that. I thought it was a bit fishy he would\
  \ come by and drop off clothes, especially since that was the first time he would\
  \ come to my house when no one was home. \n\n\nI called my brother and asked him\
  \ why he would drop by when we were not home and why he couldn\u2019t wait a few\
  \ hours until we got home. He said he just bought the clothes from the nearby mall\
  \ and it was more convenient to drop them off then. I asked him to please tell me\
  \ the truth if he swapped my wife\u2019s breast milk with cow milk and he vehemently\
  \ denied it. I told him how we found out the bottle contained cow milk and what\
  \ a coincidence it must be. He said he really doesn\u2019t know, but I could hear\
  \ the tremble in his words. I told him that my wife and I don\u2019t believe him\
  \ and if he doesn\u2019t apologize now, we would tell our parents what happened\
  \ and ask what they think. He once again denies doing anything so I hung up. \n\n\
  \nBefore calling my parents, I want to know what you guys think first. Are my wife\
  \ and I just paranoid or do we have good enough reason to believe my brother swapped\
  \ out her breast milk with cow milk?"
