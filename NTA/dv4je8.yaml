selftext: "I know the title looks pretty bad but hear me out! \nI\u2019m a native\
  \ French speaker from Canada, but I have a very pronounced \u201CAcadian/Chiac\u201D\
  \ accent. For those who don\u2019t know, it\u2019s pretty much a mix of French and\
  \ English with some local dialect thrown in there. Pretty common in the maritimes,\
  \ where I still live. I\u2019m perfectly bilingual in both languages.\n\nI started\
  \ dating my boyfriend, who only speaks English, about 4 years ago and spend a lot\
  \ of time with his family, they\u2019ve all been really great, except for one of\
  \ his aunts. She says she was a French teacher in anglophone schools for over 40\
  \ years up until a year ago and even studied in France, and she INSISTS on only\
  \ talking to me in French. I agreed at first since I didn\u2019t want to be rude\
  \ to his family but it\u2019s getting super weird. I don\u2019t understand how she\
  \ was able to teach kids English or how she comes up with most of her sentence,\
  \ like I have to guess 90% of whatever she says and hope I\u2019m right because\
  \ it makes absolutely no sense. (Example: she said \u201Ca la citrouille la tarte\
  \ va bien dans ma bouche\u201D which roughly translates to \u201Cto the pumpkin\
  \ a pie goes well in my mouth\u201D when she meant \u201Cthis pumpkin pie tastes\
  \ delicious\u201D) \nShe constantly criticizes my \u201Caccent\u201D.  and tries\
  \ to correct my pronunciation of certain words, and tells me I need to \u201Cpick\
  \ a language\u201D when I accidentally say something in chiac (speaking proper \u201C\
  fran\xE7ais standard\u201D is actually getting harder for me since I\u2019ve been\
  \ only studying/working in English). \n\nSo last night during dinner she started\
  \ going on about how Acadians were uneducated and made no effort to properly learn\
  \ a language, which is total BS, and obviously weirdly directed at me. For the rest\
  \ of the night I stopped guessing what she was trying to say to me in french, acting\
  \ like I didn\u2019t understand anything, and started correcting her as well - which\
  \ was pretty much every single sentence she said. I wasn\u2019t trying to be rude\
  \ or aggressive about it but after a while she gave up on the French and ignored\
  \ me for the rest of the night.  \nTurns out she was super pissed and told everyone\
  \ I was trying to embarrass her in front of everyone. Looking back I think I might\u2019\
  ve taken it too far by not stopping after 2-3 sentences and I feel bad. My boyfriend\
  \ said I was being bitchy while his mom said she probably deserved it. AITA here?\n\
  \n\nEDIT: Forgot to mention that I told her a few years ago that it\u2019s hard\
  \ for me to fully speak proper French as I spoke chiac all my life, tried to explain\
  \ Acadian culture (she wasn\u2019t having it, surprise) and she stopped for a while\
  \ but is now doing it again."
