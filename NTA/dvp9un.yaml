selftext: "My two year old son is at an age where everyone wants to touch him and\
  \ pinch him. \n\nMy wife and I agreed we wouldn\u2019t force our kids to hug or\
  \ kiss anyone because we want to teach appropriate physical boundaries and ownership\
  \ of your body from an early age. \n\nRecently my grandmother visited and when she\
  \ was leaving my sister directed my son to \u201Cgive Grammy a kiss goodbye\u201D\
  \ and he said \u201Cdon\u2019t want to\u201D and we said \u201Cthat\u2019s fine,\
  \ wave goodbye then.\u201D And he waved and said goodbye. \n\nShe started to say\
  \ \u201Coh, no kiss for Grammy?\u201D But I shut that down with \u201C(son) has\
  \ a lot of ways to express his feelings\u201D and we left it at that. She seemed\
  \ to understand. \n\nMy sister took her to the airport but when she was over later\
  \ she said I was an asshole for not having my son kiss his great grandmother goodbye\
  \ knowing it meant something to her just because he \u201Cdidn\u2019t want to\u201D\
  . \n\nI tried to explain not wanting physical touching isn\u2019t the same as not\
  \ wanting to leave the park or whatever, but she said it\u2019s not as big a deal\
  \ to him to give her a quick kiss as it was for her to feel her great grandson didn\u2019\
  t treasure her visit. \n\nWe\u2019re about to host thanksgiving and there will be\
  \ plenty of family expecting hugs and kisses and physical affection from our son,\
  \ and in a couple years, from our daughter as well. \n\nI was ready to stand my\
  \ ground on this but now my wife and I are less certain after this incident. AITA?"
