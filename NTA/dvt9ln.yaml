selftext: "I kept getting removed for too many characters, so I just made a shorter\
  \ version:\n\nI\u2019m an avid DND player and so is the friend in question.\n\n\
  I told my friend he could host a DND one shot (a one-day DND game) at my house and\
  \ that I was excited to play.  He just told me his plan for the one shot is for\
  \ him (the dm) to play a guy and for all the players to play a girl and try to win\
  \ the guy\u2019s affections - a concept he apparently got from anime.  I\u2019m\
  \ the only guy other than him.  I told him that wasn\u2019t really DND at all. \
  \ There are no stat blocks, no spells, no combat, no life or death, do-or-die missions,\
  \ no classes, no races, nothing that makes up the game of DND.  The only thing that\
  \ makes it close is that it\u2019s technically an RPG.  I told him that I no longer\
  \ wanted to participate (I guess I\u2019m the only one that doesn\u2019t) (I essentially\
  \ told him that\u2019s not the game I agreed to play and that I really don\u2019\
  t think it would be fun for me).  I told him he can still host the game at my house\
  \ if he wants (especially since he has no other house to host it at), but he\u2019\
  s really upset with me because I \u201Cchanged my mind\u201D and won\u2019t participate\
  \ and says it\u2019ll ruin everyone else\u2019s time.\n\nIt should be noted that\
  \ he\u2019s gay so, even though I think the game is pretty weird, he\u2019s not\
  \ trying to play this just to get the girls in the group to hit on him.\n\nI really\
  \ don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m the asshole but I thought I\u2019d get some more\
  \ opinions on whether I\u2019m right or I should just suck it up."
