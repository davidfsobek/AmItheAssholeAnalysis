selftext: "edited to add- to the people out there with curly hair, i hear you and\
  \ i understand! However, my daughter is 4. My husband and i both have worked hard\
  \ to figure out how to care for her hair. He does play an active role in coming\
  \ up with what she needs and i execute it. If i was willing to fight her tooth and\
  \ nail every morning, i could style it into pretty curls, sure. But it is not worth\
  \ it to me or my husband to do that to her because she hates it so much and we are\
  \ not willing to override her bodily  autonomy just to make her hair look nice.\
  \ It's just hair. What i'm doing is just getting the over-night matted rat's nest\
  \ out. She does NOT have course hair. It is fine and smooth like mine and it because\
  \ a matted mess just like mine, it can't be braided or put in a protective style,\
  \ unfortunately. that will just rip her hair out. not that she would tolerate that,\
  \ anyway. She removes anything or any style i've ever tried to do in her hair. even\
  \ if she cooperates while i'm doing it, 5 minutes later, she'll just pull out whatever\
  \ i put in. from french braids to hair clips and headbands. they're all a no-go.\n\
  My husband and i have put a lot of time and effort into finding out exactly how\
  \ to best care for her hair, and this is really it for now. It's not the best for\
  \ her HAIR but it is the best for her well being, as we've decided as her parents.\
  \ We'll revisit her hair care when she's older, i promise. And i would NEVER use\
  \ heat treatments on a child. i don't care if it curls or not. We just want her\
  \ to look half groomed.\n\n\n--------------------------------\nSo I am white my\
  \ husband is black and we have two daughters, ages 2 and 4. My 4 year old looks\
  \ a lot like her (very handsome, if I might add) daddy. But she's got my texture\
  \ hair with a massive amounts of curls that I usually am the one to take care of.\
  \ Yesterday I brushed her hair in to a ponytail and put her in an old, very dated\
  \ (but cute for the time!) outfit from when I was a kid in the 90's and recreated\
  \ a photo of me when I was her age. I thought it was adorable but I received a lot\
  \ of backlash from my \"woke\" friends and family (on my side, for the record. I'm\
  \ not close to his family and they all just \"heart\" any pictures of my kids and\
  \ rarely comment, if they do just to say they like the picture) accusing me of trying\
  \ to make her \"white\". \n\nI've had underhanded comments before from them about\
  \ \"erasing my kid's identity\" for brushing her hair? She's a child. To maintain\
  \ her curls to look good requires quite a bit of time and products. Often she just\
  \ lets me brush the rat's nest out of it and calls it a day. Any time I style it,\
  \ she sticks her hands in it and messes it up. What else can I do? However, doing\
  \ this does brush the curls out until her hair gets wet again. She HATES having\
  \ her hair misted or dampeded and it's too cold for that now anyway. My husband\
  \ doesn't care. He's happy she's clean and fed. \n\nTo wrap this up, I've had more\
  \ than one person say I need to leave my more \"black-passing\" child's image alone\
  \ and let her embrace being black, especially because, get this, my 2 year old is\
  \ more \"white-passing\" with wavy light hair and my blue eyes. Including what I\
  \ feel is dangerous advice to let her play outside without sunscreen. We have no\
  \ idea what her sun tolerance is and I'm not about to deal with a small child having\
  \ a sunburn I gave her on purpose. I have a low sun tolerance and don't tan, just\
  \ burn like a boiled lobster. \n\nI'm going to be honest, this all blows my mind\
  \ a little bit. My husband has never said anything of the sort. I've asked him about\
  \ it and he said I don't need to worry about it. I don't let these people anywhere\
  \ near my kids in person and some of them I can't avoid or just cut off. So am I\
  \ being an asshole?"
