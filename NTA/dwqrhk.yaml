selftext: 'I know this sounds really strange, but there is more to the story that
  leads me to doubt whether I made the correct decision.


  Now for a little backstory, it all started when I was 15, she was a class lower
  then I was, we hit it off and about a month later we started dating and have been
  inseparable since, as a result she met my family, they adore her, I met hers, they
  adore me, we have mutual friends etc. This all changed last month however when we
  had a huge fight when I caught her kissing a good friend of hers, this friend of
  hers is a Lesbian where as my girlfriend is straight, but we were all aware this
  friend always had a thing for her, so when I caught them they were both tipsy and
  I think her friend was taking advantage of that in order to kiss her, well this
  was at a party in full sight of multiple people as they were making out, which is
  when I walked in. To make a long story short I felt humiliated and beyond angry,
  split them up, said some nasty shit to her friend and went home. Shortly after my
  girlfriend arrived, to talk to me, it devolved in a huge fight where she could not
  see the big deal since she was tipsy and she was just kissing a girl so it doesn''t
  count, where as I saw it as her cheating, well after 3 years and a few months I
  broke up with her there and then, she was stunned, said nothing else and I told
  her to get out before allowing her another word in.


  Well I ended up getting over a hundred messages from mutual friends, from her, from
  her family, from my family so I ended up having to block some friends, her family,
  told my family to mind their own business and of course I blocked my now ex-girlfriend,
  but my girlfriend would make new accounts, would stop by my house etc just to talk
  to me, to a level where it resembled stalking.


  Well it finally stopped until, I entered my mom''s house and there she was, with
  her dad and one of my previous friends(One of the people I blocked former mutual
  friend) and the friend she was kissing, alongside my mom.


  Well this is where it took a turn to insane territory, my mom said my now ex girlfriend
  had been talking to her all this time and begging her to get me to talk to her and
  she said she agreed and we should make up, the friend she was kissing apologized
  etc and I was just stunned, I told her, this was beyond insane, to mind her own
  business and that I would no longer be speaking to her. Well some crying and yelling
  later where my ex followed me around the house begging to talk to me, I grabbed
  the essentials from my room, put it in my car, called my dad to let him know I was
  staying with him and left. I have not spoken to my mom in over 3 weeks and I have
  been ignoring my friends who even bring my ex up, where as my ex still periodically
  tries to get in touch with me.


  Where I am doubting whether I am being too harsh is because it is obvious my ex
  roped my mom in to doing this, so AITA?


  &#x200B;


  Edit: So let me just clarify something, since a lot of people seem to somehow rationalize
  their judgement by toning down the kiss to some friendly peck between girls, I figured
  this would speak for itself that her giving another girl a peck on the lips would
  not piss me off, they were making out, hands going places, spit being swapped, tongues
  entering mouths you know, making out, the fact I had to clarify this seems a bit
  weird.'
