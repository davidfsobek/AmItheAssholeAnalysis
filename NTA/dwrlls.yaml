  \ for 5 years. I decided to propose, but she rejected me. The next day, we had a\
  \ talk. She realized that she was gay, since \"I've been trying to hard to please\
  \ myself from men\". We broke up.\n \nThe very next day, I get bombarded with text\
  \ messages. My friends asked if this was true, and they linked me to a post. It\
  \ was a Facebook (who uses Facebook) post (exposing me) about me cheating. She said\
  \ that's why we broke up. Now I usually am not evil, but this pissed me off. She\
  \ was destroying my reputation, for god knows why. I simply commented that the real\
  \ reason that we broke up was because she is gay. People didn't believe me, until\
  \ my ex literally screamed at me for outing her. Then a lot of people started to\
  \ call her out for her lies. I know I'm probably a huge asshole. Though I feel like\
  \ she deserves it.\n \nBut alas, AITA?\n \nNo. I did not cheat on her.\n \nYes.\
  \ I did have sex with someone the day that we broke up. But it was after."
