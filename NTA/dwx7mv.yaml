selftext: 'I (18M) have a really close friend (18F) who has recently started faking
  a british accent, it''s so clear to everyone that it''s fake. Honestly it makes
  it hard for me to do anything w/ her because people notice right away. Parties?
  Fake accent. Class? Fake accent. Talking with friends? Fake accent, everyone can
  tell it''s fake, and they always question when she started faking her accent or
  question if it''s actually real.


  The final straw was when I invited her over for dinner w/ my parents and she tried
  using it on them. They instantly noticed and looked at her and then me. It was so
  embarrassing and the rest of the dinner was them asking when she started using a
  fake accent, and her pretending to be oblivious "*whut are yew tawlking abowt?*".


  I have been trying to ignore her, but my parents and her parents are really close,
  and they''ve helped us financially when we have been unstable, so they told me to
  suck it up.


  I was hanging out with her one day, and she was doing her fake accent. I started
  talking to her back in an australian accent, and every time she asked me what I
  was doing I said "mate, I dont know what your talking about mate...dingo dango mate."


  She hasn''t really been doing it around me, but I kinda feel bad now. I just wish
  she would go back to being the "normal" her that I grew up with. AITA?'
