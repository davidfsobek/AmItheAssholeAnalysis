selftext: 'I own several properties and rent them out. My son is 20 and goes to school
  near one of the properties (10-unit luxury apartment). It''s cheaper to let him
  live there rent-free than living in the dorms. Obviously the condo is MUCH larger
  (three bedrooms, 2 bath, gym on-site) private, quieter, etc. I put several conditions
  on his living there rent-free. Nothing shocking; no smoking (he doesn''t), no parties,
  keep the place clean, turn off the lights when you leave AND no moving people in.
  A couple of months ago, I noticed that the utilities at the condo skyrocketed because
  he moved in his girlfriend. His girlfriend was having issues with her roommates.
  To add insult to injury, this girl moved in her friend who came out to LA to be
  an actress and had no where to go. I told my son I didn''t give a fuck what problems
  these girls were having - no roommates or he can move out. He lied to me about their
  moving out. I told him again - no roommates - or leave. He started playing with
  semantics how they''re not really moved in and just spends a night or two. I don''t
  give a fuck. I could be charging 4K a month for the condo (this is Westwood, CA)
  and by letting them stay there, it puts me at risk of their claiming tenant rights.
  That could cost me tens of thousands of dollars in lost rent and legal fees. And
  if that''s not bad enough, his girlfriend talks about the condo as if it''s "their"
  condo.

  Rather than fight with him, again, I asked my property manager to begin the eviction
  process on my son. I treat him no differently than people who don''t pay their rent.
  I told my son I ain''t paying for his boarding at school and his ass is going to
  pay rent if he moves back home. The commute from my house to UCLA is a bitch. He''s
  not 12. I don''t owe him anything. He should be kissing my ring for paying for tuition
  and keeping him on my insurance plan.

  And, no, I am not officially renting out the place to either of them. They don''t
  have money, the credit or respect to qualify to rent one of my properties out.'
