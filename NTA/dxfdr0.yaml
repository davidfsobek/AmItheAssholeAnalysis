selftext: "I (F 22) work part time at my father\u2019s restaurant/deli as a cashier\
  \ while I\u2019m in school. I\u2019m mixed, so my natural hair is very thick and\
  \ curly textured and since I stopped keeping it in a protective style, I like to\
  \ where it out in a semi Afro. One day, a frequent customer (an old man, probably\
  \ around 70) says, \u201Cyou are such a pretty girl, you shouldn\u2019t wear your\
  \ hair like that. You\u2019d look much better if you went to a salon and gotten\
  \ it straightened out\u201D. \nI said back to him \u201Cmaybe you should have some\
  \ hair before you comment about mine\u201D. He\u2019s old, so he\u2019s a bit bald.\
  \ He called me rude and nasty, then flagged down my dad about it. I got in trouble\
  \ but I refused to apologize. My dad has also commented on my hair before. I told\
  \ the customer, \u201CI\u2019m not trying to make it about race but my dad is an\
  \ older white guy as well, and I\u2019m not white. My hair will never be straight\
  \ unless I flat iron it\u201D. But I\u2019m not apologizing and I don\u2019t feel\
  \ bad about saying what I said."
