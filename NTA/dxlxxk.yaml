selftext: 'Two days ago, I was on a long-haul flight. I was sitting in an aisle seat.
  Since I haven''t seen Games of Thrones yet, I was looking forward to binge watch
  the first season. I made myself comfortable and set up my tablet. An hour or two
  into watching, the woman two rows behind me tipped on my shoulder and told me that
  I need to turn it off immediately. A little bit confused, I asked why. She told
  me that her young son could see the show playing on my tablet and it''s totally
  not suited for such young children because of the sex and violence involved in it.
  While I agree with that, I told her that I''m not going to turn it off. She then
  basically told me that I am an asshole for not considering other people around me.
  Is she right?

  Edit: I want to clarify a few things that were mentioned in the comments:


  \- I was wearing headphones all the time.


  \- It was a flight with Swiss from Europe to a city in the United States. The in-flight
  entertainment system offered various movies and tv shows that were also not suited
  for children. However I have to admit that probably none was as bad as GoT. However,
  none of these shows was censored as far as I can tell.


  \- I''m not sure exactly where (aisle, middle or window) the kid was sitting since
  it was behind me and I think they switched seats frequently.'
