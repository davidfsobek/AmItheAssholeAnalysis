selftext: "Throwaway btw\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo recently my(15M) mother and her husband\
  \ went through a rough patch because he won't help around the house, barely contributes\
  \ to their joint account, and keeps pissing the bed after he gets fucking shitfaced(every\
  \ other week).  \n\nYesterday before he came back home to talk about it, mom asked\
  \ what I thought of him, and I told her I hated him. For the reasons listed above,\
  \ and she caters to his every need and i have to as well. I have some leftovers\
  \ from my favorite steakhouse. They are eaten and my mom says he ate them as always\
  \ and she tells me its selfish to get mad about it. I have to be his alarm clock.\
  \ He plays xbox as well so hes always taking my battery packs and when i tell him\
  \ to stop he just rolls his eyes.\n\nSo after I told her this she started crying\
  \ and some family have told me i shouldve kept my opinion to myslef?\n\nAITA?"
