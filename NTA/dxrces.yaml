selftext: "I'm m23 and I'm 1.5 years into a software sales gig after graduating, and\
  \ my GF and her friends are all in law school and are 22. They see sales as being\
  \ a shitty job with shit pay and basically think I scam people. I made 88k last\
  \ year and I'm on track to get promoted to a position that will pay 120k (50/50\
  \ split). \n\nThey usually have snide remarks about how hard it was to get into\
  \ law school, how much lawyers make etc. I usually just nod my head and agree, but\
  \ last night we were all at a bar. And her friends who are all girls btw started\
  \ going on again how they only would date a guy in law or finance field because\
  \ they're smart and make money and then one chimed in saying \"what about sales?\"\
  \ And they were all like definitely not and started laughing, I just had enough\
  \ and told them that have fun being 90k in debt or wasting 90k of your parents money\
  \ because the market for lawyers in our city (Toronto) is extremely saturated and\
  \ they'll be likely to even find a job that pays 70k here. \n\nThey got super pissed\
  \ at me and basically called me a broke asshole and my gf also got mad because she's\
  \ in law school too. \n\nAITA?"
