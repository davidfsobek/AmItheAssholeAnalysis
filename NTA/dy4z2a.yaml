selftext: 'I''m the owner of a daycare. Our entrance requirements are fairly lax compared
  to some others in the area, and because of this, we tend to accept children of lower
  income families or children with behavioral problems, etc. Not all of our children
  are like this, but the proportion of them is bigger than others.


  We have a policy (which I''ll say is very common with daycares) about late pickups.
  For us it''s $3 per minute late. Some others in our city are $5, some are up to
  $10. The policy is in place because our employees, to be blunt, have places to be
  after work. Some have second jobs, some have to pick up their own kids, etc. If
  a parent is late to pick up, by law we need to have at least two caretakers here
  for even just one child. So this $3/min is to pay for the employees, the daycare
  sees none of it.


  Last week, a mother was just over three hours late. We know she''s of the aforementioned
  low income bracket family and we know she''s a single mother, too. Her child is
  a darling, though. When we spoke about the late fee she got fairly upset and we
  reassured her it would be on her next billing cycle.


  I wasn''t on premises when this happen, but if I had been, I would have volunteered
  to stay late. This would drop it to $300, but I wasn''t there. I can''t stiff my
  employees or change the fee or waive a portion of it without dipping into my own
  pockets. I also can''t ask my employees to be altruistic here because it''s their
  money by rights (and the agreement I have with them). If she had even phoned in
  advance, I could have driven up to help out, but she didn''t.


  When December rolls around and she refuses to pay the money, she will be kicked
  out of the daycare. We don''t know if she''ll be accepted into a different one because
  of who we accept and our (cheaper) rates. She''ll have to work juggling babysitters
  which I don''t even know if she can afford.


  I feel between a rock and a hard place whether I should extend a generous hand and
  just comp it. $600 is a lot of money and I already have the two employees asking
  about it, excited at the "bonus" they''re receiving.


  AITA?'
