selftext: "I am a woman in my 20s who has very short hair. It isn't just short, it\
  \ is straight up a men's cut, as I am very masculine/butch looking in general. For\
  \ the past couple years I have been getting my hair cut at a barber, since it's\
  \ cheaper and they never try to push me to have a more feminine pixie cut. \n\n\
  My barber moved away recently, so I have been looking for someone new. At the recommendation\
  \ of my male friend, I found a place that looked good. I walked in and requested\
  \ a haircut, and the barber looked at me strangely. He said they don't do women's\
  \ haircuts. I clarified that I just wanted a men's barber haircut, but still he\
  \ refused, telling me to go to a salon. I was shocked, since this is a big diverse\
  \ city and short hair on women isn't THAT uncommon. \n\nAfter he kicked me out,\
  \ I felt embarrassed and shocked. I went on the LGBT Facebook page for my city and\
  \ made a post that said \"gender non-conforming women, don't bother with this barber.\
  \ He doesn't serve us.\"\n\nThe post went kind of viral in the group, getting thousands\
  \ of comments and likes. One of my friends saw the post and told me it was too much,\
  \ and that I could seriously hurt a small business. I thought it was appropriate\
  \ but as the post gets bigger I'm having doubts. AITA?"
