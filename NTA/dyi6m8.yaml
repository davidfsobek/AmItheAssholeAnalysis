selftext: "BACKSTORY:\n\nI failed my first 400-level\_ physical chemistry test 2 months\
  \ ago. I barely passed my second one last month.I noticed I scored significantly\
  \ below class average on both and the curve wasn\u2019t quite what I expected it\
  \ to be. (That\u2019s ok, labs + hw keep my grade at a high B)\n\nSide Note: The\
  \ class is about 60 people. Unbeknownst to me, It fills up quickly every semester\
  \ because people think the professor is \u2018easy\u2019. I didn\u2019t know this.\
  \ The class just fit my schedule and I certainly didn\u2019t think it was \u2018\
  easy\u2019 after those 2 exams.\n\nHere\u2019s the catch: Our professor is old and\
  \ I noticed during exams that many people were suspiciously using their phones.\
  \ I heard rumors that someone had posted the test questions to a relatively well-known\
  \ site (it will remain unnamed)\_ and some students had used that to score A\u2019\
  s and B\u2019s. (We can\u2019t really use the site for homework help because of\
  \ our homework structure, but a lot of us use it for test review & test prep, which\
  \ is extremely helpful).\_Our tests are LONG -we get 2 and a half hours for each\
  \ test- which gives these students plenty of time to post the questions and receive\
  \ the answers online.\_\n\nEXAM DAY:\n\nI was EXTREMELY irritated when I heard this.\
  \ This rage really fueled me and I over-prepared for Test 3. I studied like crazy\_\
  \ for it because I felt like these cheating students were robbing me of points from\
  \ a regular curve. I was able to finish the test in about 45 mins of the given time.\
  \ I didn\u2019t know everything, but I felt pretty great about what I turned in.\_\
  \ I was the second student done with the exam and felt pretty good as I wrapped\
  \ it up.\_\n\nOnce I finished and began walking out, I looked around and saw a ton\
  \ of people cheating. I was so angry and so distraught, that I used my free time\
  \ after the test to go on the site and see if my peers had posted the test questions.\
  \ Of course they had. I had memorized all of the questions (there was only 6) and\
  \ found 4 of the questions had been posted online.\_ I answered ALL of them incorrectly,\
  \ though I made the process look somewhat legitimate. I realized that if I answered\
  \ those questions first, the real site tutors wouldn\u2019t answer them in the given\
  \ time (I was right).\_\n\nPRESENT DAY:\n\nI scored a high B, and the curve put\
  \ my grade at an A.\_\n\nI had the fourth-highest score on the exam.\n\nMost students\
  \ failed, even though I found this test to be much easier and much more manageable\
  \ than the previous two. I looked at the tests of my peers as we compared results.\
  \ We always compare the partial-credit points to make sure our grades are fair.\
  \ I saw that a LOT of them (I\u2019d estimate about 13-15 students based on what\
  \ I saw ) used the \u201Dfake\u201D methods I had used on those incorrect answers.\_\
  \ More students failed this test than the second test, and it was pretty evident\
  \ that I\u2019d screwed some of the cheating students.\_\n\nI honestly can\u2019\
  t say I feel bad about what I did. I worked hard, and their lazy efforts directly\
  \ impacted my GPA and my future.\_\n\nEDIT: \nA common argument I see here is \u201C\
  See you studied and did better! Just keep doing that!\u201D \nI studied like a maniac.\
  \ I didn\u2019t go out, didn\u2019t attend meetings, just had total focus on this\
  \ one test. It\u2019s a completely unsustainable level of study and was only possible\
  \ because I didn\u2019t have much going on in my other classes."
