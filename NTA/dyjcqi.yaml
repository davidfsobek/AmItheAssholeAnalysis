selftext: "I've been expecting my first child this year. Last year, my parents booked\
  \ and paid for a cruise around the same time I was due seeing as I wasn't even pregnant\
  \ and none of us knew I'd be having one at the time. The cruise was a month long,\
  \ around Europe. I ended up giving birth about a week and a half after they left.\
  \ Given their position someone off the coast of Norway or Sweden I couldn't call\
  \ them. I realized when my new daughter was born that my parents would be returning\
  \ to the United States two days before my mom's birthday and I decided to wait and\
  \ sort of present her new granddaughter on her birthday. I thought it would be sweet.\n\
  \nAnyway, so mom and dad's plane lands, they give us a call. I have my husband tell\
  \ my dad that I'd rather they visit on mom's birthday because I've been under the\
  \ weather but I'd never not see my mom on her birthday. They agreed and I got things\
  \ ready, wrapped the present I'd ordered, cleaned the house up a little, my husband\
  \ baked a cake and fixed dinner. \n\nAnd then everything went ass over tea kettle.\
  \ Mom was incredibly unhappy, to say the least. In our house you come inside right\
  \ into the living room so I sat in my husband's La-Z-Boy facing the door with the\
  \ baby, tried not to pull a stitch. Mom saw the baby and her face fell. She turned\
  \ around, grabbed my dad, and they stormed out. They didn't answer our calls or\
  \ call us for about three days and when they did, it was my dad, who said it was\
  \ the epitome of selfishness to have done what we did. He said that I should have\
  \ called them when the baby was born and they could have come straight home.\n\n\
  My main reason for not calling them when she was born, well, for one, they were\
  \ on a ship in the middle of the ocean, I couldn't have called them anyway. My second\
  \ reason being that they had shelled out nearly 5 Grand for this cruise and I didn't\
  \ want them to have wasted their money. I mean, yeah it's their first grandchild\
  \ but it's not really that big of a deal in the grand scheme of things, and until\
  \ she's about two months old she'll basically be the same as when she was born.\
  \ I mean, I love her to death but, let's face it, she's a newborn baby, she's boring\
  \ as hell, and she basically sleeps all the time. And they would have missed the\
  \ birth anyway since she came in the middle of the night. They wouldn't have met\
  \ her until she was, at minimum, four or five days old. They met her when she about\
  \ three and a half weeks old.\n\nAnyway, it's been about three more weeks since\
  \ they got home, my daughter Joanna is six and a half weeks old, and my parents\
  \ still haven't met her. My mom won't talk to me, and my dad said that they just\
  \ aren't in the right frame of mind to meet her. I feel such guilt and anguish over\
  \ this. My parents were so excited when I was pregnant and they were forever going\
  \ on about being eager to be grandparents. \n\nHave I made some huge error of judgement?\
  \ Did I inevitably do something tasteless and rude? AITA?"
