selftext: 'A bunch of people from my department at work went for drinks on Friday
  after work. Everyone was having a good time and there were about 20 of us there
  (from about 30 people in our department). I go to the bathroom, and as I am about
  to exit the hall to the bathroom I hear my co-worker say my name from around the
  corner of the wall. Perhaps I shouldn''t have eavesdropped, but curiosity/suspicion
  got the best of me and I did.


  I overheard a conversation of three guys in my department making a "hot list" (they
  actually referred to it as that), which involved ranking every woman in the department
  from first to last. I was upset and disturbed. I was quite friendly with 2/3 of
  the guys, actually. Yesterday morning I tell HR and they state that they have a
  zero-tolerance policy for actions like this. All three men were fired first thing
  this morning, and now I feel terrible.


  I hated the way they were talking about women, but I didn''t think they should be
  fired. With that said, we work for a large company that I know takes complaints
  like this seriously, and would not really miss these 3 guys, so deep down I suppose
  I knew it was a possibility when I complained. Nobody knows that I am the person
  who reported them, and I''ve overheard people say that the person is a "snitch".
  I''m wondering if I should have just confronted them at the bar and told them how
  it made me feel instead, but at the time I didn''t feel comfortable doing that.
  I especially feel bad because I had a fairly good relationship with two of the guys.


  AITA?


  INFO 1: It was not a formal work event, but our supervisor organized everyone going
  out for drinks


  INFO 2: A lot of people are insisting that I am upset because I was low on the list.
  I tried to avoid making this the focus, but with all the comments I feel like I
  have to address it. I was high on the list, and was not offended about my placement;
  I was offended about the fact that they were making a list in the first place. I
  hate that I even have to write this


  **ETA: wow this is just about the most toxic thing that has ever happened to me.
  I came here for judgment on whether I am an asshole in this situation, and I have
  gotten numerous personal messages calling me ugly, a bitch, fat, a nazi, psycho,
  etc. I really think something needs to be done about this sub, although admittedly
  I''m not sure what, because I can''t believe this is the response for somebody using
  this sub for its intended purpose**


  update: I will be speaking to HR about the messages I received'
