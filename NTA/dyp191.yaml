selftext: 'UPDATE: My Dad heard the whole thing and told my mother about it, who was
  working in the kitchen. They both (politely) excused themselves afterwards and drove
  over to my place to talk about it. My Dad drove my half of the groceries to my cousin''s
  place and then came back. There''s now a massive feud on our family WhatsApp with
  two groups:


  1) Family who are sticking up for me and telling other people to stop provoking
  me (mostly older relatives).


  2) People who are saying I''m an asshole (mostly the younger generation).


  &#x200B;


  My cousin and her boyfriend (soon-to-be-married) were having their baby shower and
  the whole family was invited to the party. My mother and aunts love to cook so they
  wanted to gather the ingredients and make a huge dinner themselves. I drove my car
  and my father drove his, and we basically pushed the shopping carts along and got
  our credit cards ready while the women shoveled everything they wanted into the
  carriages.


  We finally got everything to my cousin''s place and we started off-loading my Dad''s
  car first. While I was inside, I got a chance to say hi to my cousin to congratulate
  her on her baby shower. The conversation started off light, but took a weird turn.
  She asked me how my parents raised me, and specific details like if they grounded
  me, what kinds of punishment they used, what I did when I was little and what regrets
  I had as a kid that I would change. I thought they were trying to learn how to raise
  their child, but it was weird because I''m a single guy. They would''ve been better
  off asking my parents about these things.


  Here''s where things get dark. I ask my cousin why she''s asking me all this, and
  she says, "I just want to raise my baby better than you," That made no sense because
  I never raised any babies. The vibe I got was definitely that it was an insult but
  on the off-chance she wasn''t intentionally being rude, I just laughed it off and
  said, "Well I''m no Bill Gates, or Steve Jobs, but I do alright for," I assumed
  she meant that she wanted to raise her baby to be better than me, which is fine
  since parents want the world for their kids.


  Nope, she just kept going. "Well that''s true. Did your parents ever think you''d
  turn out this way?"


  I said, "Well I think they just wanted me to be happy,"


  Her, "Are you?"


  Me, "Well I''m definitely happy for you, congratulations!" (I''m trying reaaaaaaally
  hard to steer things away from me).


  Her, "Thanks. Do you ever plan on having kids?"


  Me, "I just gotta find the right person, but until then I''m gonna enjoy life as
  is. There''s no need to stress out wanting something else and taking what we have
  for granted."


  Her, "Sure... Well I''m younger than you and I already have a family. Don''t wait
  too long... or else you might ending up dying alone," I ask her directly what she
  meant. She just laughs, shrugs, and leaves. I her again and she says, "Don''t get
  angry at me, you''re the one who refuses to go out and meet people. If you bothered
  to leave your house every once in a while maybe you''d have a family of your own
  by now. I just don''t want my baby to end up like you,"


  Everyone within earshot was dead-silent. I just stared at her for who knows how
  long and she just ends up rubbing her belly and waddling away.


  I leave, taking my car home and halfway there, I realize half the groceries are
  still in my car. At this point, I could have driven back and dumped it on the porch
  buuuuuuuuuuuut I decided Fuck It, screw her. I ignored all calls and texts, and
  just took a nap.'
