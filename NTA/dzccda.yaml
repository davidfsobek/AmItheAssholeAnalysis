selftext: "I'm M35, my wife is f28, we've been married for 3 years now. My dad is\
  \ 65 and retired now with a small but decent pension, my mom passed away when I\
  \ was 10 and my dad never remarried and never had another relationship to my knowledge.\
  \ He raised me and my sister by himself and worked 3 jobs for over 10 years to support\
  \ my sister and I through university. My dad is the hardest working person I've\
  \ ever known and heard of, he is my inspiration and my hero. He was born in a tin\
  \ hut in rural Bangladesh and came to Canada with nothing and worked tirelessly\
  \ everyday to help himself out. I am very successful and have been taking care of\
  \ my dad since I graduated uni and I provide him with about $1,000 a month and my\
  \ sister who's a social worker gives him about $300. His house is paid off and I\
  \ paid for a full renovation to his place this year which my wife wasn't too happy\
  \ about but his place needed major work. \n\nMy wife came to me last week and suggested\
  \ I stop giving my dad 1k a month as he now gets a small pension from work and an\
  \ old age pension from the govt and he basically has no bills except for minimal\
  \ utilities, food, gas on a benz I bought him for his 65th bday and personal stuff.\
  \ I told her that I want him to chill now that he's older and worked hard his whole\
  \ life and the extra 1k I give him helps him eat at a better restaurant, get a nicer\
  \ suit, go on holidays etc. He also started seeing a woman who's in her 40's and\
  \ they're pretty happy so I'm extremely happy for my dad. The money helps with dates\
  \ and stuff like that and gives him a better standard of living. My wife just basically\
  \ put her foot down and told me that we need to save more but we don't I pulled\
  \ in 500k last year, she made around 110k and we are doing very well and have no\
  \ kids and I own our condo we live in outright. She basically called me an asshole\
  \ for guilting her into giving money to my dad and said he's a grown man and can\
  \ figure things out himself. \n\nAITA?"
