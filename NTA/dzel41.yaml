selftext: "My wife and I have been together for 6+ years. She has changed on some\
  \ things since we got together, but is still really messy. \n\nI am tired of her\
  \ feeling like I am naggy, but I have finally had enough. I fucking hate that she\
  \ eats in the bed and that there are crumbs on the sheets sometimes. I don't like\
  \ that she leaves clothes on the floor. I don't like that she wears my clothes without\
  \ permission and then I can't find them when I want them.\n\nOur 3 year old also\
  \ sleeps in our queen size bed (we agreed to this until he wants his own bed.) He\
  \ is incredibly cute, but he squirms all goddam night. \n\nI need my own space.\
  \ These things aside, she is a really warm, driven, and fun person to be around.\
  \ She says I'm being ridiculous.  AITA for drawing the line? I feel like I should've\
  \ done this shit way sooner, if anything."
