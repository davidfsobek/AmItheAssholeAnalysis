selftext: "Long story short, a few years ago my now ex-wife was cheating and my son\
  \ caught them in the act. He told me and I\u2019m now divorced with his mom. She\u2019\
  s with the other guy now. My son is 19 now and is in college \n\nI know he has lost\
  \ all respect and affection for his mom since then, but he\u2019s tried his best\
  \ to maintain a relationship I guess. I don\u2019t really know much since we don\u2019\
  t talk about her when we spend time together. I\u2019ve neither encouraged nor discouraged\
  \ him to repair his relationship with his mother. In my opinion, he\u2019s an adult\
  \ and it\u2019s his decision to make. I couldn\u2019t care less either way since\
  \ I have a great relationship with my son and that\u2019s all that matters to me\n\
  \nAnyway, I get a call from my ex in tears yesterday that my son was very disrespectful\
  \ to her. Apparently they got into an argument and he told her \u201CThe only difference\
  \ between you and a whore is that a whore actually gets paid\u201D.  She threw a\
  \ tantrum and starts accusing me of poisoning him against her and demanding he apologizes\
  \ to her. I simply told her I\u2019ll talk to him and hung up.\n\nI talked to my\
  \ son and his exact words were he \u201Cwas sick of her hypocrisy and being morally\
  \ lectured by an adulteress\u201D.  I told him that his mom called him and expects\
  \ and apology. He said there\u2019s no way he\u2019ll apologize to her and if I\u2019\
  ll force him to do so. I told him that I\u2019ll do no such thing since it\u2019\
  s not my responsibility to make sure he gets along with his mother and it\u2019\
  s his decision. He was very grateful \n\nI suppose I could put my foot down and\
  \ force him to apologize to his mother but then again it wouldn\u2019t be a sincere\
  \ apology anyway. Why should I potentially damage my relationship with my son for\
  \ a person that cheated on me anyway ?"
