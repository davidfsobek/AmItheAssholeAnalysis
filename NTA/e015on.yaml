selftext: "Heya. \n\nSo this happened a few days ago, and I'm still pretty worried\
  \ about whether I'm an asshole or not. \n\nI take the bus to and from work and it's\
  \ quite a long commute. Background: \n\n I have epilepsy. I have a seizure alert\
  \ dog, and he comes with me on the bus. Because hes trained to do all kinds of support\
  \ tasks, hes a large breed dog (sheepdog/poodle cross). \n\nIve had a lot of seizures\
  \ on the bus, so I have a hard time mentally dealing with the commute every day.\
  \ To accommodate his size and to make me comfortable, I sit in the disability seating\
  \ section if it's available so he can lay beneath/between my legs and out of the\
  \ way. \n\nNow onto the story: \n\nI'm on the bus ride home, and I found a seat\
  \ in the disability section. I was about 2 stops from my home, and  I was starting\
  \ to have a few auras, so my dog turned around and was facing me/alerting me. The\
  \ next thing I know, I see a flash. \n\nI look up, and a man sitting near me was\
  \ holding up his phone and taking a picture of me. I was in a bit of a rough state,\
  \ so I asked him to delete it. I was probably firmer than I usually would be, but\
  \ my dog was alerting me and I had about 10-15 mins to get home. \n\nThe man was\
  \ stuttering and saying things like \"I just wanted a picture he was being so cute\
  \ and I saw his ID badge (he has one attached to his vest that says \"seizure alert\
  \ dog\").\" I asked him again to delete the pic and then he goes \"my daughter has\
  \ epilepsy and it would be important to her to see a working seizure alert dog\"\
  \ \n\nI told him there were plenty of resources online and made him show me that\
  \ he deleted it. \n\nI was then at my stop and ran home.\n\nI felt bad, because\
  \ I do epilepsy activism work so I felt for him but I was really uncomfortable with\
  \ someone taking a picture of me while my seizure alert dog in the disability section\
  \ just felt wrong. \n\nShould I have just let him keep the picture? AITA?\n\nEdit\
  \ to clear up some things: \n\n-I dont care about legality, just the asshole nature\
  \ of the situation\n-I'm a female :) \n-I live in Canada\n-While I dont have exclusive\
  \ photosensitive epilepsy, flashing lights make my auras worse \n-If he had asked\
  \ me, I would have gotten out of the way and let him take a picture of my dog. Hes\
  \ super cute so I get it.\n\n\n\nEdit: I didnt know about the dog tax! Attached:\
