selftext: 'Tomorrow is my 25th birthday, and my close group of friends and I have
  decided to celebrate at a pretty high-end steakhouse. There are six people in our
  inner circle, and we all pretty much consider one another brothers.


  Now, one of them became a vegan last year, which we were all extremely supportive
  of. We tried his vegan dishes and heard him out for his reasoning for switching
  his diet. No problem.


  However, recently, he''s become much more blatant and semi obnoxious about his insistence
  that we all adopt his vegan lifestyle. I''m assuming this is a result of the increased
  conversation about environmental issues and climate change. He''ll lecture us any
  time he sees us eating meat, and will even go as far as to make gag noises when
  we go to take a bite. It went from being lighthearted in nature to being extremely
  condescending and passive-aggressively rude.


  So as a result, our friend group came to the conclusion it would be best for him
  not to attend my dinner since it will be at an expensive steakhouse and his options
  for what he can eat will be limited anyways. And honestly, the last thing I want
  is to be lectured on my birthday when we''re splurging on $50 steaks. It just ruins
  the vibe.


  My vegan friend has found out and is extremely upset about his non-invitation. However,
  he''s also upset about our choice of venue, and accused me of being purposefully
  exclusionary and told me I should have picked a restaurant that we all could have
  enjoyed. On my birthday. I pointed out that we all went to a vegan restaurant for
  his birthday this year, and while none of us particularly cared for the food, no
  one complained. I haven''t gotten a response.


  So, I suppose this is a two-parter.


  AITA for choosing a steakhouse for my birthday dinner when one of my best friends
  is vegan?


  And AITA for not inviting my close friend to my birthday dinner?

  EDIT


  Wow, I wasn''t expecting so many responses, thanks, guys!


  To clarify on some things I didn''t include in the original post:


  We have talked to him about his behavior and how we find it rude, but when confronted,
  he''ll pivot by saying how he''s only looking out for our best interests by encouraging
  us to be vegan. And the behavior persists.


  Second, after dinner, we''re all heading to a club for drinks and we have a private
  table to continue my birthday celebration. He was invited to that, but now he is
  refusing to come because of the dinner. I love the kid to death, but I feel like
  we''ve aged out of this sort of juvenile behavior. And I''d rather my birthday not
  be marred by drama. I''ll have a chat with him later on and hopefully, we can come
  to a resolution.'
