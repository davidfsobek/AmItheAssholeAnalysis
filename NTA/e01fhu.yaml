selftext: 'About 6 months ago a woman drove off a very busy road, up into the parking
  lot at my work, and hit my truck. She must have been going at least 40mph and hit
  directly on the wheel of my truck because it turned my truck 90 degrees with very
  little visible body damage. To top it off, she had no insurance.


  After all was said and done, she caused about $18,000 in damage for which I had
  to pay out of pocket about $3,800 (deductible, rental car, repair costs my a-hole
  insurance company refused to pay). Additionally, since she didn''t have insurance,
  I can''t recover the diminished value of my truck which I think is at least $5,000
  that I will never get back. Obviously this amount will go down as my truck ages
  but I''m pretty much stuck with this vehicle for a while now or I have to eat that
  cost.


  I had just gotten this new truck about 4 months prior then had to deal with this
  nearly every day for the 7 weeks it took to get repaired. It was a nightmare and
  very stressful dealing with this.


  I ended up suing her in small claims court and won by default because she did not
  show up. I feel like she wasn''t planning on repaying me until she was trying to
  get her license reinstated and fortunately the state is requiring her to have a
  repayment plan with me before she can get her license back. She has agreed to repay
  me $100 every other week until paid in full. So far, I have received 1 such payment
  with the next due today.


  Now the part where I sort of feel like an asshole is that my wife and I make about
  $225,000 per year combined and after this lady sent me her statement of assets through
  the court, she has about $200 to her name and makes $400 per week as a waitress.
  I paid the $3,800 and sort of moved on financially. It is a lot of money, but we
  can afford it.


  She very obviously owes me the money, but the $100 every other week very clearly
  would mean a lot more to her financially than me. What say you?'
