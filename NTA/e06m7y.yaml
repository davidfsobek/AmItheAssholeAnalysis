selftext: "I\u2019m a 29 year old guy who finished residency two ago and am now a\
  \ pediatrician making >160k.\n\nI got tired of being single for most of my life\
  \ so I downloaded a few dating apps and met this girl (26) who works in customer\
  \ service for a huge company about 9 months ago. We hit it off and officially became\
  \ exclusive three months ago.\n\nOverall she\u2019s a really great person. But there\u2019\
  s a few things about her that bother me, and I\u2019m not really sure if it\u2019\
  s normal or not because I\u2019ve never really been in an actual serious relationship.\n\
  \n-I always pay for everything on dates. I know that I make more than her and it\
  \ doesn\u2019t necessarily hurt me to always pay, but she doesn\u2019t ever offer\
  \ to pay or split the bill and she just expects me to always pay.\n\n-The first\
  \ time she came over to my apartment she was literally shocked. I live in a shitty\
  \ one bedroom apartment because I want to pay off my student loans as fast as possible\
  \ so I still basically live like a broke college student. She kept making comments\
  \ about how I should move out and find a nicer place that suits a doctor.\n\n-She\
  \ wanted to introduce me to her family right away. I thought the relationship is\
  \ too new to meet the parents but she insisted. And when we went to their house,\
  \ her parents only asked about my job and salary.\n\n-When we went out and ran into\
  \ someone she knows she introduced me as her doctor boyfriend.\n\nThese things,\
  \ plus some other stuff made me realize she doesn\u2019t really care about me, just\
  \ that I\u2019m a doctor. So I told her. She blew up, saying I\u2019m insulting\
  \ her and calling her a gold digger, and that she\u2019s just proud of me for being\
  \ successful.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit:\n1)  I wanted to clear something up, my apartment\
  \ is NOT dirty. When I said I live in a shitty one bedroom apartment I just meant\
  \ that it\u2019s really small. Poor wording on my part. \n\n2) I agree with a lot\
  \ of you that I let my frustrations build up and then I just accused her instead\
  \ of trying to talk to her. This is my first \u2018real\u2019 relationship so I\
  \ have a lot to learn. \n\n3) It\u2019s true that she doesn\u2019t ask me for money\
  \ or for expensive gifts. I\u2019m starting to think I was too quick to assume anything.\n\
  \n4) I did a dual enrollment program in high school that allowed me to graduate\
  \ from college two years early. So that\u2019s why I\u2019m an independent doctor\
  \ at my age. I\u2019m also turning 30 in a few weeks.\n\n5) Thank you to everyone\
  \ for your thoughts! I totally wasn\u2019t expecting this post to receive so many\
  \ comments."
