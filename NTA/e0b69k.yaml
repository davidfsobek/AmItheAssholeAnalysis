selftext: "Mom and pops were married for 30ish years. I\u2019m 26. Always thought\
  \ they were a dream couple until 5 years ago when I found out that my dad had fathered\
  \ a child from an affair that he had in 2006. \n\nMy mom went batshit crazy when\
  \ she found out, I honestly believe her mental health cracked and deteriorated from\
  \ then and she divorced my dad and moved to the other side of the US. Essentially,\
  \ I lost my mom to my dads idiocy, she is *not* the same woman as she used to be.\
  \ \n\nMy dad had always been in this girls life, but over the past 5 years I guess\
  \ because he had no one to keep it a secret from he\u2019s more or less a full time\
  \ dad to her. \n\nSince the divorce I\u2019ve kept my distance from him, I\u2019\
  m just trying to secure my bag , live quietly and stay away from drama. \n\nHe has\
  \ lately started up this crusade of me meeting this girl and developing a brotherly\
  \ bond with her. I told him It\u2019s just not on the cards, I have no interest\
  \ in picking up a relationship with anybody and I have my own hatred for my fathers\
  \ new family and idc what anyone says, therapy ain\u2019t fixing that. Believe me,\
  \ I\u2019ve tried. It\u2019s better for my mental health if I continue to do my\
  \ thing and not involve myself. \n\nIt\u2019s got to a point where everyone on my\
  \ paternal side is bugging me for some sort of Christmas miracle meet up, apparently\
  \ this girl wants to know me very much and is begging that she gets to meet me as\
  \ a Christmas present. I\u2019ve consistently told everybody \u2018no\u2019 and\
  \ I\u2019m also not celebrating Christmas with them in case they try force anything.\
  \ \n\nThe only person on my side in all this is my fianc\xE9e, who is the only one\
  \ who gives a shit about what hurt this might cause me instead of anything else.\
  \ Just wondering if IATA for shutting everybody down over this."
