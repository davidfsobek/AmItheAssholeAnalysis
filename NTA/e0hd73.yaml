selftext: "I got engaged to my wife when we were 26, we had been dating for 7 years.\n\
  \nI got her engagement ring engraved to say \u201CSemper amemus\u201D which means\
  \ let us always love, I spent all my savings on her engagement ring and even took\
  \ a loan out to buy it, it seems silly now but I love her and she deserves the best.\n\
  \n\nWe got married at 30, adopted our first child at 32, second child at 35 and\
  \ now we\u2019re both 40.\n\nI recently found out she pawned her engagement ring\
  \ for \xA31,200, I spent over nine thousand on her ring.\n\n\nShe\u2019s telling\
  \ me she\u2019s got a bunch of pictures of it and she isn\u2019t a jewellery person\
  \ anyway which is true in all the years I\u2019ve known her she\u2019s only worn\
  \ her crucifix and engagement/wedding ring, the wedding ring means everything to\
  \ her but she doesn\u2019t have any attachment to the engagement ring.\n\nI\u2019\
  m completely upset about that \n\nShe thinks I\u2019m an AH because it was *her*\
  \ ring after all and it didn\u2019t mean as much to her as it did to me \n\nAITA?"
