selftext: "My wife has minor anxiety and ocd. She has been on meds for a long time,\
  \ but had to go off them when she got pregnant. None of the pregnancy safe meds\
  \ worked for her. Pregnancy was really tough for her, she spent a lot of time reading\
  \ about what foods and activities and such could harm a fetus, and she was basically\
  \ paralyzed by fear that she was hurting our son whenever she did anything. It was\
  \ really rough for her and she hated being pregnant. She had a mental breakdown\
  \ and confessed to me that she didn\u2019t want to breastfeed, she was feeling violated\
  \ by the pregnancy and wanted her body back and to go back on her meds, but she\
  \ was worried that our son would be terribly harmed if she didn\u2019t. I talked\
  \ her out of breastfeeding because the pros were far outweighed by the cons and\
  \ she clearly didn\u2019t want to do it.\n\nAfter the delivery, I was using the\
  \ bathroom and my father was in the room with my wife. A lactation consultant came\
  \ in and asked my wife if she was ready to breastfeed. My wife said she wasn\u2019\
  t going to breastfeed and the lactation consultant started pushing and reminding\
  \ her of the benefits of breastfeeding (which to my wife, was reminding her of all\
  \ the ways she was harming our son by not breastfeeding.) my father also started\
  \ pressuring her. She said she just kept saying \u201CI don\u2019t want to,\u201D\
  \ but was very close to capitulating because she was so tired and anxious and she\
  \ just wanted it to end. I came back into the room and kicked out the lactation\
  \ consultant and my dad for not listening to her when she said no.\n\nThings got\
  \ considerably better when we left the hospital. My wife was able to get back on\
  \ her meds and was happy. This was the first part of the pregnancy/birth process\
  \ that she actually got to enjoy. Her meds can take up to a month or two to have\
  \ full effect, so the anxiety and ocd issues are still there, but much less.\n\n\
  The conflict comes in because I told my dad he couldn\u2019t be around my wife and\
  \ son for the time being because he participated in pressuring her when she said\
  \ no. I\u2019ve also run into an issue when sending pictures of the baby to family.\
  \ A number of people wrote back nitpicking how my wife my holding the baby, what\
  \ she was feeding him, the crib we\u2019re using and so on. I stopped sending photos,\
  \ but my wife and I talked and she said she was still feeling fixated on everything\
  \ she was doing wrong as a mom, and these critiques would make it worse.\n\nSo I\
  \ told everyone who critiqued our parenting that they can\u2019t come meet the baby.\
  \ They probably can in a month or so when my wife will be more secure mentally and\
  \ as a mom, but until then, no one can come. Thus far, the only people who have\
  \ met my son are my wife\u2019s parents, her sister, and my mom.\n\nA lot of my\
  \ family is saying that this is unfair because they have good intentions and are\
  \ just trying to help. My mom told me I should give them a chance, but I think the\
  \ risk is too big. Am I the asshole for banning them?"
