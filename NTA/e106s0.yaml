selftext: "My partner and I bought a house this summer, and for Thanksgiving we\u2019\
  re hosting my parents-in-law, my sister-in-law (SIL), and her husband. SIL is due\
  \ with her first baby at the end of February.\n\nThe plan is to have parents (in\
  \ their late 60\u2019s) sleep in our guest bedroom on a proper frame and mattress.\
  \ That leaves our office, with an air mattress (a decent one, but still) for SIL\
  \ and her husband. \n\nLast time SIL visited overnight a few months ago, we had\
  \ other guests already staying in the guest bedroom for several weeks and felt it\
  \ would be a lot to have them move all their personal items, so we gave her the\
  \ air mattress again.  She made a big deal about how pregnant people should get\
  \ priority sleeping arrangements, even if it means uprooting someone for a night.\
  \ She recently mentioned to my partner that maybe she and her husband should take\
  \ our master bedroom when they come in a few days for the holiday.\n\nI\u2019ve\
  \ never been pregnant, and I can respect that maybe you just want some damn comfort\
  \ as you grow a human. However, I think my judgment may be clouded by my annoyance\
  \ that she historically makes a stink about getting what she wants, pregnant or\
  \ not. Further, I currently live long-distance from my partner, and I am only home\
  \ for the week. I just want to enjoy the visit, appreciate the home we\u2019ve bought\
  \ AND sleep in my master bedroom, dammit. AITA?\n\nEDIT: Thanks for all of your\
  \ suggestions and reality checks. I really liked the suggestion from /u/lizard_windowpane\
  \ to leave it to the in-laws in a group chat to determine who sleeps where. Realistically,\
  \ it feels a bit late in the game to insinuate via text that SIL would be better\
  \ off not showing up, so my partner and I have decided to put our nice comfy mattress\
  \ into the office for SIL and rock out on the air mattress in our room for the visit.\
  \ Is it a perfect solution? No, but SIL and elder in-laws get much-needed comfort,\
  \ we keep our room. Hopefully next year, we\u2019ll just be guests!"
