selftext: "My brother is 45 years old and he and his wife have an almost 2 year old.\
  \ They are only going to have one child because of their age, but also because my\
  \ SIL had a ton of anxiety around being pregnant, how she was going to lose her\
  \ baby weight etc.\n\nThe issue now is that my bro and SIL seem to be really overprotective\
  \ of their daughter. She bumps her head really lightly and they are all over the\
  \ baby: \u2018Are you okay???\u2019 ...multiple times.  Like I\u2019m talking not\
  \ a hard bump at all, just a bit against the wall when picking up a toy. Kid doesn\u2019\
  t even notice.  Also, they don\u2019t enforce any discipline at all for anything.\
  \  When they visit my parents for dinner, she takes handfuls of food and throws\
  \ it on the ground. The parents don\u2019t say anything and keep eating. I know\
  \ that kids play with their food, but aren\u2019t you supposed to teach your kids\
  \ manners when at other people\u2019s houses? \n\nThe last straw was yesterday at\
  \ my parents place. My dad was playing with her and holding her hands when she stepped\
  \ on to a step and jumped off. Both my brother and SIL started screaming at him\
  \ that he should be holding her by the chest when she jumps off, not by the hands.\
  \ God forbid, she falls and twists her arms if she lands in an awkward position.\
  \ This step was about 8 inches high.\n\nI took my brother aside and said wtf. Don\u2019\
  t talk to our dad that way, this isn\u2019t his first rodeo raising kids (there\
  \ are 4 of us kids and multiple other grand children). Then I said that children\
  \ are very resilient and that she wasn\u2019t in any danger of twisting her arms\
  \ at all. He got mad and said she\u2019s not my kid and he\u2019s raising her how\
  \ they want to. I then called him a helicopter parent in the making and that he\u2019\
  s going to create a child that is anxious and dependent if they are always concerned\
  \ about protecting their daughter from every little thing. He\u2019s now mad at\
  \ me and refuses to talk to me. AITA?"
