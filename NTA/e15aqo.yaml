selftext: So my best friend and I went clubbing and she kissed a guy who wasnt her
  boyfriend. She asked me to keep it a secret and kept in touch with the guy after.
  Her and her boyfriend have been on the rocks lately. I was gonna sign a lease with
  her and her boyfriend. She doesn't have a job so it would be me and her boyfriend
  on the lease paying everything. When I asked what would happen if they broke up
  she said she'd just kick him out but he would be on the lease paying half the rent
  and I wouldn't be able to pay the rent by myself. I am also pretty good friends
  with her boyfriend. I was friends with him before I was friends with her i've seen
  him go through a lot of shit and get hurt pretty badly. At first I meant to keep
  the kiss to myself cause shes my best friend but then I started drinking with her
  boyfriend and I ended up telling him. After she found out she went off on me and
  blocked me on everything. Half our friends say I did the right thing the other half
  say i'm a hate ful bitch or a snitch. So reddit am I the asshole?
