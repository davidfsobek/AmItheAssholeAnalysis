selftext: "My 16 year old son was catfishing people on the internet for petty cash\
  \ (10-50 dollars per person.) \n\nI couldn\u2019t believe it. I don\u2019t know\
  \ how I screwed up as a parent this badly to fail to instill in him that this is\
  \ wrong and morally depraved behavior. \n\nI asked why he\u2019d do this to innocent\
  \ people, mostly elderly people, and he said he needed money to buy things we wouldn\u2019\
  t buy him (video gaming equipment, expensive sneakers, etc.) \n\nI told him when\
  \ he asked for those things to go get a job, but he said it would take too long\
  \ to save up for those things with a job and this was faster. \n\nHis excuse was\
  \ if they\u2019re stupid enough to fall for his scam, they deserve to have their\
  \ money taken. But he swore he wouldn\u2019t do it again. \n\nI didn\u2019t believe\
  \ him. I couldn\u2019t risk that. I felt I needed him to have a wake up call now\
  \ when there\u2019s still a chance he\u2019ll turn this behavior and life outlook\
  \ around. \n\nI collected all the evidence of what he\u2019d done and reported him\
  \ to the police. \n\nAfter I did this, I was devastated, and called a friend to\
  \ vent and ask where I\u2019d gone wrong in raising him. \n\nShe was horrified.\
  \ Not at his behavior but at what I\u2019d done. She said there was no reason I\
  \ couldn\u2019t have settled the problem within the home and didn\u2019t have to\
  \ open my son up to the risks of the legal system. \n\nNow I\u2019m even more broken\
  \ up. And I don\u2019t want to put our business out there by running the situation\
  \ by many other people. \n\nWas I the asshole?"
