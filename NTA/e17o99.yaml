  \ has this skillet that needed attention. It STUNK, I mean, I took out the trash,\
  \ and cleaned the rest of the kitchen and finally determined the smell was coming\
  \ from the pan. She literally only rinses or wipes it out after every use. I got\
  \ some hot water and salt, made a paste, and spend probably an hour in that thing\
  \ total. The bottom was rusted so I oiled it and let it cure in a hot oven. She\u2019\
  s mad because I ruined its seasoning right before thanksgiving, I think I just saved\
  \ myself from food poisoning. AITA?\n\nTl;dr; washed and cured aunties stinky old\
  \ cast iron pan before thanksgiving"
