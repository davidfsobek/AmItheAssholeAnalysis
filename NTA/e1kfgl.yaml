selftext: 'My friend is studying for a masters in clinical psychology at a really
  good university.


  A group of us were hanging out in a social context. We all step outside at one point
  to get some air, and she starts talking about her degree program.


  One of our friends jokingly asks her to diagnose him since she''s studying psychology.
  She responds, "Well what have you been diagnosed with?" This leads to a slightly
  bizarre conversation about what we''ve all been diagnosed with. I didn''t want to
  partake in the conversation, but eventually the question was turned on me.


  I state, "PMDD," \[premenstrual dysphoric disorder\] because it''s true and I thought
  better just to answer it, and then we can get back inside.


  My friend (the one studying for the masters) unexpectedly responds, "That''s not
  real. It''s a creation of our patriarchal society to pathologize being a woman."
  \[I''m paraphrasing, but that was basically the gist of it\].


  I respond that she''s 100% wrong about that, and it''s actually not even categorized
  as a psychiatric problem anymore but an endocrine one because they''ve been able
  to isolate the problem with hormone receptors that causes the disorder (in other
  words, it''s totally biological).


  She says that one of her professors agrees with her about it. I tell her that her
  professor is totally wrong, and I can send her a bunch of research if she''d like.


  We drop it there, and we all go back inside. The next day my friend''s roommate
  (who I''m also close to) calls me and says that our friend is really upset that
  I "questioned her credentials," and undermine her in front of people by saying that
  she was wrong on this point, because I do not have any medical qualifications (I
  just know a lot about this particular disorder by virtue of living with it for over
  a decade).


  I thought I was totally within my right to correct her since she was the one spreading
  the misinformation in the first place. But was I the asshole in this situation?'

  program?
