selftext: "I am getting married to a beautiful Indian girl from Malaysia. Much of\
  \ her family cannot travel to the US for our wedding, so we are doing a formal engagement\
  \ ceremony in her hometown. Her family is very welcoming and offered to get me and\
  \ my immediate family traditional Indian clothing to wear for the ceremony.\n\n\
  I thought it sounded like a great idea and I felt honored that they wanted us to\
  \ feel included in their culture. When I brought it up to my parents though, my\
  \ mom was pretty uncomfortable it. She is worried that we will end up on the wrong\
  \ end of a social media crusade for \"cultural appropriation.\" \n\nI feel like\
  \ people of any culture should be allowed to share their traditions with whoever\
  \ they want, but I'm also pretty sure I saw a pic go viral for this exact reason\
  \ a few years back. I want to participate, but I also don't want drama or random\
  \ internet people telling my family to kill themselves.\n\nSo, would I/we be the\
  \ assholes for wearing traditional Indian clothing when we are painfully, obviously\
  \ Scandinavian? If not, are we still going to get accosted?\n\nEdit:\nI can't believe\
  \ how much attention this got. Thank you all. I don't think my parents were ever\
  \ really concerned about it being legitimately offensive, more so just worried about\
  \ it being taken the wrong way. That said, a huge majority of comments have been\
  \ immensely supportive. I will definitely be participating, and I told my family\
  \ that they are 100% welcome. If anyone has a problem with it, they're probably\
  \ just an asshole."
