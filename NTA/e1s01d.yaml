selftext: 'I''m a 32F and have had my dog (Oscar) for 10 years. I rescued him from
  a dog fighting ring and we have had quite the journey together since. I do not have
  children, but he is like a son to me. I got married a month ago and the approaching
  holidays are significant for my partner and I to celebrate with our newly formed
  families.

  Unfortunately, the week we got back from our honeymoon we found out Oscar (now almost
  11) has lymphoma. Naturally, I am devastated but I have pet insurance that is covering
  his chemo treatments and he is responding well! This year, my parents are hosting
  Thanksgiving and have had an unnecessarily strict "no dog" policy in their house.


  Background: My parents used to have a dog that not only lived in the house, but
  also underwent chemo.

  I have always respected their house rules (although I think they are absurd and
  my dog is extremely well behaved) and have had a sitter watch Oscar when I visit
  them. They told me weeks ago that I am able to finally bring Oscar with me to their
  home for Thanksgiving, as they know with his health I am not comfortable having
  a sitter watch him. Since he''s been on chemo, he has basically been my shadow.
  He follows me everywhere for comfort and obviously I am more than happy to provide
  that.

  Today, I was told that when he is there he will have to be kept in the basement.
  I threw a FIT. I know my mother and my stepfather are neat freaks so I prepaid for
  a grooming appointment that includes nail clipping (for their hardwood floors) and
  a deshedding treatment on top of a conditioning treatment. I am going above and
  beyond to accommodate their expectations and am now being told 2 days before I arrive
  he will be kept in the basement. With his fragile state, I told them I am not comfortable
  with this whatsoever and I was looking forward to our first holiday as a newlywed
  couple with our side of the family but with this newly developed demand, I simply
  will not be attending. They do have a cat but my dog was raised with a cat and has
  no problems being around one.

  AITA here?

  Edit:


  It is *not* a finished basement, it is concrete and very cold.

  I''m getting a few comments calling me TA for treating my dog with chemo. It was
  a very difficult decision to make and I just ask you show a little respect, I''m
  not asking for an opinion for how I treat my dog medically.

  Oscar was not a dog fighter, he was a reject because of his sweet temperament.

  Here is Oscar! [https://imgur.com/gallery/yHiavlk](https://imgur.com/gallery/yHiavlk)


  Thank you everyone for your input and overwhelming kindness and empathy!'
