selftext: 'My high school changed the frequency of the swimming classes from once
  in two weeks, to once a week. Hence, they combined guys and girls into the same
  swimming class, instead of having separate swimming classes for boys and girls.
  Because of this, they''ve changed the dress code for girls. Now girls can wear a
  wetsuit, a fully covered swimsuit or a one-piece swimsuit that doesn''t "expose
  yourself too much". Girls can no longer wear bikinis or other swimsuits that show
  the midriff or the stomach. Also if girls want to wear one piece swimsuits, the
  strap shouldn''t be too thin, and they would encourage girls to wear swimsuits with
  sleeves, but it''s not mandatory.


  On the other hand, there is no change to the boys swimsuits. They can wear body
  suits or swim trunks or board shorts. I find this new rule so unbelievably sexist
  and irritating. It also implies that guys are perverts who can''t control themselves,
  and who will be so distracted by looking at a girl that they can''t swim properly.
  However, my friends are discouraging me from complaining, because they are afraid
  that we will then go back to separate lessons for boys and girls, and this would
  reduce the frequency of swim classes which everyone loves. Also everyone is very
  excited about combined swimming classes for guys and girls and I don''t want to
  do anything to ruin that, I don''t know what the consequences will be if I complain.
  AITA?'
