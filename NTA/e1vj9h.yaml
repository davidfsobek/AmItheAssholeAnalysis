selftext: "My girlfriend and I are both 19. She has never been taught how to drive\
  \ and wanted to learn from me. She followed my instructions on the first lesson.\
  \ Two days ago however on the second lesson, she was stubborn about braking with\
  \ her left foot even after I warned her about the safety reasons why almost everyone\
  \ uses their right foot on both the gas and the brake pedals. \n\n\nShe said that\
  \ since she\u2019s a volleyball player, she doesn\u2019t want to develop a muscle\
  \ imbalance in her calves. I told her that she could just switch from her right\
  \ foot to her left foot when braking at a red light and gently press down and lift\
  \ up her left foot repeatedly to train her left calf a bit. She said that isn\u2019\
  t enough and she would be able to learn how to left foot brake effectively and safely\
  \ if she practices it from the start. \n\n\nI kind of see her point, but I told\
  \ her it\u2019s still a needless safety hazard and I don\u2019t want to be responsible\
  \ if she gets into an accident driving this way by condoning this method. I threatened\
  \ to quit teaching her how to drive if she doesn\u2019t use her right foot exclusively\
  \ like most drivers. She was so stubborn and said she\u2019ll ask one of her friends\
  \ to teach her instead. Apparently, one of her male friends will start teaching\
  \ her tomorrow. \n\n\nI talked to some of my friends about this and most of them\
  \ don\u2019t see it as a big issue for her to brake with her left foot. Most also\
  \ think I\u2019m making a big mistake by letting another guy teach her how to drive."
title: AITA for stop teaching my girlfriend how to drive because she is stubborn about
  braking with her left foot?
