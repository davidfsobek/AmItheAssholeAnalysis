  \ door. From my patio door it's 30 second walk to the gym. I bring baby monitor\
  \ and it still works that distance. \n\nI go to the gym for hour a night and have\
  \ my daughter (9mo old) three day a week. I only go to the gym when she's asleep.\
  \ I've only been doing this for month and not once have she woken up while I was\
  \ gone.\n\nAITA? FWIW I grew up in Switzerland before moving to Canada and leaving\
  \ children unattended at home is somewhat common, not quite a social faux-pas as\
  \ it is here. My ex-wife thinks this is the worst thing I can do to the child which\
  \ I'm don't agree with.\n\nSorry for my poor English."
