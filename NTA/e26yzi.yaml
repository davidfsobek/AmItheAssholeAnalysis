selftext: "Two years ago my late wife died in a tragic car accident. She was going\
  \ to work in a snowstorm when her car was hit by an out of control semi-truck. She\
  \ was killed instantly. \n\nOf course when I got the call, I was devestated. We\
  \ had been married for just two years. Now I was only 27 and widowed. It took months\
  \ of healing and regaining my faith in God and in this world to move. In part of\
  \ that healing, I posted a tribute of her to my Instagram (at the time of her passing)\
  \ saying all these things I wanted her to be remembered for. I ended it with \"\
  I will always love you, *name*, rest in peace my love.\"\n\nA few months ago I met\
  \ a new girl at work. We hit off really well and things picked up fast. She was\
  \ a bit controlling, but I kind of liked it, that someone was really protective\
  \ of me. It wasn't overbearing controlling, but just enough to make me feel cherished.\
  \ A few days ago though, (and my now GF knows of my deceased wife), said she saw\
  \ my tribute post to her and asked if I could take it down. \n\nI was really confused\
  \ and asked why; she said \"it has love, that is the present tense, do you still\
  \ love her?\" and \"its been three years, you need to move on.\" \n\nI told her\
  \ \"I loved my late wife, and I have moved on, that why I felt ready to date you.\"\
  \ She then said \"if thats true, you should have no problem deleting the post.\"\
  \ I dont want to delete the post though. She was still my wife, she died tragically,\
  \ she deserves to be remembered for more than just being a wife, she was  great\
  \ person - and a nurse, too. \n\nAITA if I don't delete the post? What should I\
  \ say to my GF?"
