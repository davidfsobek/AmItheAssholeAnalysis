selftext: "This happened this past Saturday. So, I (24M), have been with my SO (22F)\
  \ who we'll call Cat for about a little over a month now. I've met her roommates\
  \ but I have yet to meet her entire friend group which stems from a dance team she's\
  \ on. She was really wanting me to meet them and I was wanting her to meet my 3\
  \ best friends from childhood who we'll call Tom, John, and Zack. My best friends\
  \ and I already planned to go out drinking last Saturday night and so did my SO\
  \ and her friends, so I told my SO my friends and I would meet up with her and I\
  \ can meet her friends and she can meet mine. All goes well in the planning phase.\n\
  \nCome Saturday night, I show up to the bar with my 3 best friends and my SO starts\
  \ introducing my friends and I. Everything went well and I met most in that moment\
  \ except these 3 girls who were just acting very boujee and standoffish but I didn't\
  \ think much of it. The bar was right next to us so I told Cat I was going to get\
  \ a drink. I was standing by the bar with my friends and I ordered a $5 pitcher\
  \ which is a large vodka drink in a bud light pitcher. This drink is typically shared\
  \ because of it's size. As I'm standing by the bar waiting for my friends to order\
  \ their drinks I hear someone yell: \n\n> Hey! Cat's boyfriend!\n\nI turn around\
  \ and it's the 3 girls who I did not meet. I said hey and reached out for a handshake\
  \ and without saying a word to me, they held out their cups instead and pointed\
  \ at my pitcher. I was honestly in disbelief for a second, as was my SO who I could\
  \ see in the corner of my eye, and my 3 best friends. \n\nWhatever the case, I did\
  \ what any gentleman would do...I grabbed their 3 cups, filled them up to the brim\
  \ with my drink, and then handed one cup to Tom, the other to John, and the last\
  \ one to Zack. I looked back at the girls, promptly thanked them for providing cups\
  \ for my friends, kissed my SO on the forehead, and left them alone and hung out\
  \ with my boys the rest of the night.\n\nMy SO is saying that it *was* fucked up\
  \ what they did but that I should have just given them the drinks since it was the\
  \ first time meeting them and she woulda paid the $5 back to me. I explained it\
  \ wasn't money but principle and how they felt entitled to a drink and didn't even\
  \ bother to shake my hand or refer to me by my name but instead as your boyfriend.\
  \ She also thinks I'm TA for leaving her for the rest of the night. I can *maybe*\
  \ agree with that but after that incident, I wasn't in the mood to be around that,\
  \ so I chose not to.\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: RIP my inbox. Thanks ya'll for the responses.\
  \ It seems by majority people think I'm NTA but I think I'm gonna personally stick\
  \ with ESH for ignoring my SO for the rest of the night and just the general immaturity\
  \ of my actions. Just to clarify, I did not leave her *alone alone*. I left her\
  \ with her large group of friends and she was 100% safe. \n\nFor those asking about\
  \ the drink. It's one of [these pitchers](https://www.beerneonsforsale.com/product/bud-light-beer-pitcher/)\
  \ with sprite, UV Blue, dash of Everclear, something else to make it sweeter, and\
  \ a bunch of ice to make up the rest of the space. It's delicious. I'm not going\
  \ to say where but it's in the deep South in a small college town. \n\nThat entire\
  \ situation has blown over in my personal life at this point and I haven't bothered\
  \ to ask what her friends thought about me doing that. Just so we're clear, it was\
  \ only those 3 that were rude, the rest were extremely nice which is why I feel\
  \ like TA for ignoring them after. \n\nThanks again and Happy Thanksgiving to everyone\
  \ who celebrates. Hope you can spend it with family, friends, and good food!"
