selftext: "I'm a 25 year old guy and my parents were in the process of divorcing when\
  \ my mother got diagnosed with a terminal illness. After the diagnosis, my father\
  \ stalled the divorce proceedings. \n\n\n\nMy father filed for divorce after 26\
  \ years of marriage after he fell in love with his younger business partner. She\
  \ recently gave birth to his child. \n\nMy mother was a stay at home mom for 25\
  \ years who took care of the entire household while my father worked long hours.\
  \ \n\nShe was blindsided when my father told her about wanting a divorce. He told\
  \ her that he would always love her as his best friend and as the mother of his\
  \ 5 children, but he was also in love with this other woman. \n\nMy mother was devastated\
  \ and stopped eating properly.\n\n\n In the middle of the divorce, she was diagnosed\
  \ with terminal illness and was only given a few months to live. \n\nAll this time,\
  \ we, her children have looked after her. I took her to her appointments and we\
  \ paid for the treatment by taking loans. We didn't ask our father for money, even\
  \ though he was willing to cover the expenses. Legally, at the time of her death\
  \ she was still married to my father. \n\nDuring her last days, my father had to\
  \ move to another city to be there for his daughter's birth. My uncle made a facebook\
  \ post asking for blood donation (she has a rare blood type) and stated that she\
  \ was critical. When my dad got to know about it, he immediately flew down to our\
  \ city. \n\nWhen he showed up to the hospital, he was in a bad shape. His clothes\
  \ were unkempt. He wanted to see my mother one last time. I told him that there\
  \ was no use of that as she was unconscious. He begged and cried in front of everyone,\
  \ I still didn't allow him to meet her. (The hospital authorities let her family\
  \ decide who was allowed to visit her) \n\nMy mother passed away the next morning.\
  \ He still didn't leave and wanted to be there for the funeral and memorial service.\
  \ We banned him from attending.\n\nI believe that he lost the right to see her in\
  \ her pain when he was the one who caused her immeasurable pain. My buddy tells\
  \ me that me and (my mother's family) are the assholes for not letting him see her\
  \ one last time.\n \n---------\n\nEdit : I want to make some facts clear -\n\n1)\
  \ When my father told my mother that he was in love with his business partner and\
  \ wanted a divorce, the other woman was already pregnant with his child. \n\n\n\
  2) I was/am her legal representative (edit : Power of Attorney, to make things clear\
  \ ). I had the legal right to deny visitors. My mother's entire family supported\
  \ me in my decision to not let him see her. My grandma wanted the same. My siblings\
  \ wanted the same.\n\n-------------\n\nEdit 2 :\n\n\n3) During her last days, when\
  \ she was in the hospice, she got to a stage where she could no longer communicate\
  \ verbally. And she never expressed anything about wanting our father there. \n\n\
  In fact, she didn't mention him at all. \n\n4) I realize that this means the end\
  \ of my relationship with our father. I have accepted that and I have no interest\
  \ in pursuing a future relationship with him, his new woman or his child. My siblings\
  \ are on the same page.\n\nWe have accepted the fact that we have lost two parents\
  \ forever.\n\nI plan to be there for my younger siblings as their pillar of support."
