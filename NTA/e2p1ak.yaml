selftext: "My great grandmother passed away a few days ago and her funeral with this\
  \ morning. High Roman Catholic Mass. She was 103. One of my cousins,\" Joseph\"\
  , brought his girlfriend \"Raven\". They're both 19 and if my Aunt Sandy is to be\
  \ believed neither of them work but live in her basement playing video games and\
  \ smoking pot. Joseph was a pallbearer so he wore a suit. Raven, however, showed\
  \ up wearing a pair of knee length denim shorts and an orange and white flannel\
  \ button up. Strangely enough she didn't seem to notice or mind that everyone else\
  \ was wearing dark clothing, funeral clothing. A lot of people were giving her looks,\
  \ and making comments. My great grandmother's children were especially offended.\n\
  \nAfter the service we went back to great grandma's house for the reception. I'm\
  \ in my mid-twenties and the oldest of the younger generation of cousins so we all\
  \ sort of made a place on the back porch. Raven and I found ourselves alone at one\
  \ point so I very gently told her that her outfit was inappropriate for a Catholic\
  \ funeral, or a funeral of any kind. Raven got upset and demanded to know if she\
  \ was supposed to go out and buy new clothes for one event. I told her no, a dark\
  \ pair of pants and a dark shirt would have been fine, but wearing shorts and a\
  \ bright shirt are not appropriate for anyone's funeral and I couldn't believe that\
  \ A). She didn't know this, and B). Joseph didn't try to get her to wear something\
  \ else. My verbatim words were, \"hey, can I just tell you something? I'm not trying\
  \ to make you upset, or tell you off, but your outfit isn't really appropriate for\
  \ a funeral. Especially one like great grandma's, where it's very religious. In\
  \ the future, you can just wear dark clothing, keep it simple, conservative.\"\n\
  \nShe and Joseph left shortly after and later on I got a text fro him letting me\
  \ know that Raven was highly offended and he wanted me to apologize. I can see how\
  \ someone might be embarrassed to have been given a \"ticking off\" about their\
  \ clothes but I wasn't rude or unnecessarily mean about it. I don't see why I owe\
  \ anyone an apology. I didn't ask her to leave, I didn't call her names or yell\
  \ at her. And we were alone. So no one else was listening. \n\nWas I an asshole?"
