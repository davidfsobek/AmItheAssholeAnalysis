selftext: "backstory: i worked at a small, locally and family owned business. i worked\
  \ there for 2 years, was one of 6 employees, 3 of which were the owners' daughters.\
  \ up until yesterday, i was on very good terms with the family.\n\n\nsince its the\
  \ holidays, i was the only employee that wasn't going to be out of town. they had\
  \ a family reunion on the other side of the country, and the mother was going to\
  \ fly there on Wednesday, leaving me to work a solo shift that day. the mother,\
  \ my manager, promised me she'd pay me time-and-a-half because she appreciated that\
  \ i was going to work there all day.\n\n\ni was working the closing shift a few\
  \ nights ago, so i was the only one there. i normally do a fine job at closing.\
  \ except this time i accidentally left the keys in the front door when i locked\
  \ up. it definitely could've been very bad if someone had broken in, and i hadn't\
  \ made any mistakes like this up until then. i was woken up early yesterday morning\
  \ by my furious manager, who told me to come in right away to have a talk.\_\n\n\
  \ni was near crying when i went in because i felt so bad, i apologized profusely\
  \ over and over. but my manager cut me off, and told me \"i need you to work your\
  \ shifts today and tomorrow. but after that, i want you out of here. you're fired\"\
  . i was shocked, to say the least, when she told me this. and on top of that, she\
  \ took back her offer of paying me time-and-a-half for working Wednesday.\_\n\n\n\
  i thought, how dare she be so callous over this! i totally understood that this\
  \ was a horrible mistake, but to just fire me with no warning, after I've been such\
  \ a loyal employee to her, is completely ridiculous.\n\n\ni felt completely screwed\
  \ over, and so i told her \"since you're fucking me over, I'll fuck you over too.\
  \ I'm quitting\". and i walked out with her screaming at me. if she's going to take\
  \ my job away like this, I'm going to fuck up her Thanksgiving vacation. she called\
  \ me a couple of times, one of which she was crying and trying to offer me my job\
  \ back. i told her to go fuck herself. after all I've done for them, and for her\
  \ to just fire me out of the blue, I'm not going back. and I'm pretty sure she saw\
  \ this is a reason to fire me so she could save money on payroll, since business\
  \ has been slow. so now I'm out of a job, and she doesn't get to go to her family\
  \ reunion because she'll be working.\n\n\ni told this to my older sister, thinking\
  \ she'd be happy for me for sticking up for myself. but she told me I'm an asshole\
  \ over this. in retrospect, i do feel a bit bad.\_ but i don't entirely regret what\
  \ i did.\n\n\nso reddit, AITA in this situation?\n\n\ntl:dr; after being a loyal\
  \ employee for two years at my job and making one bad mistake, my manager decided\
  \ to ask me to work my last two days, and then she'd fire me. i would have worked\
  \ all day on Wednesday because she was flying across the country for a family reunion,\
  \ and i was the only employee available. so i told her i was quitting. she fucked\
  \ me out of my job, so i fucked her out of her family reunion.\n\nedit: thank you\
  \ so much for all of you who replied! i honestly didn't think this many people would\
  \ care about my situation, so thank you all! sorry i haven't been replying, I've\
  \ been spending Thanksgiving with my fam, trying to get my mind off of what happened\
  \ a few days ago. I'm going to start looking for new jobs tomorrow, I've been working\
  \ on my resume in the meantime. anyways, hope you've all had a great holiday, and\
  \ thanks again!\n\noh and for those wondering, i have not heard anything from manager\
  \ or from the rest of the family, and likely won't."
