selftext: 'Two months ago my wife was looking at Christmas photographers. We''ve done
  them every year we''ve known each other, it''s a tradition at this point. We''ve
  never had our dogs in the photos but this year I asked her to find a photographer
  who will take dogs because my dog was ill and vets say she''ll likely pass within
  the next couple of weeks.


  Photo day was last Friday. My wife told me on Thursday that there would, in fact,
  be no dogs allowed. She decided to use the same photographer we''ve always used
  who doesn''t allow dogs at their studio. Too late to cancel, my wife knew this and
  left it to the last minute before telling me. I paid for a dog haircut and a nice
  dog sweater, too.


  So I fucked up the photos. I didn''t smile, I just had a thousand yard stare. Even
  the photographers were upset I didn''t cooperate. We got zero good photos.


  My dog passed two days ago, at home, peacefully. We have no photos of us as a family
  together. I am exceedingly upset, half because my dog is now gone but also the malicious
  lie my wife told me. Had I known, I would have got off my ass and find a photographer
  myself who would accommodate. My wife wanted the responsibility, however.


  Was I the asshole in any of this?'
