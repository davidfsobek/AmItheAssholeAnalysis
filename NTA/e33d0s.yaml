selftext: "UPDATE; will be arranging to visit my daughter at her mothers until my\
  \ girlfriend feels well enough to handle visits from my daughter, I\u2019m also\
  \ going to look into grief counselling for the both of us.\n\n\nI (31M) have been\
  \ with my girlfriend (Claire) for 2 years, 3 in January\n\nI\u2019ve got a 4 year\
  \ old with an ex, we have her every other week.\n\nClaire got pregnant 8 months\
  \ ago, which is why we made the choice to move in with each other, 5 months into\
  \ the pregnancy she gave birth, the baby didn\u2019t make it.\n\nClaire hasn\u2019\
  t been the same since which  while I   don\u2019t fully understand, it was my baby\
  \ too.\n\nClaire has been in therapy since to help her grieve.\n\nWhen my daughter\
  \ came over to visit last, she drew on the wall which I completely understand but\
  \ Claire made a point of sending her up to her bedroom for 90 minutes.\n\nShe continues\
  \ making snide remarks towards my daughters mother and is over all really strict\
  \ on my daughter, any toe out of line it\u2019s straight to her bedroom \n\nClaire\
  \ suggested we don\u2019t have my daughter for a week until we\u2019ve grieved properly\
  \ and maybe stick to weekends and visiting her after school until then.\n\nI told\
  \ her if she continues doing this and continues being spiteful that she can leave,\
  \ she is in no way priority over my daughter?\n\nI understand her grief, I do.\n\
  \nShe\u2019s obviously calling me an AH \n\nAITA?"
