selftext: "Honestly this is so childish but it's causing a lot of drama hence I'm\
  \ on a throwaway\n\nI (F21) went grocery shopping with my roommate and her friend\
  \ 'Jess' (F23). I kind of know this girl but we're not super close. After we got\
  \ done with our shopping and we were taking our bags out of the cart, Jess went\
  \ to leave the cart outside the entrance to the store instead of taking it back\
  \ to the cart storage thing. So I told her to take it back to where it belongs.\n\
  She said, \"It's fine, everyone does it,\" \nSo I insisted that she take it back.\
  \ It was literally a few extra steps away. She refused again. So I offered to do\
  \ it. She said, \"Just leave it, it doesn't matter.\"  \nSo I took the cart back\
  \ and told her, \"You can't just leave it and expect someone else to clear up after\
  \ you, it's really inconsiderate.\"\nMy roommate told me drop the issue but Jess\
  \ was annoying me a bit by this point, so I explained to her that if everyone did\
  \ that and left them all over the parking lot then the poor workers would have to\
  \ go around and gather up all the carts, people wouldn't be able to get into parking\
  \ spaces - it'd just be carnage. I told her she was being lazy and how hard is it\
  \ to follow basic social etiquette. Maybe my tone of voice was a bit harsh but I\
  \ wasn't trying to insinuate anything by calling her lazy, although she is on the\
  \ larger side and didn't like that comment at all.\n\nSo then she throws a bit of\
  \ a tantrum saying things like \"I'm sick of people always telling me what to do!\"\
  \ and \"stop talking to me like I'm stupid!\" and starts crying. So I'm standing\
  \ there outside the store next to a grown-ass woman having a meltdown about a damn\
  \ shopping cart.   \nI told her, 'You're just being childish now.'\n\nMy roommate\
  \ then said, \"Look what you've done, you've made her cry now,\" and asked me to\
  \ apologize to Jess. I apologized for my tone of voice but said I wasn't going to\
  \ apologize for what I said because I wasn't in the wrong. Jess was huffy with me\
  \ and the journey back home was frosty. Since then I've been getting messages off\
  \ mutual friends telling me I was out of line for making her cry. \n\nI honestly\
  \ feel like I've done nothing wrong, she was acting like a total brat over something\
  \ as stupid as a shopping cart and is currently no longer speaking to me, just getting\
  \ other people to send me messages about what a bitch I am. As I've said, I've already\
  \ apologized for my tone(which was sharp but not aggressive) but I'm not going to\
  \ apologize for insisting she act with basic social decency (i.e. putting your damn\
  \ cart back when you've finished using it). I could have just taken back the cart\
  \ myself and not said anything, instead of challenging her on it though so AITA?\n\
  \nETA: So it seems there's a pretty even split as to whether I was TA or not. Just\
  \ a quick update: \n\n1. I did return the cart after Jess refused to do so. I shouldn't\
  \ have escalated the situation. \n\n2. I don't know her that well and I realize\
  \ I'm neither her parent nor boss so that didn't give me the right to tell her off.\
  \ In future I will try to lead by example rather than become annoyed when people\
  \ exhibit uncivic-minded behavior. I am of the view that just because 'everyone\
  \ does it', doesn't make something the right thing to do, but I will watch my tone/\
  \ behavior so as not to come off overly self-righteous. \n\n3. I shouldn't have\
  \ included the comment relating to her physique in the post because it's honestly\
  \ irrelevant. \n\n4. I have decided Jess and I are not compatible for a close friendship,\
  \ and while I will be civil with her on group occasions and I will also no longer\
  \ be giving her rides to the grocery store, etc."
