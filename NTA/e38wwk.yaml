selftext: "Thanksgiving season travel/family time woes. We live on the other side\
  \ of the country and only see my partner's family about once a year. We are back\
  \ east with them this week for the holiday. \n\nI am a woman of color who grew up\
  \ in a very diverse and urban environment and they are from a pretty homogeneous\
  \ suburb. Which is fine, I've just noticed some perspective differences in addition\
  \ to existing cultural ones. My boyfriend has kind of acclimated/expanded some of\
  \ his stuff and is open and interested in new things but that isn't quite true if\
  \ his family. In general, we get on fine and I mostly keep my head down and go with\
  \ the flow.\n\nAnyway, we were at a store yesterday (me plus partner, partner's\
  \ parents and sister) shopping and I overhear some people talking in french, searching\
  \ for an item. I speak French pretty well, so I just replied in French and told\
  \ them where to find the item. Whatever, I did not even think anything of it. \n\
  \nBut my partner's family saw and got kind of weird about it. Eye rolling and all\
  \ that. His dad said something about speaking English in America. I did say that\
  \ there's no official law that says only English is allowed. On the car ride home\
  \ they were like well if you are speaking another language, who knows what you are\
  \ saying about us. (I literally told her what aisle to go down, so I just wish they'd\
  \ calm down).\n\nFast forward to Thanksgiving tonight with the extended family,\
  \ and the mom starts like telling the rest of them in this backhanded way. Like\
  \ I am this snob for knowing how to speak another language and replying to someone\
  \ in it? And the family are teasing and I kind of snapped back. \n\nI told them\
  \ that it's not my fault I am well educated and have been exposed to more of the\
  \ world than their small white suburbs have to offer. The world doesn't revolve\
  \ around them and speaking only one language isn't exactly something to be proud\
  \ of. My boyfriend tried to make peace but also stood up for me. He also told them\
  \ their future grandchildren are going to be bilingual since I plan to teach them.\
  \ \n\nSo we left, and I said I didn't want to visit with them tomorrow. I need a\
  \ break and some cool off time. I am not preventing my boyfriend from hanging out,\
  \ but he said he was staying with me. Now our phones are blowing up with texts,\
  \ saying I am being in reasonable, can't take a joke, and keeping the family apart.\
  \ \n\nI just feel really frustrated. \n\nAm I the asshole for not spending the rest\
  \ of the visit with my partner's family? I think they are bogus in calling it teasing\
  \ or a joke, but even if it was I feel insulted. I should be obliged to spend time\
  \ people that are rude to me. Also I am not making my boyfriend do anything so they\
  \ shouldn't blame me for that either. \n\nUgh."
