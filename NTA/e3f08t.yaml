selftext: "So basically every year my family and I drive a few hours East to visit\
  \ our grandparents and extended family for Thanksgiving. This year it was decided\
  \ that since most of my siblings now had SO's (including me) that we would need\
  \ to take separate cars to drive or we would need to get plane tickets. My sister\
  \ (26F) and my girlfriend (20F) and me (20M) all decided that we would take my car\
  \ and would switch drivers if I got tired. \n\nNow I have a very strong relationship\
  \ with my sister. We are very close and always have been. \n\nSo this is what actually\
  \ happened. We were on our way back from thanksgiving dinner and going to where\
  \ we were staying for the night. I turn around and notice that my sister was not\
  \ wearing her seatbelt. Now due to getting in an accident 2 years ago and browsing\
  \ r/idiotsincars I am very strict about safety while driving. Especially when it\
  \ is my car and I am who am driving. \n\nSo I ask her to put on her seatbelt. She\
  \ laughs it off and just looks at her phone and ignores me. so me and my dramatic\
  \ self decided to make an ordeal out of it. I pull over on the side of the road,\
  \ flip on my hazards, and turn around with a joking smile. I playfully announce\
  \ that I will not be moving the car until she puts on her seatbelt. She replies\
  \ with \"don't be a dick\". Now see that's what got me, my sister and I NEVER have\
  \ cussed at each other in a non-joking or derogatory way. It caught me off guard.\
  \ So I replied with \"well stop being an asshole\". Turned around and restated that\
  \ I will not be moving the car until she puts on her seatbelt. \n\nI pull out my\
  \ phone, click on some Disney+, and wait for her to comply. Well she gets really\
  \ smug and pops in her ear buds to do the same. \n\nMy girlfriend, who has been\
  \ in the passenger seat, started \"arguing\" over which dish was our favorites\"\
  . She makes the comment \"why can't you just agree with me\" and then my sister\
  \ interjects from the backseat with \"because he's a little bitch with control issues\"\
  . \n\nOkay so now I'm piping hot. I turn around with \"well you have other siblings\
  \ you can ride back with. You are no longer welcome in this fucking car. So once\
  \ we get back get all your shit out of here\" so after that she said \"with fucking\
  \ pleasure\". I pulled back onto the road and went back to where we were sleeping\
  \ and it was a completely silent trip. Once we parked she slammed my door shut and\
  \ stormed off.  \n\nOnce we got inside I Venmo her back all the gas money she had\
  \ paid me with the caption \":)\". \n\nShe sends me a Snapchat that basically said\
  \ this \"you would have reacted the same way had the situation been reversed\" to\
  \ which I replied with basically \"I would never have started the name calling\"\
  .\n\nTL;DR sister doesn't put on seatbelt, I kick her out of my car.\n\nEDIT: I\
  \ just wanted to let everyone know that my sister came back and we bashed it out.\
  \ We talked it over and she apologized for being not following my car rules and\
  \ the name calling. I apologized for the name calling as well. We are now loading\
  \ the car back up and preparing to head back to Florida tonight."
title: AITA? My sister didn't put on her seatbelt so I kicked her out of my car.
