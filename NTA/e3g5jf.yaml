selftext: 'I was given up for adoption when I was 6 months old. I was born profoundly
  deaf.


  I ended being adopted by two insane people who made my life miserable. I cut off
  contact with them once I went to university and have been relatively happier since.


  I recently looked for my birth parents and was able to track them down.


  They are actually married to each other and have three kids.


  So this is what pissed me off. My siblings are 25, 20 and 16. I''m 23. Also, they
  seemed to come from rich families.


  I messaged both of them on Facebook and they ended up meeting me. They were very
  clearly guilty and my birth mother ended up crying and said they gave me up because
  they were told I''d have mental disabilities growing up. And if they''d known, they
  wouldn''t have given me up at all. Instead, they told everyone I died.


  I was not able to accept this at all. It just made me angrier. I told them I''d
  tell everyone about how they abandoned me. Especially since they had the means to
  care for me.


  This freaked them out because they had a lot to lose.


  It suddenly devolved into a weird situation where first they paid off my study loans.


  Then I started getting money every month to "make up" for the years I struggled.
  I never asked for any of this but I didn''t stop them either.


  The amount of money they''re giving me is nearly three times more than what I make
  at my job.


  I''m not going to lie, I am enjoying this financial "pay-off". I haven''t told anyone
  about it and I''m saving most of it so I can retire early. I''m also going on trips
  I could have never dreamed of affording.


  But a part of me feels like I''m extorting from these people. Another part of feels
  like I deserve it. They deprived me of a good family life so they should pay.


  AITA?


  Sorry if I didn''t explain everything properly. English isn''t my first language.'
