selftext: "So this happened a while ago and a recent story on here reminded me of\
  \ this.\n\nI was walking out of my grocery store with some bags. The lady that was\
  \ parked next to me had her cart behind my car so I couldn\u2019t get out. I wasn\u2019\
  t to worried because she was about done unloading her cart and she seen me put my\
  \ bags in my car. I thought she would move the cart. Nope. She left it behind my\
  \ car and got in her truck. I was really annoyed and felt petty so, while she was\
  \ in her truck on her phone I got out of my car and pushed her cart behind her truck.\
  \ Back in my car, backed out and drove up to the red light to turn out of there.\
  \ Well, just before the light turned green I herd some metal crunching and looked\
  \ back in my mirror, she ran the cart over and was yelling. I just went home. Its\
  \ not hard to put your cart back especially when we were parked right next to one\
  \ of the cart holders in the parking lot, not even two spaces away.\n\nEdit: Her\
  \ truck was jacked up so it was almost fully under there. She must of whipped out\
  \ her spot the way the cart looked to be under there. Cart was mangled.\n\nEdit\
  \ 2: Thank you kind stranger for the silver.\nBut to clear some things up, I did\
  \ NOT expect her to run over the cart like she did. I just wanted to mildly annoy\
  \ and inconvenience her like she did me. Also, I\u2019m sorry for the poor grammar\
  \ and spelling. I\u2019m dyslexic and working on it. Also also NOT CAT DEFINITELY\
  \ NOT CAT.\n\nEdit 3: I need to specify more once again. When I say in edit 2 \u201C\
  inconvenience her like she did me\u201D I mean her get out her truck and move the\
  \ cart. I didn\u2019t even want her to tap the cart. The reason I posted this here\
  \ is because I felt bad about how she ran over the cart and felt guilt about it\
  \ and I needed third party options that weren\u2019t friends/family. I did leave\
  \ the cart in sight of the mirror. Also after all the comments I don\u2019t feel\
  \ bad anymore. She should of looked and could of possibly killed someone ....or\
  \ a cat. Thank you everyone"
