selftext: "I went home for Thanksgiving, and my 17 year old brother has been into\
  \ making YouTube videos for a while. He wants to be the next Jake/Logan Paul to\
  \ give you an idea of his content\n\nI had been having a rough day; I had a minor\
  \ but scary car accident on the way over (someone sideswiped me on the highway,\
  \ and did a hit and run, I was shaken up and worried about the cost of repairs)\n\
  \nI'd also had a recent breakup and I wasn't feeling great about coming to Thanksgiving\
  \ alone when all my siblings and cousins were bringing dates.\n\nPlus, my family\
  \ can get really argumentative about politics and stuff sometimes so I wasn't interested\
  \ in having my uncles try to get me to talk politics with them, for example.\n\n\
  Anyway, I got to my parent's house and rang the bell. And my brother answered the\
  \ door and threw some kind of white powder in my face yelling \"pranked!!\" and\
  \ some shit about cocaine. I didn't think that was literally what it is, he's 17\
  \ and broke lol. I also saw his girlfriend with a camera behind him \n\nBut it was\
  \ just kind of the last straw that day, I slammed the door in his face, and got\
  \ back into my car, and was out of there like a bat out of hell. \n\nI stopped at\
  \ a gas station and cleaned up, it looked like it was just flour or bacing soda\
  \ or baby powder or something on my face and hair. But honestly I was still mad\
  \ and hurt that was how I was greeted, and I really didn't want it ending up on\
  \ YouTube. So I texted my family group chat \"I do NOT CONSENT to video of me being\
  \ filmed or shared. (State) is a two-party consent state for recordings in private\
  \ spaces. If anything is uploaded and I need to handle this legally, it is written\
  \ that I DID NOT CONSENT TO BEING ON VIDEO OR HAVING THAT VIDEO ON YOUTUBE\" \n\n\
  I know that probably sounds like a lot to say but I was really fed up by other times\
  \ my brother tried to get everyone on his channel and I wanted my privacy, and my\
  \ friend in law school had said to say that, if it came up again\n\n I honestly\
  \ just wanted to go home so I got back in my car and did the 2.5 hour drive home.\n\
  \nI wasn't on my phone on the drive, because obviously I was driving and paying\
  \ attention. So I missed a bunch of calls and texts from my parents and brother.\n\
  \nOnce I got home, my voicemail was full and my parents had texted me a lot too.\
  \ Putting it all together, apparently everyone was confused why I'd left, and what\
  \ the text was about, until my brother fessed up to the prank. Then they wanted\
  \ me to come back and us to make nice, and then when I wasn't picking up my phone\
  \ they got mad at me for not being there or explaining a thing. They were mad that\
  \ dinner got delayed in the confusion and it was awkward.\n\nFor what it's worth,\
  \ I had a good night, two of my friends who are not from the US were having a chill\
  \ friendsgiving and I joined them.\n\nAITA for having walked out so suddenly? I\
  \ felt at the end of my rope but my family is mad."
