selftext: "I\u2019m 29 years old, broke, homeless, don\u2019t have a job, and I struggle\
  \ with addiction. My family has a history of ill mental health and I got hit with\
  \ the bipolar stick too and I\u2019ve been officially diagnosed with clinical depression\
  \ and bipolar disorder. \n\nBasically I\u2019m about as child free as you can get\
  \ because I don\u2019t want to pass down a lifetime of shitty genetics and even\
  \ shittier living habits to an innocent kid. \n\nMy FWB knew this because we\u2019\
  ve had many discussions on how we\u2019d both be unfit parents and as such I always\
  \ make sure to wear protection. She uses the pill but hey, here we are, she\u2019\
  s pregnant and she\u2019s insisting it\u2019s mine. \n\nI told her that there\u2019\
  s no way I\u2019m about to be a dad. I simply can\u2019t do it. I\u2019ll find the\
  \ money to pay whatever I got to pay her but I\u2019m not about to play daddy when\
  \ I never wanted this. She in turn has reached out to our friend group and one by\
  \ one they\u2019ve turned on me and told me I\u2019m worthless for not wanting to\
  \ step up to be a father.\n\n\n\n#Hi yall, I\u2019m not the OP. I\u2019m the friend\
  \ that let him type his situation up on my phone. He handed me the phone back yesterday\
  \ because he was getting even more down reading the comments. I\u2019ve been getting\
  \ notifications on my phone all day about it. Some of the comments he was getting\
  \ was asking him to kill himself, that he hopes his next heroin hit will finish\
  \ him off etc. There were a few awesome comments that I tried to show him but he\
  \ just asked me to delete the post. I\u2019m not gonna do that, but I\u2019m disappointed\
  \ that people on Reddit are so cruel. The link I\u2019ve left is one of the \u2018\
  nicer\u2019 comments.\n\nhttps://ibb.co/VgrD1JD"
