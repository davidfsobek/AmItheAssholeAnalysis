selftext: "Title sounds pretty terrible, but I didn\u2019t know how else to phrase\
  \ it.\n\nMy best friend had a son unexpectedly a few years ago. We\u2019re part\
  \ of a very close social circle, and we all have done our best to support her through\
  \ raising him. I can\u2019t speak for all of us but I know I love him dearly, like\
  \ a godson.\n\nProblem is, little dude\u2019s a threenager. He has attitude out\
  \ the ass. (He\u2019s destroyed a pair of my shoes and cut a lock of my hair off).\
  \ This wouldn\u2019t be a problem \u2014 just scold him, make it clear it isn\u2019\
  t okay and give an appropriate punishment. Right? But no. My best friend is in this\
  \ free-love parenting phase where she wants to be his sole disciplinarian. Meaning\
  \ we can\u2019t tell him no, ask him to stop or anything when he does something\
  \ wrong.\n\nThus, the predictable habit has emerged where he denies whatever he\
  \ does when her back is turned. She also has a policy of \u201Calways believing\
  \ her child over anyone so that he can always trust her\u201D, so none of his destructive\
  \ behavior is ever addressed.\n\nNow, the specific story. I have a keychain with\
  \ a locket sort of thing on it. Inside is a picture of my sister who is deceased.\
  \ Little man got his hands on it and tried to pry it in half while his mom was in\
  \ the kitchen making smoothies. I said \u201Chey, *his name*, give that back. It\
  \ belongs to me,\u201D he made a mischievous face and bit down on it. I went to\
  \ swipe it out of his grasp and he ran to the window and flung it outside (they\
  \ live in a fourth story apartment). \n\nI screamed \u201CNO. NO. You do NOT DO\
  \ THAT.\u201D\n\nHe started bawling and ran for his mom, who stormed into the room\
  \ **absolutely livid**. After a lecture about how I\u2019m not supposed to discipline\
  \ her child, she refused to hear my side of what happened, kicked me out and will\
  \ not speak to me at all.\n\nI grabbed the locket off the fire escape before I left\
  \ so it\u2019s been recovered.\n\nAITA?"
title: "AITA (F 23) for disregarding my friend\u2019s (22 F) wishes regarding how\
  \ to \u201Cparent\u201D her son (3 M) ?"
