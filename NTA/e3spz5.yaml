selftext: "I teach communication and journalism in an Australian institution.  We\
  \ have strict policies about assignment submission, which must all be written in\
  \ Australian English. There is lots of information about this policy on the website,\
  \ students are emailed a copy of it, and I talk about it in the first couple of\
  \ lectures.  We also provide help to students who are struggling.  And although\
  \ it seems pedantic, as these are students who hope to work in Australia, writing\
  \ for Australian organisations and Australian audiences, the academic council thought\
  \ it was appropriate.\n\nThe students are given a guide on how to write properly,\
  \ a copy of the policy, links to find academic support and contact details for all\
  \ lecturers so they can approach us for help if they need it.   For the first assignment,\
  \ I point out any errors but don't mark them down for them. \n\n This year, I had\
  \ one student who, despite everything, insisted on submitting her assignments in\
  \ US English.  She claimed it was her native language and it was unfair of us to\
  \ expect her to learn a new one.   I put her request to the academic council and\
  \ they rejected it.  She was told it was a requirement of the course that she be\
  \ proficient in Australian English, and that as she passed the entrance literacy\
  \ exam, she was clearly able to demonstrate that proficiency.   I was told to mark\
  \ her assignments to the same standard as everyone else.  She continued to submit\
  \ in US English and continued to average around 10% for each assessment.  Had she\
  \ done them properly, she would have averaged around 55%.  At the end of the year,\
  \ she failed the course.  She came to see me in tears and was distraught.  She genuinely\
  \ thought we would see things her way and the marks we gave her wouldn't count.\
  \  She wanted to resubmit her assessments and write them in Australian English.\
  \  She claimed we were discriminating against her because of her nationality and\
  \ that, if she were in her native country, this wouldn't happen.  I told her no,\
  \ it was too late and that she could redo the course next semester and maybe she'd\
  \ have a better understanding of what was required.  She lodged a formal complaint\
  \ against me, my department and the tutor.  It was duly investigated and dismissed.\
  \  She told me I was an arsehole and wished much misfortune upon me.   Since then,\
  \ several students of the same nationality have contacted the department and complained\
  \ about the way she was treated.  AITA?"
