selftext: "My sister recently went through a messy break up and has come to stay with\
  \ me while she gets herself back on her feet. She has been here a month and I\u2019\
  m not sure when she is leaving. Unfortunately, her 1 year old daughter is allergic\
  \ to my cat. My niece has been sneezing, itching, coughing, etc. My sister expects\
  \ me to get rid of my cat. I  don\u2019t have any friends near me to care for my\
  \ cat while she stays, so I asked my parents. My parents refused because they claim\
  \ my cat is too destructive because she is not declawed, and I won\u2019t be doing\
  \ that based on personal opinion. My sister has a rocky relationship with my parents\
  \ so her staying with them is most likely her last resort. My sister says I\u2019\
  m being unreasonable for picking the cat over my niece/her. I do care for my niece\
  \ but I feel like I shouldn\u2019t have to give up my cat in my own home. AITA?\n\
  \nEdit: I\u2019m not sure if my sister has any place to go if she doesn\u2019t stay\
  \ with me. My parents and my sister haven\u2019t spoken for over a year due to other,\
  \ personal issues. She first suggested I find a temporary home for my cat but options\
  \ are limited. My sister also is unemployed but looking for work. She doesn\u2019\
  t have the money to pay for allergy care, which is why she suggested rehoming. The\
  \ father of my niece is not part of her life so she cannot stay with him.\n\nUPDATE:\
  \ I actually showed my sister some of this thread, so thank you for all of the responses.\
  \ I\u2019ve decided to pay for allergy care, and see where it goes from there. I\
  \ appreciate the suggestions in the replies! No, I am not getting rid of my cat\
  \ regardless. We have decided if my niece is still having a tough time my sister\
  \ will stay with my parents. My parents were never against her living with them,\
  \ it was my sister who was trying to avoid it. Thank you again everyone for your\
  \ responses."
