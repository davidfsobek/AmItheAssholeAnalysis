selftext: "I have a pretty clich\xE9 life story. My mother was an immigrant to the\
  \ US and married my father. I had the dream childhood that any kid could ask for.\
  \ When I was 18, my parents divorced because my dad got the hots for his co-worker's\
  \ wife. They got married and went on to live their happily ever after. \n\nMeanwhile,\
  \ my mother packed her shit and moved back to her home country. To be closer to\
  \ my mother, I started applying for colleges in her country. My younger brother\
  \ who was 16 at that time stayed back in the US for a year and then started applying\
  \ for college in my mom's country. \n\nA year after they got married, my father\
  \ had his baby. When she was born, neither me nor my brother were there in the US\
  \ to meet her. \n\nMy father sent us her pictures and that was it. Meanwhile, I\
  \ got busy with my college and then my job. I met my boyfriend and we are planning\
  \ on getting married. I plan to live in my mother's country permanently. \n\nNow\
  \ me and my brother haven't seen our father since we both left the States. Recently,\
  \ we got the news that our half sister got diagnosed with leukaemia and wanted to\
  \ meet us. Apparently, my father promised her every christmas that we (me and my\
  \ brother) were going to visit her next year. I only found out about his promise\
  \ when he requested me and my brother to fly down to the US to meet her in the hospital.\
  \ \n\nI told my father that we would definitely come down to meet her, but it would\
  \ have to be a month or two later as my brother was busy with his med school semester\
  \ exams and I was busy with a very important work project, and I could miss out\
  \ on a very important promotion if I bailed in the middle of the ongoing work. \n\
  \nHe was sad but he insisted us to reconsider because she was getting sicker. He\
  \ even said that he would pay for the flight tickets. I promised him that we would\
  \ definitely come down to visit her after I was done with my work and my brother\
  \ was done with his exams. \n\n2 weeks later my half sister passed away. I felt\
  \ sorry for my father and emailed him to send him my condolences. \n\nA week later\
  \ was what would have been her 8th birthday. My father's wife made a very emotional\
  \ social media post celebrating her life and expressing sadness about her own family\
  \ \"abandoning\" her. \n\nI knew she was talking about me and my brother. \n\nNow\
  \ here's the thing. \n\nI don't think we abandoned her, we weren't able to meet\
  \ her because the timing wasn't right. I had worked really hard for that promotion\
  \ and its really hard for women in my line of work to get that promotion. It was\
  \ a rare opportunity for me and I didn't want to give that up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit\
  \ :  the hate messages are lovely."
