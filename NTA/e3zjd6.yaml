selftext: "Ciao, good people of Reddit. Please judge me. \n\nHere\u2019s the situation:\
  \ \n\nAround August of this past year, my boyfriend of ~8 months suggested that\
  \ we move into our own place. At that time, we\u2019d been living in an apartment\
  \ with two other roommates. \n\nI was a bit hesitant, for a couple of reasons: first,\
  \ our relationship was a bit rocky just then. We\u2019d nearly broken up a month\
  \ prior, and I was having some doubts about his commitment to the relationship.\
  \ So I voiced this to him, and he assured me that he was 100% committed to us, and\
  \ that I didn\u2019t have anything to worry about. My second concern was that we\
  \ would be moving into a place that I couldn\u2019t afford on my income alone; our\
  \ income ratio was about 4:1, with him making considerably more than I. Again, though,\
  \ he said it wouldn\u2019t be a problem for us to split rent accordingly. \n\nSo\
  \ we move in together in this truly beautiful apartment that has a pool, free heat\
  \ and hot water - pretty much the ideal scenario for young professionals. We paint,\
  \ decorate, and overall sink quite a bit of money into the new place. And, at my\
  \ suggestion, all of the utilities (electric, gas, and internet) are in my name\
  \ because I\u2019m trying to rebuild my credit. \n\nWell, doesn\u2019t it just fucking\
  \ figure that we\u2019re living in the apartment for about a month, and I come home\
  \ from work one day ~1am and he tells me that he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s going\
  \ to work out between us. He then basically tells me that salvaging our relationship\
  \ isn\u2019t possible, and that I\u2019m probably going to have to move out. Of\
  \ course, this poses a bit of a problem for me, because after the moving costs and\
  \ the rent, I pretty much have no money. I tell him this, and he\u2019s basically\
  \ of the opinion that the money issue is just an \u201Cinconvenience\u201D and not\
  \ a real obstacle, and proceeds to tell me, \u201CIf you\u2019re working two jobs\
  \ and can\u2019t afford to move out, you\u2019re doing something wrong.\u201D \n\
  \nSo, I\u2019m pretty pissed at this point, and I call my parents and ask if I can\
  \ come home. They say yes, so I pack up and go back to my parents\u2019 house. I\
  \ call both my work places and ask if I can take a leave of absence until I figure\
  \ something out, they say no, and I end up getting fired from both. Cool. \n\nIt\u2019\
  s been about two full months now, and I\u2019m actually recovering pretty well.\
  \ But here\u2019s the thing: we had a promotional deal on our internet where we\
  \ got the first three months free, and it\u2019s going to expire on Monday. Since\
  \ it\u2019s under my name, my plan is just to terminate the service. WIBTA if I\
  \ did that without telling my ex? \n\ntldr; ex asked me to move in together, then\
  \ changed his mind. Internet is in my name, and I don\u2019t plan on continuing\
  \ to be the primary account holder for an apartment that\u2019s no longer mine.\
  \ WIBTA for canceling the service once our \u2018First 3 Months Free\u2019 deal\
  \ expires on Monday?\n\nEdit to Clarify: I\u2019m going to cancel everything, no\
  \ matter what. I\u2019m just wondering if I would be an asshole if I did it without\
  \ telling him.\n\nEdit: Wow! This ended up getting way more traction than I thought\
  \ it would. There are a few things I want to clarify, since it seems like a lot\
  \ of questions are getting repeated: \n\n- Yes, I know my story seems like it\u2019\
  s missing info. There is a character limit, so I\u2019m doing my best to answer\
  \ pertinent questions in the comments. \n\n- No, I\u2019m not so pathetic that I\
  \ \u201Ccouldn\u2019t cope\u201D after a year-long relationship ended. That\u2019\
  s not why I requested a leave of absence. I requested the leave because I had nowhere\
  \ to stay other than my parents\u2019 home, and they live several hours by car from\
  \ where my jobs were. I don\u2019t have a car - I was getting to work via public\
  \ transit. I wasn\u2019t intending to stay with my parents long-term, and asked\
  \ for a leave of absence so I could try to figure out a new housing situation, but\
  \ I was an at-will employee at both my jobs, which were unskilled positions (one\
  \ in reception, one in food service). So, yeah, within about a week of each other,\
  \ both bosses told me it was probably just easier for them to replace me than wait\
  \ for me to come back to the area. \n\n- I wasn\u2019t on the lease for the apartment\
  \ because my ex and I suspected that with my credit score as poor as it was, we\
  \ wouldn\u2019t get approved. So sadly, he didn\u2019t violate any eviction laws\
  \ since I was only a \u201Cguest\u201D in the eyes of the law. \n\n- All other bills\
  \ and things have been transferred. I just forgot about the Internet because it\
  \ wasn\u2019t a monthly expense that I had to deal with while I was living there."
