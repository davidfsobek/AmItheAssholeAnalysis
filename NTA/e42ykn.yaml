selftext: "**UPDATE:** \n\n**tl;dr**: I will write basic holiday messages (\"Happy\
  \ Thanksgiving! Love, X and Y\"), and my husband will do the grunt work of buying\
  \ and sending the cards. He absolutely has my back when it comes to dealing with\
  \ his mother, and I think it's reasonable for me to do these small, silly things\
  \ to keep her happy.\n\nThank you all for the responses.\n\n---\n\nI want to clarify\
  \ some things that people either misread or I did not put in the initial post:\n\
  \n1. I stated that I do *not* like writing cards, just seeing people happy when\
  \ I succeed. Those cards that I give to my coworkers are not holiday bullshit, but\
  \ only for rather rare occasions of people I care about leaving the company, being\
  \ promoted, etc. I've written 3 total. Writing thoughtful cards is excruciating,\
  \ and I assumed his mother expected thoughtful cards like that every year for the\
  \ holidays.\n\n2. Neither his parents nor mine are originally from the US. Mine\
  \ immigrated before I was born, his when he was already a teenager. Both of us have\
  \ limited experience with American family traditions. \n\n3. It may not be the case\
  \ for the cards specifically, but my MIL is pretty sexist. There are some parts\
  \ of her that I like a lot, especially the extent to which she tries to bond with\
  \ me and the other DILs, e.g. by teaching us how to cook traditional recipes. She\
  \ is a very generous, loving woman. However, she does have strict expectations for\
  \ the role of wife/daughter, believing that it is my duty to serve her and my husband.\
  \ It has been a point of contention between her and my husband when I do horrible\
  \ things like *gasp* have him help with cleaning up. I thought she didn't mind all\
  \ that much with me specifically, as she seemed much harsher with her other DILs.\n\
  \n----\n\nWhat actually happened:\n\nSome time after his mother made the comment\
  \ to me about Christmas cards, she dragged my husband away from the party and tore\
  \ his head off for \"letting [me] get so bad.\" My husband spared me the details,\
  \ but they had a long, nasty screaming match about me until his father interrupted.\
  \ So he was in a really bad mood about this. \n\nMeanwhile, I had started thinking\
  \ about that look they'd shared and previous small things where he tried to get\
  \ me to lie back and go along with his mother's ridiculous demands. (For example,\
  \ that same dinner his brother had brought some vodka, mostly for my benefit because\
  \ he knew how much I liked it. He even proclaimed that he got it mostly for me.\
  \ But his mother declared that it was not for the women to drink, and my husband\
  \ begged me to roll over, so I did. [Turns out one of the guests was pregnant, and\
  \ this was my MIL's weird way of not making her feel excluded]) So I was also mad\
  \ by the end of the night.\n\nSo when my husband brought up the cards, both of us\
  \ very quickly went pig-brained. But we love each other very much, and stayed up\
  \ quite late apologizing to each other and discussing his mother. It turns out that\
  \ my husband has been pretty aggressive about keeping her from getting on my case\
  \ the way she does with the other DILs, but he didn't want to go completely nuclear,\
  \ so wanted me to still do the small things. I guess he has told me about this before,\
  \ though not explicitly enough, so I didn't realise that this was his grand strategy.\
  \ It is the case that she has never stepped on any big boundaries of mine, thanks\
  \ to my husband's interference. I am totally okay with doing other small things\
  \ to maintain a decent relationship with my MIL.\n\nWriting the cards is definitely\
  \ a small thing, so I will write in my beautiful cursive in the card and on the\
  \ envelope, and my husband will handle the logistics.\n\n----\n\n**ORIGINAL:**\n\
  \                \nThe day after Thanksgiving, my husband and I went over to his\
  \ parents' house. When I was chatting with his mother, she politely asked why we\
  \ hadn't sent cards to them wishing a happy Thanksgiving. I told her I wasn't aware\
  \ of such a tradition, as my family wasn't the sort to send cards of any kind (we\
  \ don't even do birthday cards). She said to keep it it in mind for Christmas. I\
  \ called over my husband, and told him that his mother wanted him to send cards\
  \ for the holidays. Though I didn't think much of it then, my husband and his mother\
  \ exchanged a look.\n\nBelow is a very poor approximation of the conversation we\
  \ had when we got home. I believe all these points were brought up, though probably\
  \ in a different order and with more fleshed out supporting arguments on both sides.\n\
  \n**Husband**: *(jokingly)* Make sure to set a reminder for a few days before Christmas\
  \ so that you don't forget to write cards this time!\n\n**Me**: It's your family.\
  \ Shouldn't you write the cards?\n\n**Husband**: I think it would be better if you\
  \ do it. I'm not very good at this sort of thing, and I think it would make my mother\
  \ happier to see it come from you.\n\n**Me**: I am also not good at this sort of\
  \ thing, and I obviously have far less experience with it (holiday cards) than you\
  \ do. And you don't care enough to do it. Why do you expect me to care more about\
  \ your family than you do?\n\n**Husband**: I just think it would be easier for you\
  \ than for me, and the outcome would be better. *(getting annoyed)* Is is that hard\
  \ for you to do?\n\n**Me**: I disagree that it would be easier for me. And I refuse\
  \ to fall into the hole of bullshit administrative tasks that get relegated to women.\
  \ I saw that in my own parents' marriage --\n\n**Husband**: *(very annoyed)* Oh\
  \ my God, not everything is about that! You're just arguing for the sake of arguing!\
  \ You haven't even said that you hate the task itself! I've seen the cards you write\
  \ your coworkers!\n\n**Me**: Ok, I don't want to argue either. My coworkers, I write\
  \ the cards. Your family, you write the cards.\n\nTo be fair, I do argue for the\
  \ sake of arguing sometimes. Though I do not like the process of writing cards,\
  \ I am good at it and I like seeing my coworkers' and friends' positive reactions.\
  \ But out of principle, I do not want to become responsible for keeping track of\
  \ my husband's social obligations. I have seen it in my parents' and in my friends'\
  \ marriages, and it leads to huge resentment in the women. For my husband's own\
  \ sake, better he suffer putting in a little effort than me blowing up over this\
  \ bullshit."
