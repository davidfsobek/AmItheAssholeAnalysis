selftext: "My husband and I are big on no shoes in the house. We have some white carpeting,\
  \ the floors get dirtier faster, and there\u2019s some nasty stuff we track on the\
  \ bottom of our shoes. We leave our shoes at the door, and we ask guests to do the\
  \ same if they don\u2019t remember to/see ours at the door and follow suit. \n\n\
  So my husband and I had a get together at our house tonight with our old college\
  \ roommates. As everyone arrived, they either took their shoes off immediately or\
  \ did once we mentioned it to them. I was really polite about this to everyone.\
  \ One of our friends arrived a little later (her first time at our house) and she\
  \ walked into the kitchen to greet us. I said hi and gave her a hug and then asked\
  \ if she would mind putting her shoes by the door. In response:\n\nF: what?\n \n\
  Me: We\u2019re trying to keep the floors a little cleaner so we\u2019re keeping\
  \ the shoes by the door if you don\u2019t mind \n\nF: I kinda mind, my feet will\
  \ get cold and I don\u2019t want to walk around in just my socks \n\nMe: I have\
  \ thicker socks if you\u2019d like to borrow some\n\nF: You know this is kinda ridiculous\n\
  \nMe: I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s asking a lot, it\u2019s just a couple of\
  \ hours \n\nAfter that she rolled her eyes and put her shoes by the door. I thanked\
  \ her, but we didn\u2019t say anything else about it and the rest of the night was\
  \ a little tense between her and I. I tried to joke around and move on, I offered\
  \ her more food and snacks, she wasn\u2019t responsive to it. Once everyone started\
  \ leaving, I stopped her at the door (not within earshot of anyone else) and asked\
  \ if she was okay, and she said \u201CSure, but don\u2019t expect me back here anytime\
  \ soon\u201D, and left. \n\nMy husband got a text from one of the others tonight\
  \ saying that our friend was really angry, that I had embarrassed her (we\u2019\
  ve all known each other for years and were college roommates so that seems a little\
  \ far to me), and that I needed to apologize to her and the rest of the group. \n\
  \nNeither of us have replied and I feel conflicted. Truthfully, she\u2019s not the\
  \ first guest we\u2019ve had that has been a little annoyed about our request, and\
  \ I get that it\u2019s not always very convenient. We just feel very strongly about\
  \ keeping our house clean and free of the gross things that are on the bottoms of\
  \ our shoes. \n\nAITA for asking her to take off her shoes?\n\nEdit: I\u2019ve seen\
  \ a lot of responses mention this so I want to clarify:\nThe only reason I insisted\
  \ that my friend take her shoes off is because we\u2019ve been friends for 8 years,\
  \ roommates for 3, and I know her very well. She never wore shoes in our house in\
  \ college, and I\u2019m guessing now this was a way for her to grab some attention.\
  \ \n\nAll of the people at the gathering were also my former roommates, everyone\
  \ was comfortable with each other. If this was a different situation with different\
  \ people, I wouldn\u2019t have been so insistent if they were uncomfortable. \n\n\
  Are there really this many of you that have never considered taking your shoes off?!"
