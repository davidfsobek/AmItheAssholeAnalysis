selftext: "Okay this is on mobile, I just need a basic ruling and some advice. \n\n\
  My little sister (11)\nMy older brother (26)\nMy sister in law (25)\nMe (19f)\n\n\
  So my little sister wants to spend time with my older brother. Since she was born\
  \ they\u2019ve had a really close bond so that\u2019s not unusual. It\u2019s not\
  \ something out of the blue. They used to do it when she was a lot younger. \n\n\
  She wants to go see a movie, go to dinner, or really anything. The problem is that\
  \ she basically just wants it to be just her and my brother. It also doesn\u2019\
  t have to be often either, the kid would be fine if it was just once a year. They\
  \ haven\u2019t done it in years and honestly before you know it she\u2019s gonna\
  \ be a teenager and not want to spend any time with all of us. \n\nMy sister in\
  \ law says it would excluding her and used this as an example, \u201CWhat if in\
  \ 5 years **** and I have a family and told her she couldn\u2019t be involved.\u201D\
  \  She also claims my little sister is being vindictive and/or wanting to see our\
  \ older brother as a father figure. \n\nFor a little back story: Our dad is terminally\
  \ ill and can\u2019t do basic things with her, our mom is his full time caregiver.\
  \ He\u2019s also in a wheelchair. \n\nMy opinion is who is it actually hurting for\
  \ an 11 year old and her older brother to spend some sibling time? I could be biased\
  \ because I am one of the siblings but I don\u2019t see the harm in my brother setting\
  \ aside an hour or two every 6 months to a year, to spend time with our little sister.\
  \ \n\nEspecially because she has had it so rough for her entire life that she honestly\
  \ just needs a win. This whole situation makes her cry at least 4 times a week and\
  \ she doesn\u2019t understand why he won\u2019t do it anymore. It\u2019s heartbreaking\
  \ because at the end of the day she is an 11 year old child."
