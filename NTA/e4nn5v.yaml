selftext: 'I am STEAMING mad about this and everyone around me is pretending like
  I''m being a cunt. I''ll let you people decide. First, I sew my own clothes. My
  husband and I live in a very nice house with a HUGE room filled with gorgeous sunlight
  for my hobbies.


  We hosted Thanksgiving. My SIL and her three kids were staying with us, despite
  that she always treats me like shit for preferring pets over kids.


  On Tuesday, as I went to do some last-minute shopping, my SIL texted about a tablecloth
  for her kids to put down while they did Christmas ornaments. I walked her through
  the closet with the VERY. CLEARLY. MARKED. TABLECLOTHS.


  I got home 3 hours later and checked in on everyone. When I went into the hobby
  room where everyone was gathered, I saw it. SHE PULLED MY FUCKING ATELIER BRUNETTE
  FABRIC FROM THE CLOSET. MARKED. FABRIC. This particular style was discontinued several
  years ago, but I snagged for $25/yard. I had 6 yards. Let me note that fabric is
  EXPENSIVE and I have always sourced from thrift stores, deep clearance, etc. This
  was a GIFT to myself.


  I fucking screamed "What the hell are you doing?!" and ran to the table. She looked
  alarmed and acted like she had no idea what she''d done. Her fucking kids spilled
  all kinds of paint all over the fabric. I told everyone to STOP, put DOWN the crafts,
  and get OUT.


  After I fucking cried over that fabric and tried my best to salvage it, I demanded
  she replace it, and said how. She argued that she had no way of knowing that "ugly
  ass" fabric was for something other than a tablecloth, because it didn''t look like
  anything anyone would ever wear seriously. I said I expected 6 yards.


  Black Friday she and the girls handed me a JoAnn Fabric bag. They handed me 6 yards
  of an absolutely hideous Keepsake Calico fabric. Typically $9.99/yard but on sale
  for $3.99 this weekend.


  I asked her if she was being serious, and she said yes, here''s 6 yards of ugly
  ass fabric. I deadpanned "Get the fuck out of my house. Now." and she got very angry
  and started arguing with me that it''s not her fault that I have expensive taste.
  I told her to leave, now, and not to come back unless she has EQUAL. QUALITY. FABRIC.


  Of course I''m being told what an awful, evil person I am because I wouldn''t "graciously"
  accept her insult of shit quality quilting cotton. For those who don''t know fabric,
  this was like presenting someone with a 2001 Honda Civic after crashing their 2020
  Maserati.


  AITA?


  **EDITED AT THE REQUEST OF A POSTER:**  To be very clear, SIL had to go *far* out
  of her way from where I directed her to grab the fabric. It was not even kept in
  the same room, let alone closet, as the tablecloths which were CLEARLY marked. There
  was no reason for her to be IN the fabric closet. The was not an "honest mistake"
  by ANY stretch of the phrase. When we were on the phone, I directed her SPECIFICALLY
  to the linen closet. She had to DELIBERATELY go OUT OF HER WAY to grab the fabric.


  **SECOND EDIT:**  The linen closet is next to one of the bathrooms, where I directed
  her. Each shelf is labeled with what they''re for, towels, guest towels, bed, guest
  bed, etc. I said "You see the shelf marked tablecloths? There''s one with paint
  on it. You can use that." The fabric closet is in the master bedroom (NOT the craft
  room even), and each larger cut of fabric is kept inside of a plastic tub, often
  times in a vacuuum sealed bag, labeled with the yardage, manufacturer, and fiber
  content.


  **THIRD EDIT:** Several people seem to have a personal issue with my writing style,
  use of caps, explanation of my large hobby room, etc! These aren''t part of the
  issue, but seem to really upset some of you. I find that very interesting and wonder
  if it would be the same if it was a man describing his video game dungeon and battle
  station! I take a lot of pride in coming from a working class background and having
  a room dedicated to my hobbies. I hope you all get to enjoy a space of your own
  eventually as well. <3'

  DESTROYED with EQUAL fabric?
