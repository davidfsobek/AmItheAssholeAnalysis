selftext: "Posting from a throwaway account. \nMe (31 F) & kids (2 F, 4 M) moved with\
  \ my husband  (31 M) from where we met, married & had our children in California\
  \ to Texas. We always said we would raise our kids in small town Texas where my\
  \ husband grew up. It was his dream & I was happy to support him!\nWhen we moved\
  \ \u2013 to a house a few blocks away from his parents \u2013 we thought we would\
  \ be getting some help from his parents with the kids. They babysat the oldest twice\
  \ in 8 months. They showed very little interest in the kids but had my husband over\
  \ multiple times a week doing things for them (they are in their 60s & in good health)\
  \ & did come over to dinner a few times. He adored his parents & they adored him.\
  \ Their only child. Their golden boy. \n\nMy husband was diagnosed with a rare cancer\
  \ that was terminal earlier in the year. He died within 5 weeks of diagnosis. It\
  \ was tragic & I am still in shock. When he was dying he was in a great deal of\
  \ pain & on morphine & wasn\u2019t always coherent or thinking straight. However\
  \ he told me his parents were devastated I would move the kids back to where I grew\
  \ up in Canada & they wouldn\u2019t be able to watch the kids grow up. Well\u2026\
  that was my exact plan. My parents are the most amazing grandparents & help my sister\
  \ out a lot (2 days a week of full babysitting!) & would do the same for me. Canada\
  \ has a great education & healthcare system & my siblings & parents are live near\
  \ each other so the kids and I would have a support network.\n\nI lied to my husband.\
  \ I told him I would stay & raise the kids as Texans as we had planned. He was in\
  \ so much pain & distress & I couldn\u2019t add to it. I chose the easy way out.\n\
  \n2 weeks after the funeral I moved my sweet babies home to Canada. My parents in\
  \ law are now telling everyone I betrayed a dying man\u2019s last wish. I have told\
  \ them we will visit every year & they are welcome to visit us in Canada whenever\
  \ they wish. They don\u2019t care \u2013 they said I have broken their family.\n\
  \nAITA for lying to my dying husband & breaking up his family?"
