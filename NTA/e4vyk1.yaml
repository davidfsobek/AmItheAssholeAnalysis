  \ her choice as a character to play. \n\nI then said I feel like she\u2019s Peach\
  \ on the outside but Waluigi in the inside. She always does the WAAAAAH like all\
  \ the time so I just ran with it. She asked me to elaborate and I said she has \u2018\
  Waluigi Energy\u2019 and now she\u2019s kind of mad at me. \n\nAITA?"
