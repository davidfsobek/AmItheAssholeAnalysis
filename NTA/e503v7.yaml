selftext: "Yesterday, a package arrived at my family\u2019s house (typically where\
  \ I send packages to instead of my apartment for security reasons). It turned out\
  \ to have arrived in the original packaging, not an unmarked box as I was hoping.\
  \ The gift was a fairly decent pressure washer. I bought it for my father seeing\
  \ as how he kept borrowing pressure washers from friends to use around the house\
  \ and I figured he\u2019d enjoy having one of his own. \n\nNow I\u2019m being labeled\
  \ as an asshole by family members because for the past few years it appears that\
  \ I\u2019ve only gotten him \u201Chouse gifts\u201D or gifts that are used around\
  \ the house (smart speaker, WiFi enabled thermostat, shop vacuum, mechanic creeper,\
  \ etc). I bought these for their functionality, the fact that he will use them fairly\
  \ often, and they all seemed like nice gestures. \n\nHe\u2019s a DIY\u2019er, likes\
  \ to get his hands dirty, and things like that. Always has some project on his mind.\
  \ AITA for not buying more sentimental gifts?"
