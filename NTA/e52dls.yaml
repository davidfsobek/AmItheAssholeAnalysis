selftext: 'I used to visit my dad most weekends and all of summer.


  He recently got remarried to someone I actually have a decent relationship with.
  I also have two stepbrothers who are younger and who I don''t really interact with.


  My dad has a four bedroom house. So all the kids have a bedroom.


  When I went to visit last month, I was "surprised" with a renovated room. And by
  renovated I mean it was converted to an office with a couch that pulls out to a
  bed. It did look nice I suppose.


  Apparently my stepmother works from home and needed an office.


  I didn''t cry or throw a tantrum. I slept in the room that weekend and have refused
  to stay the night since.


  I was really hurt and felt like I didn''t matter. My mom tried to convince me to
  go back but gave up after I told her I was old enough to decide.


  My dad is stressing out and has apologized and said he''ll change the room back
  but honestly, I''m done. This was the final thing that sealed the deal for me. I
  told him that as well. I told him I''ll come for day visits and we can have dinners
  but I won''t be staying overnight anymore.


  Was I the asshole? He did cry and I feel really shitty about it.


  Edit: I''m going to be 15 in a few months'
