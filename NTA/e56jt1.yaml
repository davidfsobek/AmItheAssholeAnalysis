selftext: "My mom and stepdad came crying to me (25f) last night that their checking\
  \ account has been drained by my little sister (12f). \n\nShe saved their debit\
  \ card info to her iPad and purchased over $3k worth of in-app purchases and toys\
  \ / clothes. \n\nThey are having a tough time financially right now and this is\
  \ a huge blow to them. They are also in some major medical debt. \n\nMy mom asked\
  \ if I could set up a gofundme page and post it to fb so family can donate to help\
  \ them out, in lieu of any Christmas presents this year for them and my sister.\
  \ I made it clear I will not be doing that and in fact promptly made a Facebook\
  \ post to warn all our friends and family to not give my parents a dime. \n\nWhy?\
  \ This is the FORTH time my sister has done this. \n\nWhen she was 9, she used my\
  \ stepdads credit card and maxed it out on some shopping animal game. They locked\
  \ away the family computers but gave her an iPad for Christmas only 3 months later.\
  \ \n\nImmediately used my brothers (27m) Apple ID and the card he had saved to buy\
  \ some more Apple store crap, totaling $300. iPad wasn\u2019t taken away but they\
  \ removed all internet access. \n\nA year later when she was 10, she was given back\
  \ internet access and stole my aunts card information, saved it, and did it again.\
  \ Bought more toys and other things that couldn\u2019t be returned, like movies\
  \ on vudu and signed up for Netflix and Hulu with it. iPad was taken away, she did\
  \ some chores and batted her eyelashes and was forgiven and given back the iPad\
  \ after 6 weeks. \n\nI made the post after our phone call and My mom sobbed on the\
  \ phone to me after she saw it later on to please take the post down and tell everyone\
  \ I was exaggerating, and to donate to help them. They are in a very bad way, I\
  \ get that, but it\u2019s no ones fault but their own. \n\nMy brother and boyfriend\
  \ agree with me but think I shouldn\u2019t have made the post on fb and are mad\
  \ that I\u2019ve prevented them from getting money from any relatives to help them\
  \ out. No one is talking to me right now and apparently they are already over 2\
  \ months behind on their mortgage and 1 car payment. My brother says it\u2019s not\
  \ my job to give tough love to our mother, we should be supporting them. I can\u2019\
  t get past how stupid they have been with my sister. \n\nSo, Reddit, am I the asshole\
  \ for telling everyone the whole story and preventing them from getting any help?"

  who had over $3k stolen from them?
