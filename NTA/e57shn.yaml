selftext: "My Husband and I (30F/34M) bought our house 6 years ago, right around the\
  \ time we purchased it, my BIL (32M) decided to go back to school full time. Our\
  \ House has 4 bedrooms, and at the time I was pregnant with our second child. We\
  \ had the spare room in our basement, so we invited my BIL to move in with us while\
  \ he went back to school. He doesn't pay rent, but he does help pay for utilities\
  \ and food.\n\nFast forward to now, my brother in law has just graduated, and will\
  \ be moving out in February, we also have our 3rd child who is 6 months old. \n\n\
  My sister (32F) lives with my mom and step dad, she has moved out a few times but\
  \ always ends up moving back home, as she has a borderline personality disorder\
  \ with depression. Her and my mom fight regularly (and I mean explosive) about pretty\
  \ much everything. She doesn't pay rent,and struggles to work full time hours. She\
  \ hates living at home with my mom, but without being able to work, there's not\
  \ much else she could do.\n\nMy husband and I were at my mom's and  mentioned that\
  \ my BIL was moving  out in a few months, and how it will be nice for my kids to\
  \ have their own rooms (baby is in our room right now and our oldest son can have\
  \ the room in the basement) and how we can can do more with renovations now that\
  \ we don't have to worry about it  being an inconvenience to someone else (our basement\
  \ really needs some work done) \n\nWell, no soon after we left, my sister called\
  \ me stating that it was a perfect situation as she is miserable at home and she\
  \ could move in with me. I was taken back from her statement as it really was sudden\
  \ and out of nowhere, she then began to tell me how detrimental to her mental health\
  \  living with my mom is, and how  miserable she is. \n\nNow, my sister does see\
  \ a psychiatrist (has done so for many years) and nearly all the blow outs between\
  \ her and my mom are started by her, sometimes it's like my mom just breaths and\
  \ my sister is yelling at her, and while I do agree she needs to move out for both\
  \ their sakes, I don't want it to be in with me.\n\nFor one, I want to finally be\
  \ able to just be home alone with my family, for my kids to have their own spaces\
  \ and (as horrible as this might sound) I don't want to be the one responsible for\
  \ her mental state. She has blow outs with everyone ( just not to the the extent\
  \ she has with my mom)  and I just don't want the life she has with my mom to become\
  \ mine and my families life, especially with 3 young kids. Not to mention the fact\
  \ that she doesn't drive or really work, so I have no idea how she would get around\
  \ or pay for anything.....\n\nI plan on calling her back to tell her I don't want\
  \ her living with me (obviously more kinder and better worded then that) but AITA\
  \ for it?\n\nEdit: So, I told her tonight that she couldn't move in with me, it\
  \ led to her crying and saying she doesn't know what else to do, that she could\
  \ of handled waiting the next few months at my mom's house as she would feel better\
  \ knowing she was \"escaping\" eventually, but that the thought of her staying there\
  \ makes her want to kill herself (something we have dealt with a handful of times\
  \ before, not actual actions, just \"thoughts\", she has been in and out of the\
  \ hospital for this) \n\nI told her if she really wanted things to change, she has\
  \ to take the right steps, talk to her therapist about assistant living, maybe her\
  \ and my mom could go to therapy together? But that living with me wasn't a solution\
  \  or an option nor would it help her. She got defensive at those suggestions and\
  \ said it was easy for me to think those were options when I clearly don't understand\
  \ what she's going through, said I care more about my husband's family then her\
  \ and then hung up on me."
