selftext: "Yeah, pretty exhausting title, couldn't think of a more concise way of\
  \ summarizing my situation.\n\nMe and my boyfriend have been in a committed relationship\
  \ for about two years now. For the last 9 months, however, he's been pretty much\
  \ on the other side of the country for work. It's been tough, but we are most definitely\
  \ still incredibly dedicated to one another. \n\nMeanwhile, I've been working at\
  \ this place for about 7 months, and almost from the start, this guy named Derek\
  \ has been harassing me. It started out with innocent comments, and eventually progressed\
  \ to what I can only describe as borderline verbal sexual harassment. Throughout\
  \ all this, I have stated repeatedly that I have a boyfriend, I'm not interested,\
  \ etc., but the guy literally cannot take a hint. He usually replies with crap like\
  \ \"I don't see no ring on your finger,\" or \"When's the last time I've seen you\
  \ at a party not alone?\" (Our workplace holds these cookout esque parties that\
  \ most coworkers like to bring their SO's or children to.) \n\nI've brought the\
  \ situation to HR about three times now. He just gets a warning, and then goes back\
  \ to harassing me in a few days. I've even requested to be moved to another floor,\
  \ which has been denied. At this point, the lady working the desk has literally\
  \ just told me to \"ignore it\".\n\nSo, this weekend while venting to my sister,\
  \ she suggested that I just wear an engagement ring to work from now on, to show\
  \ that I'm absolutely, 100% taken. I don't know if this would work, but it's worth\
  \ a shot to me: my sister owns an Etsy jewelry store and can easily lend me one\
  \ of her rings. However, when I broached this idea to my boyfriend, he was completely\
  \ against it, saying that it was disrespectful to him when we aren't actually engaged.\
  \ \n\nWIBTA?\n\nEdit/Update:\nThe situation has mostly been resolved for the most\
  \ part. I apologize for not replying to any comments; since this was a throwaway\
  \ account I just looked at the first twenty or so replies and stopped after.\n\n\
  To the people saying my boyfriend seems like a bad boyfriend: I apologize for not\
  \ being more clear. I typed this all out after our call when he refused to give\
  \ me permission to wear the ring. My boyfriend does care about my wellbeing, and\
  \ from what I can tell completely hates Derek\u2019s guts, but he doesn\u2019t think\
  \ that the ring would be appropriate considering the attention it would garner should\
  \ people start asking questions, which is what he meant when he said it would be\
  \ \u201Cdisrespectful\u201D.\n\nTo the people saying that this isn\u2019t a viable\
  \ solution and that I should report to either a higher up or get a lawyer: you\u2019\
  re absolutely right. I previously did not want to seek further action because I\
  \ felt frustrated and spent with my HR, but after reading through all the responses\
  \ I realize now that Derek is honestly much, much worse than \u201Cjust a creep\u201D\
  , and that I should be reporting my HR\u2019s incompetence regardless. Special thank\
  \ you to user u/phillybride\n\nThank you for all the replies; I haven\u2019t read\
  \ through them all but I do appreciate every bit of input."
