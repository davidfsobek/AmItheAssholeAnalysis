selftext: "My daughter is currently in university.\n\nShes always been super independent,\
  \ so she has wanted  to live by herself since she was 16.\n\nWhen my daughter was\
  \ 1, I had  been dating her mother for 7 months.\n\nMy wife  didn't have a custody\
  \ arrangement set up with my daughters father.\n\nOne day when he came to visit\
  \ he just didn't return home with my daughter, we tried to get the police involved\
  \ but because she wasnt in immediate danger and he was on the birth certificate\
  \ or whatever BS they gave us.\n\nI spent the whole night driving searching for\
  \ where he could possibly be since he refused to tell us, I did that every day for\
  \ weeks.\n\nWe eventually had to go court which took weeks, my wife was devastated.\n\
  \nWe got my daughter back after 2 months of no communication.\n\nMy daughter hasn't\
  \ seen her dad in 7 years.\n\nWhen my daughter  was old enough we told her what\
  \ he put her mother through, my wife has never fully healed and doesn't let our\
  \ baby out of her sight for a second.\n\nMy daughter recently told us she was meeting\
  \ up with her father.\n\nShe cut off texting and phoning her mother and her mother\
  \ is worried sick, she wont eat and cant sleep.\n\nI've told my daughter I wont\
  \ pay for her rent if she cant even have the decency to talk to her mother \n\n\
  I've since been getting spammed by my daughter calling me an AH for pulling a power\
  \ play, threatening to drop out of university.\n\nI've told her the terms of the\
  \ agreement are to talk to her mother once a month, at minimum.\n\nI dont want to\
  \ hear about her dad either, I may not be her father biologically but what he did\
  \ had an impact on me too.\n\nI also told her if she stops communicating for longer\
  \ than 2 weeks we will worry since when we got her back from her fathers she was\
  \ covered in bruises \"rough play\" her father explained them away as, he got away\
  \ with that too.\n\nAITA?\n\nThrow away"
