selftext: "My mom (mid 40s), takes pride in her look and style, this weekend sent\
  \ my fianc\xE9 a picture of the dress she bought for our wedding, which is in 9\
  \ months. I could see that my fianc\xE9 wasn\u2019t reacting well when my mom called\
  \ her for thoughts. My fianc\xE9, being respectful mentioned that the style (deep\
  \ V and flowy) and colors (blue and splashes of beige that looks close to white)\
  \ were a concern because it could be similar to her wedding dress. Talking to my\
  \ fianc\xE9 after their call, she asked me if I could ask my mom to get a new dress.\
  \ \n\nAs a preface, my mom is an intense and demanding person, we are Polish, and\
  \ she escalates things quickly, but I thought that when I called and asked her she\u2019\
  d be upset,  but still understanding. \n\nI called her yesterday and asked her how\
  \ everything was going, how I saw the dress and thought it was beautiful but had\
  \ some concerns with it: namely the style and part of the color scheme being very\
  \ close to white. In the most calm manner I explained that I don\u2019t want my\
  \ fianc\xE9 to feel upstaged or not the center of attention on her wedding day and\
  \ I\u2019m worried that could happen at the wedding if my mom wore this particular\
  \ dress. Silence on her end... until a bomb dropped. \n\nShe went off on me saying\
  \ that she can\u2019t believe that I\u2019d ask her to get a new dress, and that\
  \ I shouldn\u2019t worry about my fianc\xE9\u2019s \u201Cinsecurities and grow the\
  \ fuck up\u201D. Being calm, I explained to her that this is my and my fianc\xE9\
  \u2019s wedding day and that it\u2019s important that my future wife feels most\
  \ special. My mom went to state that this day is special for her too and she will\
  \ wear what she wants, final. I explained while this is a special day for everybody,\
  \ it\u2019s particularly MY and MY fianc\xE9\u2019s wedding and I\u2019d feel much\
  \ more comfortable if my mom could just get a new style/color dress. She continued\
  \ to go off, now throwing insults at me, talking shit about my fianc\xE9 and her\
  \ family, and saying that she won\u2019t be a part of my \u201Chillbilly\u201D wedding\
  \ (we are all from Chicago) if she can\u2019t wear what she wants and that it won\u2019\
  t be dictated to her what to wear. She also claimed that my fianc\xE9 and I always\
  \ have problems, and that our wedding planning has been a disaster. I have no idea\
  \ where this came from because everything has always been smooth on our end, and\
  \ we are mostly self funding the wedding and not relying on my mom for anything.\n\
  \nI then started to get frustrated and told her to watch what she is saying because\
  \ she can ruin relationships for good, and that if she doesn\u2019t want to be a\
  \ part of my wedding because of this, to say it now and we can make that happen.\
  \ Our conversation ended in screaming back and forth as I had had it with the insults\
  \ and unwillingness to be flexible. Now my family birthday dinner and holidays are\
  \ ruined unless she apologizes. Knowing her, she won\u2019t. \n\nAITA for asking\
  \ my mom to get a new dress for my wedding that is 9 months away?\n\nDress in question:\
