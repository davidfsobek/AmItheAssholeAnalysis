selftext: "My cousin Mandy is pregnant. She and her parents came for dinner yesterday\
  \ with my parents and I was invited too.\n\nI'll be straight: I don't like Mandy.\
  \ At all. She was always the favourite growing up. I was told by grandparents, extended\
  \ family and even my own parents at times that Mandy was prettier and smarter than\
  \ me and that I should be more like her. She was pretty and girly and I wasn't.\
  \ She got good grades and went to university which I didn't. I have a decent job\
  \ and my own apartment. She has a six figure job and a nice house with her BF. They've\
  \ never said it but I know my parents think I'm a failure compared to her. She knew\
  \ she was the favourite and used to call me a freak, and got all my cousins to gang\
  \ up on me and exclude me. \n\nBeing pregnant hasn't made her any nicer. She made\
  \ a few comments over dinner about how I'm bigger than her even though she's pregnant.\
  \ She said that she's sure her baby will have achieved more than me by the time\
  \ it's 5. All I could say in response was that I didn't want anything to do with\
  \ her spawn because she'd raise it to be a snobby brat just like her. \n\nThing\
  \ is, Mandy's bf is mixed race (half black/white) so her baby will be mixed race\
  \ too (3/4 white 1/4 black). I've never met the guy but I've seen a couple pictures\
  \ on facebook. Mandy and her parents got really offended that I referred to a mixed\
  \ race child as ''spawn''. Mandy ran out in tears and they called me a racist. \n\
  \nI'm sorry but I didn't intend that in a racist way. As I said I've never met her\
  \ bf, and didn't have him or the child's race in mind when I made the comment. I\
  \ don't want anything to do with any spawn of such an awful woman whether they are\
  \ white or anything else. It wasn't a racist comment. It was a comment about what\
  \ a vile person she is and what a terrible mother she'll be."
