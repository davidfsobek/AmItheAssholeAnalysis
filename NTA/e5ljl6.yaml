selftext: "I (19f) and my boyfriend (19m) have been together for 3 years. Where I\
  \ live, you are legally an adult at 18 and can do everything on your own at this\
  \ point. His mother has always been overbearing and mothers him quite a lot. \n\n\
  My boyfriend's birthday is in early December, then there's Christmas, and our anniversary\
  \ is in early January. Of course, then there's Valentine's Day only a couple of\
  \ months later. Instead of buying him four sets of presents (which would be impossible\
  \ because men are already hard to buy for) I thought I could do something that combines\
  \ all four events and book for us to go to Rome for a few days next summer. My boyfriend\
  \ and I both work, so this gives us plenty of time to save and I thought it would\
  \ be the perfect present, instead of just buying socks and aftershave again. \n\n\
  So, I buy the tickets for June next year, and put them in an envelope. His birthday\
  \ was yesterday, and he was over the moon when he saw the tickets. My boyfriend\
  \ has never travelled out of the country before and does not have a passport because\
  \ his mother is terrified of flying, so they never did. I told him I would pay for\
  \ him to get the passport so all he would have to accumulate is spending money.\
  \ \n\nWhen my bf told his mom about the present, she acted happy and then took me\
  \ aside while bf was talking to his family. She asked me why I thought it was appropriate\
  \ to do this without asking her, with her reasons for it being inappropriate being:\
  \ \n\n* He lives at home with his parents so they have the right to know where he\
  \ is. \n* He might be 'needed at home' during those days. \n* She is terrified of\
  \ flying and I should have cleared it with her that her anxiety would be able to\
  \ cope with it. \n\nThis made me super angry, because her anxiety has affected my\
  \ boyfriend so many times and it's not fair. I told her almost ver batim \"If you're\
  \ so anxious about him flying, you have seven months to go to therapy and try to\
  \ change that. You have seven months to make arrangements for if you need some help.\
  \ You have seven months to grow up and let your son be an adult for once.\" and\
  \ then I left. I told my bf what happened, and he agreed with me but said I could\
  \ have maybe been more polite because MIL is just anxious and not vindictive. MIL\
  \ is no longer talking to me. \n\nAITA?"

  beforehand, and shouting at her when she was upset about it?
