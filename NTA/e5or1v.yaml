selftext: "\nmobile sorry and my sister is 4. \n\nToday I unfortunately woke up late\
  \ at 730 and I was willing to take my sister a bit late to school (we ride the bus).\
  \ I head into the shower and hop out at around 8. I start getting dressed and I\u2019\
  m just about ready I just needed to find my shoes. I go out and look for my sister\
  \ so we can both put on my shoes. I start looking around in the living room, my\
  \ mom\u2019s room, and even the room I changed in. The only person there was my\
  \ nana. I didn\u2019t think much of it and just left thinking my mom took her school.\
  \ \n\nI get to school at 915 my class starts at 930. I am in my class early so I\
  \ can do an important project that was due today. I\u2019m in class and I get a\
  \ text from my mom at 918 asking if I had my sister almost at school.\n\nI call\
  \ her cause this was about to be a big problem and I couldn\u2019t just text her\
  \ that I didn\u2019t have my sister. So I\u2019m calling her and she picks up asking\
  \ me what\u2019s up. I tell her I don\u2019t have my sister and I never did. I told\
  \ her that when I got out the shower no one was there but nana. Now she was upset\
  \ with me. She said that she was my responsibility in the mornings. I told her that\
  \ how can I know where she\u2019s at while I\u2019m in the shower. How can I possibly\
  \ know the whereabouts of everyone in the house while in the shower. I tell her\
  \ I thought she took my sister to school and she says no.\n\nShe asks where I\u2019\
  m at and I tell her I\u2019m at school. She tells me that I needed to head home\
  \ and find my sister . I tell her I can\u2019t do that cause I have a project due\
  \ for that class and I\u2019ll lose points on it. She then says that my sister should\
  \ be my one priority and that it doesn\u2019t matter. \n\nSo I get up and leave.\
  \ I start heading to the bus stop and call my nana cause she was still home,  her\
  \ and ask if my sister was still home she says no. I start listing off all the places\
  \ I looked before I left she says she\u2019s not home. She starts getting worried\
  \ and I tell her my sister is missing. So now she\u2019s making a fuss. \n\n\nShe\
  \ hangs up telling me my mom is calling to I start dialing my little brother who\
  \ would be the last person who saw her before the house got empty. He tells me that\
  \ she was laying down asleep in mom\u2019s bed and I tell him no one was in mom\u2019\
  s room. He tells me ok and I tell him I\u2019m going to go find her. I hang up and\
  \ get ready to call the police when my mom sent a \u201Ccall me NOW\u201D text.\n\
  \nI call my mom again and ask what\u2019s going on. She tells me that my sister\
  \ is at school and that she took her this morning. I tell her that she just wasted\
  \ my time and I was about to call the cops. I tell I missed an important end of\
  \ semester assignment and that I worried my brother and my nana. \n\nShe said it\
  \ was my fault because I should\u2019ve known where my sister was at and that I\
  \ need to learn how to take responsibility better. I was so pissed. I told her she\
  \ was being ridiculous and obnoxious and that because of her little test I failed\
  \ a class.\n\nAITA for not knowing where my sister was?"
