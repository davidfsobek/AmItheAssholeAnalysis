selftext: "Kind of a long story, but I was talking to a different co-worker, Misty,\
  \ about housing. Misty asked me where I live. I gave her a very very vague description.\n\
  \nMy other co-worker, Cynthia, overheard me, and immediately cut in and said \"\
  Oh, you live in the ghetto\". \n\nI tried to explain to her that I don't live where\
  \ she thinks I do, and explained that I actually live in a nice residential neighborhood.\
  \ \n\nShe continued to cut me off mid-sentence about three times, saying (word for\
  \ word) \"Nope, you live in the ghetto. That's the ghetto, that's the ghetto, that's\
  \ the ghetto.\"\n\nOn top of everything, she said this all in front of about 4-5\
  \ other employees. A little bit humiliating for me, honestly. \n\nNormally I wouldn't\
  \ care or would brush it off, but a couple things;\n1) we have multiple employees\
  \ that actually DO openly live in low income housing in less than desirable neighborhoods.\n\
  2) the word \"ghetto\", to me, has pretty racist connotations. So to use that towards\
  \ anyone is pretty bold, imo.\n\nThe kicker is that this employee is on her final\
  \ warning before termination, for past behavioral/attitude issues. So if I report\
  \ her, there's a good chance there will be big repercussions for her.\n\nWIBTA if\
  \ I reported this to HR?"
