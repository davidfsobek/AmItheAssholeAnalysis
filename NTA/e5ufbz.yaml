selftext: "Ok, so the title may not make any sense.\n\nI work in a beauty supply store,\
  \ if you have a license in any beauty profession we give you a very nice discount.\
  \ \nWe have upgraded to a new system and it turns out a lot of women who come in\
  \ and have the discount DONT have any licenses at all, we figured this out because\
  \ now we\u2019re able to see the license numbers every time they check out so every\
  \ time we get a customer who\u2019s license number isn\u2019t real I deleted and\
  \ I take away the discount so next time they come around they don\u2019t get the\
  \ discount for their products.(I am unable to delete it beforehand because the computer\
  \ takes forever to delete and update profiles).\n\nI was talking to one of the women\
  \ who\u2019s been at this specific store for a while and I said that I was finding\
  \ a lot of fake license numbers and she said \u201Cyeah, the last manager (who left\
  \ the store) if she liked the customer she would set them up with a fake license\
  \ # so they can get the discount\u201D and I said well that\u2019s too bad because\
  \ every time I find a fake license # I erase it so next time they come back they\
  \ don\u2019t get a discount.\n\nShe got upset and said \u201Cwhat am I supposed\
  \ to say to these customers when they come back?!?\u201D \ni replied: you can tell\
  \ them we have a new system which wiped out all the licenses, please show me your\
  \ license and I will reinstate the discount! \nShe then replied I was on a \u201C\
  power trip\u201D taking the discounts away, I replied saying that I didn\u2019t\
  \ pay over 13K to get a hair dresser license for just anyone to come and get a discount\
  \ just because they were buddy buddy with the last manager, the girl just replied\
  \ \u201Cwhatever\u201D and left.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for checking everyone\u2019\
  s license or should I just let it be?"
