selftext: 'Started a new job. Was in the break room. Met one of my coworkers for the
  first time. We talked a little bit, was fine. She asked me my name so I told her,
  then I asked what her''s was and she curtly said "I''m not going to tell you that."
  I was like "That''s kind of weird but alright." And she said if I wanted to find
  out I could look at the board that said the 2 employees of the month and that hers
  was one of the names, to which I pretty frankly said "I don''t really give a shit
  what your name is enough to put in that effort, I''ll just find out from someone
  else" and then I just disengaged.


  I kind of cringe looking back. She was probably just messing around but I mean...
  I just met you and you''re being alienating like that? I don''t know if that is
  just her style of fooling around and she wasn''t trying to be a dick but at that
  point I felt slighted. :/


  AITA?'
title: AITA? Coworker refused to tell me her name. I got kind of defensive.
