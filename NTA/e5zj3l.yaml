selftext: 'We give our daughter $2,000/mo as part of a trust stipend and have been
  since she was 18. She''s 21 now and in school (the trust was originally for school
  related expenses, incl. rent, food, etc). It''s meant to make her school life as
  stress free as we can afford: she doesn''t need to work but still can if she wants
  for extra money. She chooses not to work and instead live off this stipend.


  The first year went alright. She picked out a room in a complex for $350/mo and
  budgeted pretty well for someone who just began living on her own. The second year
  did not, however. She was evicted within the first five months of her 10 month lease
  and had to drop out of school that year to move back home. She simply didn''t budget
  things well and went into arrears two months back-to-back. We weren''t informed
  of this and only learned of it in the middle of the eviction process.


  We don''t have access to her bank accounts, she''s independent, so we don''t know
  how that situation occurred. We tried again this year and now it''s December and
  she''s having money issues again. She said she might have to leave school before
  the second semester begins due to money issues.


  She''s home for the holidays now so we sat down and had an open conversation. We
  learned she''s spending $1,000/mo eating out every day and close to $700/mo on videogames.
  No wonder she''s in trouble because her rent now is $400 and her phone bill $70.


  My husband and I want to put rules on this money now. We want to take that $2,000
  and have direct payment from our bank to her landlord for her rent, from our bank
  to her phone bill, then dispense $200/wk. The remainder she can request on a case
  by case basis. Want to eat out? Phone us and we''ll order Skip Dishes for you. Any
  extra per month we''ll give her up front. It''s confusing to type out but she doesn''t
  lose money, it''s just staggered and mandatory payments we handle on her behalf.


  I don''t want to be /r/insaneparents and I think it''s reasonable. Would we be the
  asshole?'
