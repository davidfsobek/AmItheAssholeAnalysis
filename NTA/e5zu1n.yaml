selftext: 'Long story short, every year I take my staff (about ten people) out to
  this very nice Italian restaurant that everyone in my office absolutely loves. Its
  a highlight of our December as an office and everyone always looks forward to it.
  We have been doing it there consistently for about 7-10 years I would say. People
  have been asking when the lunch party will be in anticipation of it.


  I just made the reservation on Monday to have lunch there in a couple weeks. I also
  just hired a new staff member about a month ago. I sent out the email this morning
  letting everyone now the date and time I booked the lunch. I received in reply from
  most my staff that they are excited and looking forward to it. The new staff member,
  however, also just emailed asking if there were any Plant-based food options there.
  I am not really sure if they do, but sent her the menu and said if we need to choose
  another place that accommodates that, we can. Then she just told me that not only
  does she only eat plant-based food, but also cannot eat in a place that serves pork
  at all (first time I am made aware she has any food restrictions at all). Maybe
  I am being very ignorant, but I am not sure thee are too many places in my area
  that serves zero pork. Now I don''t want to be rude to this staff member and make
  her feel left out, especially because she is new, which is why I have no problem
  finding an alternative that serves plant-based food, but I am feeling conflicted
  about finding a place that serves primarily plant based options and no pork. Everyone
  else in my office eats the standard american diet with little restrictions (Think
  high fat and high carb content lol). I already know with some of my more porkster
  (pun intended) employees will be upset about this and probably bitch. But I don''t
  want to leave this one staff member out, but also feel bad prioritizing her food
  restrictions over everyone else''s preferences. I am going to see if I can find
  a place with plant based food options and no pork served there, but if I can''t
  find one that most people would be okay with, WIBTA if I kept the reservation at
  the current place (I know for a fact it serves pork so this would not work for the
  new staff member). I can see a couple of my employees not wanting to go or refusing
  to go to a plant-based no pork restaurant because they would not like anything there.
  So do I prioritize the new member of my staff over the others or essentially prioritize
  the older staff members over the new one?

  Edit: To clear up some confusion, she in general is a nice lady and is seeming to
  be doing well in her position. She did not demand anything, and even said if it
  ends up being at a place that cooks pork, then she wouldn''t come. The difficulty
  with that, is I dont want to alienate her or make her feel bad especially because
  she is new and is will likely do good work for us, which is really hard to come
  by.  If she did not come, she would be the only one in the office for like 2/2.5
  hours while everyone is having fun at lunch. I would offer her to go home for that
  time period but she lives like 45 min to an hour away with snow conditions so that
  wouldn''t make sense for her. Hence my current dilemma.


  Edit#2: A lot of people are asking similar questions so I figured an update would
  be easier. Anyways, I spoke with her again and broke everything down. I tried to
  flesh out the pork thing but, without her being mean or rude, she essentially just
  left it as a religious thing and would not go into more detail, and I did not want
  to press more. So I told her it was important to me she felt included and a part
  of the team. I told her to find me some alternatives by the end of the week so I
  can at least explore those, and see about getting a plate brought to the restaurant.
  May explore a gift card idea if that does not work.


  Thank you to those who actually have compassion and understanding that not everyone
  is the same and some people have religious/allergy restrictions. Also, a lot of
  you need to work on your reading comprehension. A lot of the comments make it seem
  like the first two sentences were read and that''s it.


  Edit#3: Apparently this still needs to be clarified. She has the issue with pork
  because of her religion. Its not "I don''t like pork, thus no one can have it either."
  Its more like "my religion does not allow pork to be cross contaminated with other
  foods items, so if pork is cooked in the kitchen I cannot eat there." Also she has
  expressed she has no problem with just not going and understands that her restrictions
  make things difficult.'
