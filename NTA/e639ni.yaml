selftext: "Throw away because some of my friends know my reddit account and I want\
  \ to keep this as private as possible. Sorry if the answer seems obvious, but I've\
  \ had so much backlash Im starting to question myself.\n\nI am f25, my brother is\
  \ m22. He lives with me since he moved out of our parents house, reasons are irrelevant.\
  \ I came home to find him with his buddies in my home, getting wasted. I was pissed\
  \ because he never asked if he could have people over (\"Im an adult OP, I can do\
  \ what I want\"). Apparently he and his friends were throwing a \"bullet dodged\"\
  \ party. \n\nHe had been seeing this girl for a bit. She texted him letting him\
  \ know that she was pregnant, but planning to abort the baby. She asked if he could\
  \ financially help her pay for the operation. He. Blocked. Her. I was *horrified*.\
  \ Apparently he and his brilliant friends decided that she had lied about taking\
  \ birth control, because \"Its impossible for women to get pregnant if they're on\
  \ the pill.\" \u2026.. right. \n\nI was livid. I was completely disgusted not only\
  \ by their ignorance towards birth control and safe sex, but by the fact that he\
  \ would block a girl and leave her completely on her own to handle a problem that\
  \ he was at least 50% responsible for. I told him, in these exact words \"pack your\
  \ shit and get the fuck out\" Obviously more than this has happened in the past,\
  \ but this was my breaking point. I had tried so hard to bend over backwards for\
  \ my baby brother. House him when he was homeless, help him get a job, give him\
  \ rides... only for him to turn out like *that*? Nope. So anyways, he and his friends\
  \ stood there like they didn't think I was serious. I said again, \"all of you get\
  \ the fuck out. I don't want to see any of you here again.\"\n\nHere's where I'm\
  \ possibly the asshole. I told him in no uncertain terms that he needed to collect\
  \ his things and leave. If he was old enough to make big-boy decisions, he was old\
  \ enough to find a place on his own. He straight up said no. So I lost my temper.\
  \ I grabbed as much of his stuff as I could, crammed it into a suitcase, and put/threw\
  \ the suitcase outside. I shouted that if he didn't leave I would call the police.\
  \ Fast forward tears and begging, he was finally out. That night I got *several*\
  \ messages that I was heartless for making him homeless. They pregnancy wasn't his\
  \ fault because: 1) it was an accident. 2) they weren't a serious couple so he has\
  \ no reason to help her. 3) she should have been more careful. I called bull, and\
  \ said I would never allow someone with that sick mindset live under my roof. I\
  \ said that he is not my brother and I don't want anything to do with him. My parents,\
  \ my aunts, and some cousins are with me, but that leaves about 3/4 of the family\
  \ against me. They think that I should support him because he is my brother, I should\
  \ have given him time (he's not on the lease btw, and he was *supposed* to pay rent\
  \ but often didn't), and the punishment just didn't fit the crime.\n\nso reddit,\
  \ am I the asshole?\n\nEDIT: so I didn\u2019t think this would get as much traction.\
  \ I\u2019ve already seen some comments about it, and gotten some PMs, so Im gonna\
  \ address this now. I only posted this to find out if I was TA for *how I handled\
  \ it*. If I am TA, fine. So be it. But I don\u2019t care what your views on abortion\
  \ are, or how you don\u2019t think he\u2019s responsible for her pregnancy. So please\
  \ do not comment if you\u2019re just going to tell me about how abortion is sinful.\n\
  \nEDIT 2: I cam currently trying to track the girl down. She is an old work colleague\
  \ of his, and Im trying to find his old coworkers to figure out her contact info\
  \ and see if I can help in any way."
