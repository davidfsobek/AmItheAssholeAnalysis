  \ I opened the door, and I see her in just a bra and pants. She was surprised. I\
  \ payed her for today, and told her that she wouldn't be babysitting our kids anymore.\n\
  \ \nShe then posted on NextDoor that I fired her for her clothing. That is true,\
  \ but I feel like that's an overexageration. I just called her out on what really\

  So, AITA?"
