selftext: 'So, not long ago, a friend of mine and his girlfriend needed a place to
  stay. I invited them to rent a room in my home, they quickly agreed, we moved forward,
  it''s been mostly good. I work from home, so this is my home and my office, but
  I''ve been trying to respect that they live here too and this can be used as their
  living space. That said, their friends and families spend a LOT of time here, and
  it''s been kind of a nuisance.


  Fast forward a while, and my friend comes to me and says his girlfriend is pregnant,
  and they''re planning on keeping and raising this child... Here. In my home. Now,
  we don''t have any kind of lease, or rental agreement, or anything formal like that,
  this was just an invitation for them to come and stay in my home since they needed
  a cheap place to live. I did not at the time attach any kinds of conditions to that.
  I also did not sign up for having a newborn in the house, and EVEN MORE visits and
  constant help and attention from their friends and families that that would bring.


  I don''t think I''m being unreasonable not wanting that in my home, but, at the
  same time, I feel like a huge asshole saying "I don''t want a kid here, you have
  to leave" after inviting them to live here.


  So what''s the verdict? AITA here?

  Edit - Wow, didn''t actually think this would get much of a response, but thanks
  all. I really hope I''m not in for a difficult legal/eviction situation. I should
  clarify, I did not just kick them out, the baby isn''t due for a while yet, so I''m
  going to give them a few months to get organized and find a place. Fingers crossed
  that things remain civil and everyone is understanding and just leaves quietly.'
