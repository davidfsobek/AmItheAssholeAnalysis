selftext: "Around this time last year, I got back together with a boyfriend from college\
  \ for about four months. I am good friends with his sister. He and I rekindled our\
  \ young love at her wedding. Shortly after we got together, I got really sick. Through\
  \ the stress of that situation, I think we both quickly realized that we weren\u2019\
  t right for each other, but that\u2019s not why we broke up...\n\nAfter a couple\
  \ months, he started tossing around the idea of joining the military. One night\
  \ he told me that he had decided to enlist. He had already talked to a recruiting\
  \ officer. He planned to move pretty quickly with his plans. I told him that I didn\u2019\
  t want to do long distance, and he understood. I let him know that I was willing\
  \ to continue dating until he left. He told me there would be no point. So through\
  \ tear filled eyes, we kissed goodbye. \n \nAfter the breakup I would occasionally\
  \ ask him how he was doing and even wished him a happy birthday. He would never\
  \ initiate a text to me and always had very short replies. Well here we are, one\
  \ year later, and I still see him driving around town all the time. Maybe he didn\u2019\
  t lie, maybe it wasn\u2019t an excuse, but it sure seems like it was! I\u2019m a\
  \ comedian and I think this is hilarious. I recently tweeted \u201CMy ex used to\
  \ listen to Joe Rogan every day, and yet I was still surprised when he lied about\
  \ enlisting in the military to break up with me.\u201D \n\nThe tweet was a smash\
  \ hit. Lots of favorites. The only person he knows that follows me on Twitter is\
  \ his sister. AND SHE WAS FURIOUS. She sent him a screenshot of the tweet. I did\
  \ not think about the possibility that that could happen. He was pissed. His sister\
  \ confronted me about it, accused me of lying and hurting his reputation. I didn\u2019\
  t mean for this to happen. I simply hate Joe Rogan. Am I the ass hole?"
title: AITA for tweeting that my ex boyfriend lied about going into the military to
  break up with me?
