selftext: "Many years ago, I was married to man named Mark. 2 years into the marriage,\
  \ I found out he was cheating on me and got the other woman pregnant. It was a huge\
  \ blow because I too was pregnant with his child. I was only 9 weeks pregnant and\
  \ was determined to abort the child and divorce him. He begged me to reconsider,\
  \ and insisted I give our relationship a second chance, and so I did, albeit reluctantly.\
  \ \n\nI had a very unhappy pregnancy and when I was 6 months pregnant, I learned\
  \ that he never stopped seeing the other woman. He told me that he was torn and\
  \ that he was in love with both of us. I wasn't willing to tolerate any of that\
  \ bullshit, so I moved out and filed for divorce. I wanted him to disappear from\
  \ my life, but being pregnant with his child made things difficult. \n\nI never\
  \ bonded with the baby , and the baby being his offspring contributed to the negative\
  \ emotions that I felt. \n\nI told him that I didn't want this baby. So when he\
  \ got together with the other woman, I gave her the choice to adopt the baby, which\
  \ she did. With that, I officially signed over my parental rights as soon as the\
  \ girl turned 6 months old (I left the day she was born). When I left, I told Mark\
  \ that I didn't want anything to do with the girl and the other woman was free to\
  \ be her mother. \n\nI moved to another country and tried to leave that part of\
  \ my life behind. I met a wonderful man and we got married. He knew all about my\
  \ past and now we have 3 wonderful kids who are 9, 5 and 2 years old. \n\nRecently,\
  \ my ex Mark contacted me out of the blue and told me that my biological daughter,\
  \ who is 14 now, wants to meet me. Apparently, his wife had passed away and before\
  \ she died, she confessed that she wasn't her biological mother. \n\nI'm torn. I\
  \ don't want to meet this kid. It was very difficult for me to leave that part of\
  \ my life behind. I was depressed for years. I reminded him that I gave up my parental\
  \ rights years ago and that I wanted nothing to do with both of them. I planned\
  \ on telling my kids about their half sibling once they were grown and mentally\
  \ mature, not right now when they are still so little. I told him to never contact\
  \ me again and hanged up. \n\nAITA?"
