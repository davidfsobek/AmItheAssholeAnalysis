selftext: 'I have a friend who I have a class with this semester. She''s a really
  kind and beautiful person. I always thought she was the type to have a great moral
  compass. Anyway, we have the same TA that teaches a separate section for our main
  class. Right off the bat, a shit ton of people thought he was super cute and began
  to flirt with him during class. My friend, let''s call her ''Anna'', seemed especially
  uninterested and even made fun of the girls who were literally throwing themselves
  at him.


  The semester went on and even though Anna never was interested, it seemed like the
  TA himself was growing more and more fond of her. Anna was doing extremely well
  in the class and she stood out as one of the smartest students so he regularly praised
  her for her work and even wrote cute little compliments on her essays. I noticed
  that he would also try to talk to her a lot before and during class. Since Anna
  is really nice, she engaged him and they seemed to hit it off. Soon, Anna had nothing
  but good things to say about him; she was always going on about how nice and funny
  he is. It was pretty obvious she was starting to develop a crush. We joked a couple
  times about her sleeping with him and she always said she''d never and that they
  were just flirting.


  About two months later, we were walking back from a party with a small group of
  girls and she was pretty drunk. One girl noticed that she kept messaging someone
  and asked her who it was and Anna blurted out that the name of our TA. Shocked,
  I asked her why she was messaging him and she just giggled and said that he wanted
  her to come over to his apartment but she didn''t want to because she was so drunk.
  The other girls, not really realizing who it was, thought it was so funny and continued
  teasing her asking if he was cute. Another girl asked if she''d slept with him yet
  and Anna said yeah, a couple times. I was just completely taken aback by that.


  That was last weekend. I texted her about it the day after and she admitted that
  it was true and it started happening last month. She said it was nothing serious
  and they''re just having fun. I didn''t really respond. Well, I sat on it for a
  couple of days and talked with a few of my close friends about it. Most of them
  told me to report the incident to the professor or department chair because it''s
  a serious violation and that she won''t get in trouble, only the TA will. I sent
  an email to my professor about it last night leaving out Anna''s name and only saying
  who the TA was. He responded this morning and said that it was indeed an incredibly
  serious violation and that he would like to have a meeting with me and the department
  chair sometime this week. It all got really serious all of a sudden and I don''t
  know why but I feel like I fucked up really badly. I don''t know what I was expecting
  but this just made me feel like an asshole for some reason.


  Edit: Should probably add that we''re second-years and the TA is a first-year grad
  student so probably 22-23.'
