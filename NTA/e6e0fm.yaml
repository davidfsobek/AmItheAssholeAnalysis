selftext: "Growing up every year around the holidays my mom would make fudge. The\
  \ story was this amazing fudge recipe came from her grandma who snagged it from\
  \ a famous candy maker.  My mom didn't get the recipe until she was an adult and\
  \ we were always told that we couldn't have it until we were 30. \n\nIn my late\
  \ teens my mom asked me to help make the fudge with her a few times. The recipe\
  \ is very simple and this was all the exposure I needed to memorize it. I've never\
  \ once needed to write the recipe down. \n\nIt came out that I had the recipe early\
  \ and my mom and her mom were both outraged. I was given many warnings against sharing\
  \ family secrets and told they were disappointed at my sneaking around them. I've\
  \ never shared the recipe with anyone besides my brother and sister. I don't have\
  \ the same feelings about recipe hoarding, but I followed tradition. However even\
  \ now, 15ish years later, I'll get comments about how they don't entirely trust\
  \ me since I came by the recipe dishonestly. \n\nTonight I was reading an article\
  \ about a chef doing research on secret family recipes for pickled herring. He managed\
  \ to get copies of hundreds of recipes-200 of them were identical. He traced them\
  \ back to a cookbook from the 1960s. This got me thinking about our family recipe.\
  \ \n\nAfter not much googling at all I found \"our\" exact recipe on the website\
  \ for an evaporated milk company. They apparently have also printed the recipe on\
  \ cans over the years. \n\nThis leads me to believe that either my grandma or her\
  \ mother actually got the recipe from a can and lied about it's origin. \n\nI think\
  \ this is hilarious and want to share the information. We've been so secretive about\
  \ a recipe that's in public domain!  There's really no reason to hoard it anymore.\
  \ \n\nWould I be the asshole if I shared this knowledge with my mom?"

  of a can?
