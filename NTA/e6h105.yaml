selftext: 'There is a guy who just started showing up at the gym I go to. He seems
  relatively fit but nothing impressive. He may have gone in the past to this gym,
  but I''ve been going off and on for the past 5 years or so and never have seen him.


  When he first started showing up, he introduced himself to lots of people usually
  interrupting their workouts. "Hi, I''m Shane."


  Anyway, my girlfriend and I usually work out at slightly different times and usually
  are at different sides of the gym when we''re working out together. Numerous times
  when my GF has had her headphones in, Shane has gone up to her to ask her stuff.
  This one day while she was benching with headphones in, he went up to her and asked
  her if she needed a spot. She clearly did not need a spot.


  The other day, Shane very loudly burped and said "Fuck that was disgusting!"The
  whole gym went quiet for a moment. Last night he showed up and went over to the
  hack squat machine (which is near a main walkway). He put no weight on it but stood
  up on it and was just talking to people who walked by. Some dudes actually talk
  to him and some people look really annoyed when he interacts with them. A really
  attractive lady walked past him while he was just standing on the hack squat machine
  and he STARED at her until she got close to the machine and then said something
  like "what''s up? How are you?" She said something quietly and briefly and kept
  walking. He. Kept. Staring.


  Personally, he annoys me. He''s very obnoxious and he annoys my girlfriend. I don''t
  think she''ll file a complaint against him because she''s just not that type. WIBTA
  if I report  him to the gym staff? Or should I just ignore him and wait until someone
  else does it?

  Update: General consensus seems to be that I am NTA. There has been much conflicting
  advice with what I should do. Some of the gym staff knows me so I''ll casually talk
  to them about this dude instead of ''reporting'' him to see if they have noticed
  his behavior or if they know if he''s autistic. For the people saying that I am
  the asshole, I appreciate the response and see where you''re coming from. I am fine
  with being an asshole.


  Another update: I''m reading all of these responses even if I''m not responding.
  There''s a lot of them and some of you are asking/saying the same things and I just
  don''t feel like putting in the effort to respond. This gym is not in Baltimore
  or Indiana or where you are from. It''s not your gym, I almost guarantee it. I included
  the statement "He seems relatively fit but nothing impressive" not to be rude but
  to say that he clearly knows what he''s doing but he''s not a gym rat.'
