selftext: "So, let's start I've been with my GF for a year and she's wonderful, smart,\
  \ and all that jazz but she has an issue dressing for the weather. Her outfits are\
  \ just whatever she's in the mood to wear. Sometimes in the Summer she'll be wearing\
  \ too many clothes, and in the Winter she'll *almost never* wear a jacket unless\
  \ I badger her like her Dad into bringing one. She'll grab a sweater like it gives\
  \ the same insulation like a real jacket.\n\nThere's been SOOOO many times where\
  \ we are going to the movies or something and it's cold af and she'll ask for my\
  \ jacket and I'll hand it to her then tough it out freezing. \n\nSo, boom. This\
  \ weekend I had friends I hadn't seen since college wanting to meet up for drinks.\
  \ I know with them they like to bar hop and go to a few different places especially\
  \ if a place is dead. Knowing that I made sure to text her before she left her place\
  \ to bring a jacket before she met us at the bar. We were both ubering to meet up\
  \ there.\n\nI'm having the first round catching up with everyone and she comes through\
  \ he door wearing a black sleeveless dress that stopped at like midthigh AND NO\
  \ JACKET. The bar itself wasn't even super warm I could look at her and tell she\
  \ was going to be freezing in the bar let alone if we decided to leave. We are a\
  \ few drinks in and she tells me she's cold. I don't offer my jacket like normal.\
  \ And, ask her why didn't she bring hers. She says she forgot it and by the time\
  \ she realized it she was already downstairs with the Uber driver ready for pick\
  \ up. I tell her I'm not giving her my jacket and how I'm tired of going through\
  \ this over and over.\n\nShe was pissed all night and borderline shivering at times.\
  \ We went to 3 more bars and she'd Uber there to meet up so she didn't have to walk\
  \ in the cold. At the last bar she told me she was just going to go home since I\
  \ wanted to be a jerk. She said her goodbyes and left. The friend group didn't see\
  \ or hear us fighting but could see the body language was off and I told them that\
  \ she was mad I didn't give her my jacket and half of them thought I was an asshole\
  \ for not helping her and other half said she should have brought one herself.\n\
  \nAITA?"
