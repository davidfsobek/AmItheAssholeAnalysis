selftext: 'Jessica is the girl, my boyfriend Mark and I are both guys. We''re all
  members of a student''s club and while Mark and I have been members for a couple
  of years, Jessica joined about 2 months ago. As soon as she joined, she started
  drooling all over Mark and he was too embarrassed to tell her he''s gay so he just
  spent most of the time avoiding her.


  I thought it was ridiculous, so when 10ish of us went out for drinks recently, we
  made it clear that we''re a couple. We behaved as we usually do since all of our
  friends from the club know we''re together, and Jessica saw it and she was like
  ohhhhhh you guys are a coupleeee! And we confirmed, but then Jessica, who I guess
  is a bit weird, started laughing and said: oh my god, that''s so embarrassing, I
  totally have a crush on you, Mark!


  Things haven''t changed much since then, she''s still all over Mark whenever she
  sees him, she makes comments like: you sure you''re not at least bisexual? or ugh,
  if I was a guy would you give me a chance?


  I hate it, he hates it, and we both started avoiding her. A mutual friend, who thinks
  Jessica is just sooo hilarious and lovely and cute and nice, thinks that we''re
  kind of assholes for not hanging out with her. She says we''re missing out on so
  much. And she said she kind of gets it that Jessica is too much for Mark, but that
  I have no excuse for shunning her and that I''m only being an asshole.'
