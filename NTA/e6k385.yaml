selftext: "My best friend from childhood moved back to our hometown and when he came\
  \ back he was the size of a house with legit the fittest body I\u2019ve ever seen.\
  \ \n\nBecause my doc has been telling me to lose weight for years I asked him if\
  \ he would help me. He basically forced me to sign up to the gym and go with him\
  \ everyday and he told me to change my diet. What works for him (and me too now)\
  \ is Keto and it\u2019s changed my life. He explained to me what I could eat and\
  \ couldn\u2019t and the weight literally melted off me. I\u2019ve never been able\
  \ to stick to a diet before but Keto is different. \n\nMy BP and cholesterol levels\
  \ are the lowest/ best they\u2019ve been in years and my doc is so proud that I\u2019\
  ve lost weight. I\u2019m also fitter than I\u2019ve been in years. \n\nI do all\
  \ the cooking, I work from 5am-6pm and as soon as I come home I\u2019ll get dinner\
  \ going. Our meals are all Keto but I haven\u2019t stopped buying snacks like chips,\
  \ chocolate etc for my girlfriend because she likes the house to be stocked with\
  \ that. \n\nI usually do steak & broccoli, bacon omelettes, fondue with asparagus,\
  \ I\u2019ve learned how to make Keto pizza and garlic bread and waffles and stuff\
  \ so I do try and keep a rotation so it\u2019s not boring. Anyway she absolutely\
  \ *hates* everything  I\u2019m cooking and told me she misses rice and mashed potato,\
  \ pasta etc. She isn\u2019t big on meat and isn\u2019t too hot on cheese and butter\
  \ unless it\u2019s in pasta. I told her that I don\u2019t want to cook pasta or\
  \ make mashed potatoes, I can do it as a once in a while thing but she said that\
  \ she doesn\u2019t want that and she wants to not come home to just bacon and eggs,\
  \ which isn\u2019t what I give her anyway, I actually make an effort to cook an\
  \ interesting meal unless I\u2019m super tired. \n\nI said I could do pasta substitutes\
  \ but she got extremely pissed with me and told me that I\u2019m being selfish by\
  \ not taking into account that she \u2018just wants to eat normal food\u2019. AITA?"

  \ into eating because she doesn\u2019t cook?"
