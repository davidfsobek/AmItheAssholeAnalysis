selftext: "Just to get it out of the way I won't be poisoning anyone or attempting\
  \ to murder them in any way. \n\nThe issue I am having is that someone keeps stealing\
  \ my coke from the office fridge. It only occurs overnight and I want to leave it\
  \ in the fridge overnight so I have a cold can of coke when I arrive at work. \n\
  \nI have attempted to prevent this from happening in numerous ways but I haven't\
  \ been successful so far. I was leaving them in the fridge and when I have 2-3 cans\
  \ left they will be gone by the morning. So I started putting them in different\
  \ fridge in a different kitchen in the office (I work in a big firm) and they would\
  \ disappear again. \n\nThen I started putting them in a plastic bag to indicate\
  \ that they are someone's. And it did help for a while, but it started happening\
  \ again. It went as bad as them stealing 6 cans at once. \n\nMy latest solution\
  \ is to keep them in a cupboard no one uses and just leave one can in the fridge\
  \ overnight in a plastic bag, which I have to fold in a ball so it is not obvious\
  \ it's a can of coke. And if I forget to do so they would steal it. This is not\
  \ an ideal solution to me as I have to constantly keep track of it. \n\nI know this\
  \ might sound pretty to you and that I am making a big deal out of it but to me\
  \ it is really annoying to go to work expecting to have coke for the day just to\
  \ find that someone got all of it. \n\nNow to the asshole part. My plan is to slightly\
  \ crack open on of the cans so it is open but the metal bit is not fully detached.\
  \ What I am worried about is that they might put it in their backpack and it might\
  \ spill all over their laptop and damage it while all I want is for the coke to\
  \ be flat when they get it. WIBTA?"
