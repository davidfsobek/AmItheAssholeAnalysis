selftext: "So my boyfriend and I have been together for 4 years and we are buying\
  \ our first home together.\nWe talked about marriage and how we both want to marry\
  \ each other but he always said the house is our first priority, then he would propose\
  \ shortly after.\nWe are less than 1 week away from closing. Everything is set and\
  \ done and we are just waiting to show up and give the rest of our down payment.\n\
  \nWe went to a home expo this past Saturday and there were a bunch of raffles and\
  \ giveaways for things like free driveway paving, furniture gift cards, even money\
  \ towards remodeling. \nWe entered most of the free raffles we saw because why not.\
  \ \nThere was a bridal/wedding section and they were giving away a 15k wedding.\
  \ I entered because obviously no one ever wins these things, right?\n\nWrong, I\
  \ got picked. They announced a winner a few hours later and I was beyond stunned.\
  \ Excitement took over and I looked at my boyfriend in disbelief. Horror Immediately\
  \ showed on his face. We went to the main center to claim and he asked if we can\
  \ swap our prize for something else or if you can be paid out for it. No, it\u2019\
  s literally a credit the venue is giving you to use their facility, caterers, and\
  \ alcohol. You have 12 months until the deadline to reserve the date.\nHe then looks\
  \ at me and says that maybe we should forfeit and let someone else have it who can\
  \ really use it. \nMy eyes start tearing and I ask him what he means. He says that\
  \ we\u2019re not even engaged yet and we can figure out planning and paying for\
  \ a wedding then. \nI tell him that I thought we\u2019re getting engaged when we\
  \ move in the house and he said yes but he doesn\u2019t want to be on a time limit.\n\
  \nWe don\u2019t get the prize and leave. I\u2019ve been staying at my parent\u2019\
  s since. I feel like we had a once in a lifetime chance to have a wedding paid for\
  \ especially after spending most of our money on a house. \nI don\u2019t think I\
  \ want to continue with the house. We would lose 8k of earnest money. love my boyfriend\
  \ and we\u2019re 99.9% of the time amazing. But I feel like he\u2019s stringing\
  \ me along because there\u2019s no logical reason why not to take the prize. \n\
  I don\u2019t think he plans to get engaged after we buy. I feel like it was an excuse\n\
  \nUpdate-\n\nWe had a long talk yesterday in person and I pretty much asked him\
  \ if he ever does intent to marry me. He kept saying yes eventually, etc.\nI told\
  \ him that I\u2019ll buy this house with him but if he doesn\u2019t make good on\
  \ his promise to propose by this Spring then I will stop paying my half of the mortgage\
  \ and put the house for sale. I told him not to take me down this road if he is\
  \ planning on an excuse.\nHe got angry and then went quiet.\n\nA couple hours later\
  \ he spilled his guts that he loves me but he doesn\u2019t want to commit to marriage.\
  \ I asked him what his ideal timeline would be, 1-3 more years? He said that he\
  \ doesn\u2019t know if he ever wants to get married and just wants to own a house\
  \ with a girlfriend and maybe never marry.\nI was sobbing at this point and asked\
  \ him why he lead me on promising a proposal this spring. He said he really wanted\
  \ us to be together and own a house and he thought I would lose interest once I\
  \ see how great just owning our house would be.\nI am devastated. I\u2019m giving\
  \ him 4K towards the earnest we are losing because I\u2019m backing out of the house.\
  \ \n\nWe didn\u2019t officially break up but I told him I\u2019m moving out of our\
  \ apartment and staying with my parents for the time being. I feel so hurt and betrayed."
