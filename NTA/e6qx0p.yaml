selftext: "I'm in a relatively small computer graphics class, about 14 people. My\
  \ Professor has learned everyone's name but mine. And it's a pretty common girls\
  \ name. The first few time he called me the wrong name I politely corrected him.\
  \ But after the 5th or 6th time I stopped responding to him. Today during a critique\
  \ he said \"samantha what's your opinion on the piece\". My name is not samantha\
  \ and there's no samantha in the class. I ignored him and he called my \"name\"\
  \ again. I told him that's not my name. He got annoyed and said I should have known\
  \ he was talking to me because he was looking at me.\n\nEDIT: HOLY CRAP I did not\
  \ expect this big of a response. After I made the post I spoke to a few other people\
  \ (girls included) in my class. Apparently this Professor is known for being very\
  \ arrogant and full of himself. He acts this way all the time and it's not his way\
  \ of being funny. Sadly I have him next semester because he's the only one who teaches\
  \ the class I need. I'll keep you updated! Let me know if you want more stories\
  \ on the semi unprofessional things he's done.\nP.s thanks for the silver \U0001F601\
  \n\nEDIT 2: Thank you for all the advice, as much as I'd like to be just as rude\
  \ to him as he is to me I've decided to talk to him and tell him I understand he\
  \ teaches more than one class but it bothers me when he call me the wrong name.\
  \ Thank you for the advice"
title: AITA for not responding to a Professor after he's called me the wrong name
  even after I've repeatedly collected him?
