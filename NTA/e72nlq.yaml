selftext: "Some context:\n\nI\u2019m extremely pregnant (like waddling Danny-DeVito-as-The-Penguin\
  \ pregnant) and fighting a chest cold, back pain, bruised rib, overall fatigue,\
  \ and a womb resident that won\u2019t quit moving (which is a good thing, but can\
  \ be painful!). I work from home, which makes it easier. \n\nMy boyfriend has an\
  \ abscess that requires a root canal. YIKES. I\u2019ve never had a root canal, but\
  \ tooth/mouth pain is no joke. He works in a field where he\u2019s on his feet for\
  \ sometimes 12+ hours a day. \n\nThe setup:\n\nYesterday, he came home early after\
  \ the dentist. Knowing that he\u2019s been tired and feeling bad, last night I got\
  \ him set up in bed, made him dinner (twice), picked up his antibiotics, brought\
  \ him ice cream and tea, and overall just made sure he had everything he needed.\
  \ I even slept in the other room, as I tend to get up a lot because pregnancy is\
  \ uncomfortable and I didn\u2019t want to bug him. Truly, I\u2019m happy to do it.\
  \ \n\nThis morning, I woke up to a text from him that just said, \u201CI need water.\u201D\
  \n\n*I need water.*\n\nI was annoyed, because even though he\u2019s not feeling\
  \ well, a tooth abscess doesn\u2019t take away your ability to walk. I brought it\
  \ to him anyway, and he made a big deal about lifting himself up to drink from the\
  \ cup and take two ibuprofen. No \u201Cthank you.\u201D Just put his head back down\
  \ and closed his eyes. \n\nPain is pain\u2014I get it. I don\u2019t have a monopoly\
  \ on discomfort just because pregnancy can sometimes really blow. It\u2019s not\
  \ a competition. But it is kind of cringe-y to demand your pregnant girlfriend,\
  \ who already has some mobility issues and near-constant pain, to grab you something\
  \ you could easily get yourself. \n\nThe AITA dilemma:\n\nTrying to be lighthearted\
  \ about the audacity of that text request, I drew a picture on his breakfast cup\
  \ (something I do every day when I make his breakfast) of a tombstone with the words\
  \ \u201CI need water\u201D on it, surrounded by flowers and with his birth year\
  \ - 2019 on it. \n\nHe was...not happy. Like, actually mad that I did that. He said\
  \ my humor \u201Cis not normal,\u201D and that it\u2019s not at all funny. He left\
  \ in a huff and without saying goodbye. \n\nSo, AITA for the joke? Or am I missing\
  \ the real issue entirely?\n\n*ETA: We both apologized for not being considerate\
  \ of the other person, and it\u2019s all ok. He\u2019s a good dude, just off his\
  \ game today. Still doesn\u2019t think I\u2019m as funny as I think I am, though\u2014\
  lol.*"
