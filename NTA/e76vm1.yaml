selftext: "So I've had a cold or something and my girlfriend got me some homeopathic\
  \ \"medicine\". I refused to take it on the grounds that homeopathy is really stupid.\
  \ Shit is literally just sugar pills. She got mad and called me closed minded. \n\
  \nI told my mom about this. She agrees that homeopathy is stupid, but thinks that\
  \ I should have taken it (or at least been more diplomatic in my refusal). After\
  \ all, sugar pills won't hurt me.  The way I see it, I would be helping to perpetuate\
  \ that nonsense by taking the \"medicine\" because I will probably get better soon\
  \ and my girlfriend will falsely attribute it to the \"medicine\"."
