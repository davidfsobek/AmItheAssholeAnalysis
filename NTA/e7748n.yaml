selftext: "So my wife and I just got into a big argument. I need to vent but now,\
  \ I feel like I\u2019m being a asshole.\n\nHere\u2019s some context. My wife and\
  \ I have been married for 15 years. Been together since our teens. I have been supporting\
  \ our relationship financially since we been together. She hasn\u2019t worked a\
  \ job since 2004. She doesn\u2019t drive and stays home and tends to our 12 and\
  \ 5 year old.\n\nWe recently moved to a new city and cost of living is a little\
  \ bit more than we are used to. I asked her today that next year when I our 5 year\
  \ old goes to elementary school, would she get a job because we kinda live paycheck\
  \ to paycheck. And just my job and disability benefits from the military aren\u2019\
  t cutting it. She lost her shit saying that being a mother and homemaker is more\
  \ rewarding that any job she can have. She said that I should be the one to get\
  \ a second job. And with as demanding as my current position is, there is no way\
  \ I can travel for my business and work a second job. So am I the asshole for asking\
  \ her to get a job?"
