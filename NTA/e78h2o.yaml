selftext: "I recently broke up with my boyfriend after he found Jesus again during\
  \ our relationship. I'm firmly agnostic and he was athetist until he did a 180 after\
  \ his father recovered from Cancer. \n\nWe have a lot of mutual friends as we both\
  \ went to a Christian private school since both our families are various degrees\
  \ of religious. \n\nI found out two days ago I'm two weeks pregnant and have booked\
  \ a termination since I'm uninterested I'm having a child with him. I confided in\
  \ a close friend who is ultimately prochoice but she's said that I'm an asshole\
  \ if I don't tell my ex about the kid before I do it. She thinks he deserves to\
  \ know as the father and emotionally it will devastate him if he finds out in the\
  \ future.\n\nI think its more damaging if he were to grow attached to a child I\
  \ have 0 intention of keeping. I am almost 100% certain if I tell him, he will harass\
  \ me to keep it and try get together again. He's gone full fundementalist and one\
  \ of the reasons we broke up is because I refused to go to church with him.\n\n\
  Would I be an asshole if I refuse to inform him and getting a termination without\
  \ his consent?"
