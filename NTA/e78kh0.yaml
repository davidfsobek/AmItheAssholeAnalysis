selftext: "Three years ago, my husband lost his wife of 18 years. She passed from\
  \ a brain tumor, only 11 months passed between her diagnosis and her death. She\
  \ was only 41 years old and left behind 4 children ranging from the ages of 5-16.\
  \ \n\nI have actually known my husband for about 8 years, as we work together. I\
  \ always found him to be a handsome guy, but never did I start falling for him until\
  \ a year after his first wife passed. He even introduced me to their kids before\
  \ we officially started dating. They all accepted me with open arms and have all\
  \ been nothing short of amazing. \n\nWe got married last November and welcomed our\
  \ daughter in September. About a month back, we had some family photos done with\
  \ all 7 of us. They finally arrived in the mail recently and I decided to start\
  \ framing & hanging them throughout the house. There are 4 photos with my husbands\
  \ late wife hanging around the house. 3 of them are old family photos and the other\
  \ is a shot of just her. \n\nThere are only so many places to hang photos in this\
  \ house, so I decided to move one of the old \u2018family\u2019 photos and place\
  \ our newly done photo there. The old frame was a lot smaller than the new one I\
  \ had put it, so I moved the old one to a more tight spot in a less visible area\
  \ of the house.\n\nI soon came to the realization that this may have come off a\
  \ bit tacky, so I talked to my husband and children about it upon their arrival\
  \ from work/school. They all said it was no big deal and encouraged me to leave\
  \ the newly framed photo in this spot, which I did.\n\nOver the weekend, \u2018\
  her\u2019 parents came over to visit with the kids. They, especially her mother,\
  \ have always seemed to have a blatant disdain for me. She discouraged my husband\
  \ from marrying me because I was \u2018too young\u2019 to help raise 4 children\
  \ . Then, she yelled at me for referring to myself as the kids mother. Despite the\
  \ tense past, I have never seen her as angry as she was about the changing of pictures.\
  \ \n\nShe accused me of trying to replace her daughter by giving rid of all evidence\
  \ that she once lived in the house. I assured her that was not the case. She demanded\
  \ that I put the original picture back in its place and find another spot to put\
  \ my photo. I refused, telling her that my husband and her grandchildren had all\
  \ approved of the way I did things. She then when on a long rant about how I have\
  \ no respect for her or her husband. I replied by saying that this is my house and\
  \ I will do things the way I want just as she can arrange the things she wants in\
  \ her own house. They angrily stormed out of the house and we haven\u2019t heard\
  \ from them since. \n\nPerhaps I came off a little too hard, but this woman has\
  \ been making my life miserable from day one. I had simply had enough and felt that\
  \ I had to put my foot down and stop letting her get away with the \u2018grieving\u2019\
  \ excuse."
