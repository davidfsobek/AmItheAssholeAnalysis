selftext: "  I\u2019m 19 and my brother is 22.\n\nTwo years ago, my parents got divorced.\
  \ Four months later it was revealed that the reason for the divorce was that my\
  \ Dad was transgender. In the matter of a minute, the man I grew up with died and\
  \ replaced by a completely different person named Kate. \n\nMy brother did not take\
  \ the news well and cut Kate out his life for a while. For me, I have been supportive\
  \ of her transition, while grieving at the same time.\n\nFor Thanksgiving, Kate\
  \ invited my brother and I over for dinner with her partner. It took a lot of convincing\
  \ to get my brother to go. Dinner was going okay, until Kate stated it would be\
  \ her greatest wish if we called her mom. My brother yelled absolutely not and stormed\
  \ out. When Kate looked at me for support, I told her that I would never call her\
  \ mom or see her as such\n\nLater that night, I received a text from Kate\u2019\
  s partner, who said Kate was extremely hurt by the rejection. I didn\u2019t know\
  \ how to handle the text, so I showed it to my brother. He called Kate and yelled\
  \ at her for trying to emotionally manipulate me.\n\nSince Thanksgiving night, neither\
  \ of us has talked to Kate.  When I recounted the story to one of my friends, she\
  \ said that I was technically an asshole for siccing my brother on Kate and never\
  \ standing up for her or acknowledging her wish. After hearing that, my emotions\
  \ have become more complicated, so I decided on a second opinion. So, what am I\
  \ Reddit?\n\nEdit: \n\nI've been reading the comments and thank you to everyone.\
  \  Some additional info.  When she came out Kate asked my brother and I to stop\
  \ calling her dad immediately and just Kate.\n\nKate's partner is a woman.\n\nMy\
  \ Mom did initiate the divorce. Kate being trans was the biggest issue, but there\
  \ were other reasons as well such as Kate having an emotional affair with her now\
  \ partner(I didn't find this out until much later and my brother definitely doesnt\
  \ know.)"
