selftext: "FINAL EDIT AT BOTTOM:\nAs a side gig I teach once a week for a local university.\
  \ The students come to the hospital where I work and I teach them by doing direct\
  \ patient care. They also have written assignments to complete, some for me in the\
  \ clinical setting and some in the classroom. Most of the students I have are seniors,\
  \ so college work is not new to them. \n\nThis semester I have a student who just\
  \ has a lack of motivation and puts in little effort. Her assignments are usually\
  \ submitted late, but there is nothing in the syllabus that states they can\u2019\
  t be turned in late for full credit \U0001F644 The students are also allowed to\
  \ redo one failed assignment for full credit. She failed her first assignment and\
  \ I have reminded her throughout the term that she has to redo it because it\u2019\
  s a required assignment to pass the course. \n\nShe shows up exactly on time or\
  \ 2-3 minutes late for class. Their syllabus states that they must be on time for\
  \ the clinical portion of class (that I teach) or they will be sent home and their\
  \ absence unexcused. I have not kicked her out when she\u2019s been 2-3 minutes\
  \ late because it just seems petty. She has also missed a couple of classes that\
  \ had to be made up with other clinical experiences to get her required hours. I\u2019\
  ve discussed this with her course professor and also with the student in her midterm\
  \ evaluation. \n\nShe missed her second to last clinical and I reminded her that\
  \ she would have to complete that final assignment at her last clinical to pass.\
  \ She assured me she would. I had a conversation with her classroom professor who\
  \ has also been frustrated with the student this term. She had just finally turned\
  \ in an assignment that was 3 weeks late. I was annoyed by that because she ended\
  \ up getting the same grade as students who completed it on time. Next semester\
  \ the syllabus will specify points lost for late assignments. This hasn\u2019t historically\
  \ been an issue. \n\nHer course professor had a conversation with her in class last\
  \ week about her final clinical and that assignment absolutely having to pass or\
  \ she fails the course. On the last day of clinical, all the students were there,\
  \ dressed in scrubs, ready for patient rounds, on time. Except this student who\
  \ walked in 3 minutes late and not dressed. I said \u201CYou are late and you are\
  \ not ready. This is unprofessional. You need to leave immediately.\u201D \n\nSo,\
  \ my making her leave means she fails the course because there is no other chance\
  \ to make it up and it\u2019s final exam week. It also means it delays her graduation\
  \ by at least one semester because she will have to retake that course and can\u2019\
  t take a course next term that needs this one as a pre-req. At the time I felt very\
  \ justified in sending her home. She\u2019s been given several warnings and multiple\
  \ breaks with late work. But now I\u2019m feeling kind of like I might have been\
  \ an asshole in kicking her out knowing it guaranteed her course failure when I\u2019\
  ve let her stay when she was late in the past. What do you think, Reddit?\n\nEDIT:\n\
  I\u2019ve had a few comments where I\u2019ve addressed this and it should probably\
  \ be added to the original post. \n\nI did discuss her tardiness with her several\
  \ times. At the beginning of the term she was 2-3 minutes late every day. At first\
  \ I said \u201CBe careful of your time!\u201D Then a more stern \u201CWe start on\
  \ time, you need to be dressed and ready to go by the start of clinical.\u201D But\
  \ I was trying not to be a total hard ass over 2 minutes. At midterm I had to do\
  \ a written evaluation of each student. I put on there that she was often tardy\
  \ and needed to be on time. Those go in her file. I also filed an Academic Improvement\
  \ Plan which discussed her tardiness to clinical and those failed assignments. The\
  \ AIP outlines future expectations which included being on time and turning in assignments.\
  \ The AIP stays in her file and goes to her academic advisor. At that time I told\
  \ her she had to be on time and ready for clinical, or the next tine she would be\
  \ sent home.\n\nEDIT 2:\nHoly cow, I shut my phone off for a couple of hours to\
  \ go see a movie and this is exploding!! I\u2019m trying really hard to catch up\
  \ on reading everyone\u2019s comments and answer questions. Bear with me if you\
  \ posted a question, I\u2019m trying to weave me way through this thread. \n\nI\u2019\
  ve seen a few comments and gotten a bunch of dm\u2019s calling me a misogynistic\
  \ pig. I\u2019m a female. This student being a female had zero to do with my decision.\
  \ Last term I had a male student who behaved similarly and nearly failed, but finally\
  \ got his shit together and showed up on time. I don\u2019t care what their gender\
  \ is, just do your freaking work. \n\nAnd for the people saying I\u2019m TA because\
  \ why does 2-3 minutes make a difference? You clearly have no idea what rounds are\
  \ like in a hospital. At the time it begins you have doctors, nurses, residents,\
  \ students, possibly case managers, social workers, etc, who assemble in a group\
  \ to present each patient\u2019s case. Every one of them is ready to go. At our\
  \ hospital, an overhead announcement is made 10 minutes before rounds start so that\
  \ everyone gets their shit together and is ready. I\u2019ve told my students it\u2019\
  s best to arrive about 10-15 min early so they can be changed in hospital scrubs\
  \ and in the group ready to go. Nobody is waiting 2-3 minutes for a student to catch\
  \ up. And you can be damn sure nobody is waiting 10 minutes for a student who came\
  \ in late and wasn\u2019t dressed.\n\nFINAL EDIT: Wow, I really didn\u2019t expect\
  \ this to garner so many comments! I tried really hard to read all of them and answer\
  \ the ones asking for more info. I thought it would be easiest to update the most\
  \ frequently asked questions here. \n\nYes, I did attempt to find out what was going\
  \ on in her personal life. I\u2019m not an ogre. I wanted to help her and would\
  \ have been willing to help her in any way I could if she\u2019d given me anything\
  \ I could work with. Her tardiness was typically the result of staying out too late\
  \ and sleeping as late as possible. The incomplete and late assignments were the\
  \ result of failing another course and focusing more on bringing her grade up there.\
  \ So I tried being flexible on both to keep her sane, which evidently was not what\
  \ I should have done. \n\nShe did not fail because she was late for class. She had\
  \ a required assignment 3 months ago that she failed. She put the redo off for 3\
  \ months. The day before her final clinical practicum she was advised that it was\
  \ her last chance to complete it and that she had to be on time and prepared because\
  \ she was on a final written warning for tardiness. Her failing grade comes from\
  \ not completing a required assignment. \n\nI do not know if she has ADHD. I will\
  \ keep that in mind in the future if I see this again. \n\nI have requested that\
  \ the course professor edit the syllabus next term to include a clause for late\
  \ assignments. It\u2019s not my syllabus to write. I don\u2019t teach in the classroom.\
  \ \n\nDue to a lot of comments I\u2019ve read, I now realize that I need to be more\
  \ of a hard ass in enforcing attendance rules and wasn\u2019t doing anyone any favors\
  \ trying to be lenient. So, in the future I will allow the one tardy with a warning.\
  \ Second time I will send them home. \n\nThank you everyone for your feedback! I\
  \ really was conflicted over it. I felt like since I have her a final written warning\
  \ saying her next tardy resulted in her being sent home, she needed to be sent home.\
  \ I just struggled a bit because of it being her last chance to complete her assignment.\
  \ But you\u2019ve all made me realize that it was her choice and she was aware of\
  \ those consequences. I appreciate all of your comments, no matter how you voted.\
  \ It helped me to look deeper at what I was doing and what I will do in the future."
