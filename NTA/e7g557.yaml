selftext: "My fiancee and I have been engaged for 6 months, dating for 2 years. He\
  \ has an 8 year old daughter with his ex wife (let's call her Sophie). He doesn't\
  \ want any more children. This suits me fine. I'm OK with being a stepmother, but\
  \ being pregnant and dealing with a baby/toddler full time has never appealed to\
  \ me.\n\nI have a 10 year old niece (let's call her Olivia) that I am very involved\
  \ with. My bother and his wife struggle financially (at lot of it is bad debt and\
  \ choosing to drop out of school. They are also not the brightest crayons on the\
  \ box, as nice as they are) while I have a very good job as an attorney, so I maintain\
  \ a college fund for Olivia. It won't be a blank cheque to go anywhere she wants,\
  \ but if I maintain it, it will be enough to pay for 4 years at a state school,\
  \ and we do have a public Ivy in our state and Olivia is very bright. I also have\
  \ Olivia listed to inherit my estate at this point and my half of the joint estate\
  \ after marriage. \n\nHe wants me to stop Olivia's college fund and to not leave\
  \ her money. He thinks I should now be helping him to provide for Sophie. He thinks\
  \ that money should go into Sophie's college fund as we are getting married. \n\n\
  I think Sophie is his financial responsibility.\n\nOf course, I'm not going to bitch\
  \ about things like about the grocery/restaurant bill being higher to buy food she\
  \ eats or more gas being used to drive her around while she is here. I'm not going\
  \ to take myself for a donut after picking her up and not buy her one.\n\nBut I\
  \ think major things like her college fund are not my responsibility and are the\
  \ responsibility of her parents.\n\nI don't think I am being unreasonable because\
  \ Sophie has two college educated parents with decent jobs to provide for her (her\
  \ mom is very much in the picture), while Olivia does not.\n\nSO said it is not\
  \ \"my problem\" my brother and SIL don't have great jobs, but it is also not Olivia's\
  \ fault. I also think if I am contributing towards a mortgage, I deserve a say in\
  \ how the estate is divided when we die. Or.....I am also aware that my SO and I\
  \ could end up divorced and I'll never see Sophie again and I'll have been putting\
  \ into a college fund of a kid I have nothing to do with.\n\nI do care about Sophie\
  \ and am fond of her, but I do love Olivia more because she is my niece and I've\
  \ been in her life all along. \n\nI have told him that I am obviously happy for\
  \ Sophie to be one of the beneficiaries of our estate, but I think I should be able\
  \ to have one too if he has Sophie. He even gets bitchy when I buy Olivia good presents\
  \ and spend money on her, like when I took her to see BTS (a band she loves). If\
  \ he doesn't back down, I might break off the engagement, but I'm curious if I am\
  \ being the asshole here. \n\nI don't not care about my Stepdaughter, but I don't\
  \ think it is unreasonable to still want to provide for my beloved niece.\n\n\n\
  **UPDATE: I am not going to be marrying him and broke off the engagement. I tried\
  \ to talk to him tonight and it ended in him picking a huge argument with me and\
  \ the things he said made it very clear he is resentful of Olivia and believes I\
  \ need to be \"replacing\" her with Sophie. When I tried to explain to him that\
  \ Sophie already has a mother she lives with most of the time who does not want\
  \ me to be replacing her, she literally said \"I am not saying you need to replace\
  \ her, but you need to be contributing financially because that's what happens and\
  \ she is my responsibility and you need to help me with my financial responsibilities.\
  \ So basically, he wants me to have the responsibilities of looking after her, while\
  \ being suitably detached. He was also hostile about Olivia and said that marrying\
  \ means joining a new family and I am joining his so get to leave the \"dead weight\"\
  \ behind. I asked if he was calling Olivia \"dead weight\". He hesitated, and I\
  \ took the ring off, threw it at him and went and packed a bag and went and got\
  \ a hotel because it was late. I will deal with it in the coming days, but I will\
  \ not be marrying him**."
title: AITA for not wanting to contribute from my income to my stepdaughter's college
  fund because I want to contribute to my (blood) niece's?
