selftext: 'So my family is going through a bit of a "baby boom" at the moment, with
  seven women currently pregnant (and one who just gave birth), including my own mother.
  My cousins and I are excited about the new additions to our family, but we are worried
  about one cousin in particular (we''ll call her "Lucy"). So, Lucy adores children
  and babies and is always eager to babysit and care for the kids. She is the type
  to kiss babies all over their face. My other cousins and I are also aware of the
  fact that she recently contracted herpes, and while we do want to support her, it
  has lead to us not sharing stuff like lip gloss, straws, food, etc with her. We
  know the chances of contracting herpes is low once the virus makes contact with
  the air, but we don''t wanna risk it. Because of this, we''re also worried about
  our newborn siblings getting the virus from her. Would I (or rather, we) be the
  asshole if we asked her to not kiss the babies or share anything that may have her
  saliva on it with the babies?


  Edit: I read all the comments, and I think it would be best to just ask my mom to
  make it a general rule that people don''t kiss her baby on the face instead of just
  singling out Lucy. That way, no one feels bad and the babies are still safe'
