selftext: "Alright, hear me out.\nMy little brother is mixed. We have different dads\
  \ and his dad is my step dad. Hes a great guy and I'm so glad my mom found him.\
  \ But ever since my little brother was young I've called him \"my little monkey\"\
  \ because hes a pro at outdoor jungle gyms. He hangs onto the bars like an actual\
  \ monkey, and it's something my grandma used to call me as well. I've always found\
  \ it cute and sweet until I was at the park with him earlier and there were a bunch\
  \ of snobby white moms with their kids there. My brother was doing his thing on\
  \ the bars you hold onto and he was hanging upside down and everything on them,\
  \ and I said \"you ready lil monkey?\" And one of the mothers there gasped loud\
  \ enough for me to hear and said \"you cannot call him that\". And I was like, confused?\
  \ And I asked her why. She said \"because that's racist!\" And it took a minute\
  \ but I understood why she thought I was racist I suppose because of the awful stereotype\
  \ that white people make/say about black people. Anyway, I told her \"that's just\
  \ what we have always called him in my family\". She rolled her eyes and didnt say\
  \ anything else. Anyway, we left. When arriving back to my mom and step dads house\
  \ I told them what happened. I asked my step dad if I should stop and he said no,\
  \ we all call him that and it isnt meant in that way at all. Which is true, we all\
  \ do call him that.\n\nBut I still feel bad.  Should I just call him something else?\
  \ I never thought of it in a racial way at all. \nAITA?"
