selftext: "Wife and I upset my mum for not following some pretty straightforward instructions.\n\
  \nWe asked our mum to look after our daughter who is 14 months old for an evening\
  \ at our house. \n\nWe told her that bedtime was 7pm - if she wasn\u2019t too tired\
  \ she could go to bed at 7.30. \n\nRoutine for bed is put her in her room with the\
  \ music playing and give her a dummy - she\u2019ll go to sleep not long after -\
  \ we do this every night with a really good success rate - she generally sleeps\
  \ until 6.30-7.00 am the next day. \n\nAnyway - we have a camera in her room that\
  \ allows us to play music when she goes to bed. My wife and I checked this at 7.30pm\
  \ to see how she was going and she wasn\u2019t in bed. Her dummies were still in\
  \ same place. \n\nWe figured that my mum was making the most of the time together\
  \ and was still hanging out. \n\nWe checked half an hour later and still nothing\
  \ and again at 8.15. \n\nI sent her message and asked her \u201CHow\u2019s it going?\u201D\
  . To which we didn\u2019t get a reply. \n\nWe were due home at 10, so we left where\
  \ we were and drove home at 9.30. I checked my phone, still no message and still\
  \ not in bed. \n\nBut then on the camera mum comes in and is trying to hastily rock\
  \ my daughter to sleep. \n\nMy daughter is overtired by this stage and fighting\
  \ it. She\u2019s been up way too long. \n\nI receive a message at 9.45 that says\
  \ \u201CShe just went to sleep\u201D. \n\nWe get home at 10.00 - walk inside and\
  \ I asked my mum what happened. \n\nShe said that she tried to put her to sleep\
  \ at 8.00 but she wasn\u2019t tired. She also said that she was just trying to comfort\
  \ her before bed. \n\nI went to check my daughter. While I was in the next room.\
  \ My mum asked my wife how her evening was - my wife who is halfway through her\
  \ second pregnancy was pretty annoyed and said that she was stressed checking the\
  \ camera and seeing no effort made to go to bed at our daughters bedtime. \n\nMy\
  \ mum responded by saying \u201Cthat\u2019s how I raised my kids\u201D.\n\nMy wife\
  \ told her that our daughter isn\u2019t her kid to do that too. \n\nMy mum left\
  \ and she pissed. She sent me message saying that she was hurt and made to feel\
  \ she did thing by trying to do things her way. \n\nI told her that by not following\
  \ our routine she\u2019s undermined us as parents. \n\nShe then used the \u201C\
  but you turned out okay\u201D card. (Which I probably kinda didn\u2019t). \n\n\n\
  Am I (and my wife) the assholes for telling my mum she shouldn\u2019t have kept\
  \ our kid up so late and not following our instructions?"
