selftext: "AITA for walking away from the dinner table after my grandfather, mother,\
  \ and elderly father all started telling me that I need to make sure that my elderly\
  \ father\u2019s A1C doesn\u2019t go above 6? \n\nSome context: my father is old\
  \ and he is a type 2 diabetic. His A1C is about 9 now, and it\u2019s probably because\
  \ he\u2019s a functioning alcoholic and gorges himself in sweets and sweet drinks.\
  \ He takes lots of medication and insulin every morning. I remind him every day\
  \ to take his medication. (Btw I am a 18F) and I watch over him and check on him\
  \ every day to make sure he isn\u2019t pushing his limits. I tell him when it\u2019\
  s time to rest/take a nap. Or when it\u2019s time to eat lunch or dinner. I stopped\
  \ going to public school and opted to take online classes so I would be able to\
  \ take care of him better. I also go with him to all of his doctor appointments\
  \ now- or any long drives he has to go on.\n\nSuddenly I\u2019m about to get my\
  \ driver\u2019s license and graduate high school; and I\u2019ve been slacking a\
  \ little on when to remind him but that\u2019s just cause I forget too. \n\nMy grandfather\
  \ is also type 2 diabetic, he opted out of most medication and takes care of himself\
  \ via his diet. Although he shows more self restraint than my dad does. My grandfather\
  \ doesn\u2019t eat carbs.\n\nSo at the dinner table all three of them- my mother,\
  \ my grandfather, and my father, are all telling me it\u2019s my responsibility\
  \ to make dad cut down on his diet, no more carbs or beer or pasta or anything of\
  \ the sort. And it\u2019s my responsibility to make sure his A1C goes down. \n\n\
  I feel like this is too much to ask of me..I\u2019m not a caretaker or nurse and\
  \ I don\u2019t want to be one. I don\u2019t want to be stuck at home at 20 and older\
  \ taking care of my dad..I almost asked \u201Cwhy me?\u201D In front of them all..but\
  \ reminded myself that I\u2019m in front of my grandparents. Instead I said \u201C\
  I have to check on my dog\u201D and quickly left..\n\nAITA for not wanting to take\
  \ care of my dad for the rest of his or my life? For walking out during dinner?\n\
  \n\nEdit: I had no idea this would blow up so quick! I am trying my best to read\
  \ everything, all of you are so amazing! So here are some answers to some commonly\
  \ asked questions:\nHow old is dad? He\u2019s around 59-61 and he is my step dad.\
  \ | Why doesn\u2019t mom help? She prefers to travel for work, leaving for 2 weeks\
  \ at a time, and staying for a week or more and then going again. | Do I get paid?\
  \ No | Why isn\u2019t there a professional caregiver? I assumed it was because we\
  \ couldn\u2019t afford it when they turned down my idea the first time, I\u2019\
  m going to try again though. | Is my father mentally impaired? I want to say no,\
  \ but he suffered 2 strokes that had impaired his ability to do normal things in\
  \ a timely fashion, or remember simple things (hence why I go to the doctors office\
  \ with him). |\n\nUpdate: it\u2019s been a few days since I posted, and I\u2019\
  m thankful for everyone who responded. I think I\u2019ve read them all and I\u2019\
  m so blessed to be able to have so many people speaking from experience to guide\
  \ and warn me. So this is what has happened. Mom is now off traveling somewhere\
  \ so it\u2019s just dad and I. Today while he and I were folding some laundry I\
  \ spoke up about my concerns and feelings. I expressed that at the dinner table\
  \ it felt like the three of them were really expecting me to take care of him..and\
  \ although it might have been a joke to him it didn\u2019t feel like mother was\
  \ joking- and maybe grandfather was half expecting me to actually start acting like\
  \ a nurse. I told him that I don\u2019t mind reminding him each day about his medication;\
  \ it\u2019s the least I could do..but I asked him if he really expected me to start\
  \ being responsible for his diet; to which he responded with something along the\
  \ lines of \u201Cno, I would never really ask you to do that\u201D\n\nWe got to\
  \ talking more, and I mentioned that I will be going away in a year or more for\
  \ college or to be getting a full time job, and I will not be around every day to\
  \ help him..so I told him that he should seriously consider looking into the VA\
  \ for a caregiver. I was surprised to find out that this was not the first time\
  \ he and my mother had spoken of hiring one. Apparently if we had lived in an apartment..and\
  \ not with Osean, it would have been likely that we would\u2019ve had a caregiver\
  \ for him. And my mother and him are in fact anticipating my eventual moving out\
  \ (by talking about what they want to do with my room). I think it is likely that\
  \ in the near future; they will hire a caregiver. My dad even suggested that when\
  \ I have a full time job I could pay some form of rent so that I might help pay\
  \ for it. This was honestly one of the best outcomes. I don\u2019t think I would\u2019\
  ve gotten here without this amazing support group from reddit. Communication in\
  \ a calm, and honest way really is key to living life as best as possible; even\
  \ if it means being vulnerable about the things you fear. Thank you all."
