selftext: "For context, my mother and father divorced over 20 years ago. They did\
  \ not have a good relationship and I believe that my mother still suffers mentally\
  \ from their marriage, divorce, and child custody battle. I know that my father\
  \ put her down a lot and dragged her through the mud (very publically too.) \n\n\
  In July, my father passed away very suddenly and very quickly. It was an absolute\
  \ shock to everyone. Funeral arrangements were quickly made and my mother called\
  \ my step-mother to ask if it would be okay if she attended the funeral. My step-mother\
  \ said it was fine, she can even sit up the front in the family section to be with\
  \ us kids if she'd like to. (Also context, me and my two older siblings are all\
  \ in 20s.) \n\nNow, at the funeral my mother felt she didn't need to sit with us\
  \ but sat toward the back of the church. The funeral was fine, we marched him out\
  \ to the car (he was being cremated, not buried) and then we all went back inside\
  \ to have refreshments and talk about him, I guess? \n\nSo, during the refreshments,\
  \ I went into the bathroom and while I was in the stall I could hear two women chatting\
  \ about why my mother was there. Talking about how she had no right to be there,\
  \ how would my step-mother feel about it, and that she doesn't belong. I finished\
  \ up my business, walked out to the sink area where they were standing, and said,\
  \ \"you need to shut the fuck up about my mother and mind your own fucking business.\"\
  \ \n\nI left the bathroom in disgust, went to the pub with my siblings, and had\
  \ a beer to celebrate the life my father lived. \n\nThe funeral happened back in\
  \ July but I recently ran into one of the women I berated and she told me that she\
  \ didn't say anything at the funeral because she knew I was upset about my father\
  \ but that she now feels like she's owed an apology because I \"unreasonably rude\"\
  \ I told her that I had nothing to apologise for and that if she wanted to gossip\
  \ about my mother, she should have done it after she left the funeral. She was a\
  \ bit rude and insisted she said nothing wrong, she was just voicing an opinion.\
  \ I asked her if she'd like to voice those opinions to my mother and she shut her\
  \ mouth and walked off. \n\nSo, Reddit, was I being an Asshole?"
title: AITA for telling someone to shut the fuck up about why my mother was at my
  father's funeral and refusing to apologise?
