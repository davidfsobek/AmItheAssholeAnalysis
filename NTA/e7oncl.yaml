selftext: "This is our first year in our new home and we live on a culdesac with only\
  \ one neighbor next to us. \nWe go all out on Xmas decorations and lights. Like\
  \ RIP our electric bill going all out. We have almost half an acre of front yard\
  \ alone and it\u2019s covered.\nWe enjoy doing this and don\u2019t do it for any\
  \ other reason than us just enjoying it. We do have random people driving to come\
  \ see the lights though. It\u2019s not something that we ask for or encourage, it\
  \ just happens. It doesn\u2019t bother me though in the slightest, I\u2019m glad\
  \ people like our lights.\n\nMy neighbor has an issue with this. He doesn\u2019\
  t like so many random cars always coming by early evening. It doesn\u2019t really\
  \ last all night, but we probably get 30-40 cars come and drive by real slow or\
  \ stop for a few min and take pics.\nHe also says he is a very strong atheist and\
  \ doesn\u2019t appreciate the xmas lights. He said he\u2019s fine with a moderate\
  \ amount but that this is overboard and has asked us to tone it down.\n\nWe really\
  \ don\u2019t want to. We bought our house and we keep everything on our property\
  \ line. I know it sounds kind of dickish but I don\u2019t know.\n\nEdit. I know\
  \ Atheism is not a religion. I think he is just trying to use anything he can or\
  \ try to seem offended because he doesn\u2019t like the lights or the cars.\n\n\
  The lights go on at 6pm and go off at 10pm. We have a decently high electric bill,\
  \ but we do get help from our solar panels. We try to be conservative throughout\
  \ the year and watch or electric and water. Hence the panels. We do our part to\
  \ stay green with many aspects but no one is perfect.\n\nThe side street we are\
  \ on is just me and him. We both have around 3 acres each so we are not on top of\
  \ each other. We both have a lot of and space between us."
