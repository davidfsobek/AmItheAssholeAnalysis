selftext: "I'm not sure where to start on this one. When I turned 18 my mom told me\
  \ I needed to start paying rent or move out, fair enough. The problem was she asked\
  \ for 'fair value' and it was more than I could pay working the hours I did. \n\n\
  I was dealing with some physical and mental health issues, plus I was still in high\
  \ school. I did manage to pay what she asked, but school and my health suffered\
  \ a bit because of it. If I got sick and had to stay in the hospital for a week\
  \ or so, I had to pick up double shifts at work the next week to still be able to\
  \ pay. It was very stressful. 35ish hours a week spend in school, 25ish hours a\
  \ week for work. \n\nI took a year off between high school and college to work,\
  \ I couldn't save any money to move out while also going to school. I was able to\
  \ move out and start college. \n\nNow I'm in my final year of college, and my mom\
  \ needs a place to stay for two months (the time between selling her old house and\
  \ being able to move into her new one). She asked if she could stay with me, and\
  \ I told her yes, if she pays rent. \n\nI thought that's more than fair. She's an\
  \ adult with a full time job. I was a teen in high school. I'm even asking for less\
  \ than I paid back then (1/2 of my rent, I thought that was fair). Hell, we weren't\
  \ even tight on money when I had to pay, it was to 'teach me responsibility'.\n\n\
  She thinks it's rude I even asked, called me a bad daughter, and entitled. Some\
  \ other family members agree with her, about not asking family for rent. But since\
  \ they don't know the full story I thought I'd ask here. \n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: I can't\
  \ afford to let her stay for free, if that matters. I can barely buy groceries as\
  \ is, let alone for another person. Plus utilities."
