selftext: "I\u2019m a nurse (lvn) at a huge state psych hospital. A lot of the buildings\
  \ on campus are from the 1800s and have been condemned, but even the newer (1960s,\
  \ 70s) buildings where they currently keep patients are set up strange. \n\nOn our\
  \ unit, there are two bathrooms available to staff that are located in the two (very\
  \ small) nurses stations. It is an unwritten rule that if you have to evict some\
  \ squatters, you leave the (locked) unit and use the restroom at the front of the\
  \ building. So that\u2019s the setup. Here\u2019s the scene:\n\nYesterday I was\
  \ about halfway through my 16 hour shift when I decided to take a break and walk\
  \ around campus for a few minutes. A couple of times per shift I\u2019ll usually\
  \ take a walk, smoke a cigarette, use the restroom and then resume my position in\
  \ the medication room. I had finished my walk and realized I had to pee, so I went\
  \ into the nurses station where the RN hibernates and went to the restroom. I THOUGHT\
  \ I only had to pee, but I soon felt the all-too-familiar sensation of a big, mean\
  \ dookie sneaking up on me. So I busted a grumpy, washed my hands, went back to\
  \ the med room and didn\u2019t think anything of it. \n\nFast forward a couple of\
  \ hours maybe, the RN knocked on the door to the med room and came in. She seemed\
  \ uncomfortable but I assumed her visit had something to do with a patient. I was\
  \ wrong. She explained to me that some of the staff were complaining about me having\
  \ a \u201Cbowel movement\u201D in the nurses station, as it is a courtesy that we\
  \ do that in the bathroom in the front of the building. I couldn\u2019t help but\
  \ start laughing. It seemed too ridiculous to even respond to, but I did. I told\
  \ her that it wasn\u2019t my intention to have a bowel movement in the nurses station\
  \ bathroom earlier, but sometimes it can\u2019t be helped. I thought that would\
  \ be the end of it, but she wouldn\u2019t let it go. She kept repeating the part\
  \ about courtesy and how it\u2019s an unwritten rule. So after a couple of times\
  \ of telling her it wasn\u2019t intentional, I told her something to the tune of,\
  \ \u201CListen, if we\u2019re going to talk about my bathroom habits, let\u2019\
  s talk about them. I thought I just had to take a piss. Turns out I had to shit\
  \ too. Maybe I should\u2019ve wiped my twat, pulled up my pants, washed my hands,\
  \ walked to the front of the building, unlocked the two locked doors to get out/in,\
  \ and took a shit there. But it made more sense at the time to take a shit on the\
  \ toilet I was already sitting on.\u201D \n\nI also told her that in the future\
  \ if I have to shit, I\u2019m going to shit in whichever bathroom I see fit. She\
  \ was appalled, and said we just needed to drop the conversation. Fine by me. \n\
  \nGranted, I was much more crass than I needed to be, but at the time it felt like\
  \ it was warranted. AITA?\n\nEdit: I\u2019m not sure why this isn\u2019t coming\
  \ across, but I did NOT go into the bathroom planning to shit. I\u2019m hoping it\u2019\
  s men who keep saying I made a deliberate choice to shit in that bathroom, because\
  \ women know good and damn well that sometimes when you SIT DOWN to pee, you suddenly\
  \ get the urge to drop anchor.\n\nEdit2: I am well aware that I can be an asshole\
  \ in general on the regular. The question was whether or not I was the asshole in\
  \ this particular situation. Y\u2019all have tickled the shit out of me with your\
  \ comments though, so thanks for that."
