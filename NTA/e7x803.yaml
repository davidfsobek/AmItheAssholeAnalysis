selftext: 'I work with clients and my job basically boils down to answering their
  questions and keeping them happy. Every 3 months, we hold meetings with their reps.


  We have an employee that has it all. Pink and platinum-blond highlights, a nose
  ring, and tattoos all over her body from the neck down. She wears heavy amounts
  of make-up and basically looks like a punk. She also wears a tank top that exposes
  her midriff and her straps. She sits near the office entrance and is one of the
  first people you see on your way in.


  She''s been with us for the past 8 months and every single time, without fail, I
  notice our clients'' reps (from different companies) all give her weird looks. I''ve
  even seen them rolling their eyes at her. The last straw was from my latest meeting
  where the rep outright said "Wow you hire just about anybody here, huh?" and he
  jerks his head towards her desk at the front. I try to laugh it off and say "Good
  help is hard to find." He just raises his eyebrows and mutters "She must be damn
  good at her job."


  After he left, I went to talk to the girl''s manager about enforcing the dress code
  and how it''s making our business look bad. Our office dress code is simple: business
  casual, no facial piercings (therefore earrings are okay), and no facial tattoos
  (I actually had to look that up). It doesn''t say anything about make-up but none
  of the other women in the office have the goth/punk look either. Her manager promised
  he''d talk to her about it.


  A week later, I hear back that things have escalated. The girl in question adamantly
  refuses to adhere to the dress code and has fired back about the issue by claiming
  discrimination. I hear they don''t want to fire her, but they also don''t like hearing
  me tell them that our clients'' reps have an issue with who we hire and how they
  present themselves.


  I don''t want her to be fired, but I also don''t want her attire and appearance
  to detract from my work. Her manager is hoping she''ll calm down after a while and
  conform to the dress code, because if not, and if his patience runs out, she''s
  probably going to get the boot.


  EDIT for more INFO: I''m not her manager, her manager is her manager (who should''ve
  fixed this a long time ago). I made the complaint about her attire when my clients
  went from just rolling their eyes about it to a verbal complaint. I also don''t
  know how she looked for the interview, I wasn''t the one who interviewed her. We
  work in separate departments.'
