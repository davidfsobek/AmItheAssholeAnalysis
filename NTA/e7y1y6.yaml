selftext: "Context: SHE'S PISSED! \n\nMy 18 year old best friend has what I would\
  \ describe baby fever. She wants to have a baby really badly. She asked me my opinion\
  \ and I was horrified that she would even ask me or need my opinion on this. I was\
  \ not rude and I wasn't jumping for joy and I think she whole heartedly thinks this\
  \ is the way to go. \n\nShe just started dating her boyfriend a month ago. She already\
  \ wants to marry him and have kids with him. And she wants the kids first. Shes\
  \ trying to get pregnant. She says her plan is to get pregnant and move into the\
  \ manufactured home her boyfriends parents are gifting him. \n\nShe is super big\
  \ on her appearance and its extremely important to her. If she gets one zit she\
  \ has a breakdown. I tell her \"but what about your body? Are you sure you want\
  \ to do this so young?\"\n\nShe seriously looks me in the eye and says her body\
  \ will go back to exactly the way it is and nothing will change. This is when I\
  \ gave her an incredulous look and she got mad at me and called me a bad friend\
  \ for not supporting her and that I'm ignorant to how pregnancy works. \n\nI may\
  \ be young but I know for a fact that theres no way shes gonna look the same after\
  \ she has a baby, considering she's short like I am as well. I told her that if\
  \ she wants to have kids, that's her prerogative but I don't really want to have\
  \ kids because I also care about the way my body and appearance is. She calls me\
  \ selfish and that I'll regret not having kids someday. I just want dogs though.\
  \ Anyway this isn't the point. \n\nShe thinks that by having a baby it will fix\
  \ her life. She will stop doing drugs, smoking cigarettes, drinking and get a place\
  \ to live. I told her she should do all that first and not after.\n\nShe says I'm\
  \ an asshole and I should support her yet she doesn't support me not having kids.\
  \ This chick turned off her fake baby in high school, how is she gonna handle a\
  \ real one? This is serious stuff"
