selftext: "So my daughter was born 2 years ago, I had a very good pregnancy but develop\
  \ gestational diabetes at 32 weeks (due to me being overweight I was checking my\
  \ sugar levels every other day). Due to this my OBGYN schedule a cesarean I didn\u2019\
  t have any issues with this I just wanted my baby to be born safely.\nSo before\
  \ going in to the hospital I talked with my husband that if something where to happened\
  \ and he needed to choose between myself and our baby to please choose me. He got\
  \ quiet but said that he agreed and that please let me mother know about what we\
  \ talked.\n\nEverything went according to plan and both of us where completely fine.\n\
  \nNow fast forward to now trying for number two and in a Christmas party with my\
  \ girlfriends the topic was brought up about babys. There\u2019s another friend\
  \ that is also trying so the topic of conversation was on that for a good hour.\n\
  \nWhen my friend ask me that if I was ready for another 9 months of pregnancy and\
  \ how I felt. I answer truthfully cause honestly I was just letting all the fears\
  \ and doubts go.\n\nI said that I do want another baby and that pregnancy doesn\u2019\
  t scare me such as giving birth again. I said that I straight told my husband again\
  \ that I\u2019m scared that something may happened to me during the birth and in\
  \ the hopes of giving my daughter a sibling I could leave her without a mother.\
  \ That the original agreement stands that he needs to choose me if that\u2019s the\
  \ case.\n\nMy friends where disgusted with my thinking and said that i was an asshole\
  \ to my husband in asking him to basically kill his baby (those where the exact\
  \ words), that I was a very negative person and that I needed to rethink my thoughts.\
  \ I\u2019m a person that likes to be prepared for the worse case scenario and hope\
  \ for the best. I didn\u2019t want my husband to be blindsided with who to choose\
  \ and to have the answer on the spot. Nobody likes to think in what could go wrong\
  \ specially in a pregnancy but I need to think every possible case that we could\
  \ encounter. \n\nSo Reddit AITA!?\n\nEdit: so this blew up, just to clarify some\
  \ points\n\n1-English is not my first language \n\n2-I say Christmas party but this\
  \ was at a friends house every year we ( work friends, 8 people) meet to celebrate\
  \ the end of the year we talk about everything. I have yet to talk to them since\
  \ this happened I didn\u2019t want to create a scene. It did affect me that they\
  \ think I\u2019m such a negative person but I will talk with them.\n\n3- yes I\u2019\
  m overweight and I had an almost perfect pregnancy.  People telling me to loose\
  \ some weight before having another baby, thank you! I didn\u2019t though of that\
  \ before how enlightening! Also why do people want to know how much I weight? If\
  \ you don\u2019t know GD can affect any woman that is not overweight yes you have\
  \ a better chance to have it but not only overweight woman develop it.\n\n4- yes\
  \ I know this scenario is not a likely one anymore due to the advances in medicine,\
  \ but giving birth is a serious things, so many things can go wrong in an instant\
  \ an I wanted to be prepared for it.\n\n5- my thinking was, if something happened\
  \ to us (me and baby) and my husband had to choose, either way his decision will\
  \ be judge by my family. \nWhat if I died and he had to tell my parents sorry but\
  \ I choose  the baby. \nThat\u2019s why he asked me to tell my mom of what we had\
  \ agree to.\nWhen the conversation was brought up my husband said he thought the\
  \ same thing, he asked himself what would he do in that case and said that he was\
  \ feeling awful cause he knew he wanted to save me but didn\u2019t know how to tell\
  \ me.  \nSo my husband wasn\u2019t force or I made the decision for him. Also we\
  \ did talked about if I end up in a ventilator or coma or anything like that I left\
  \ instructions.\n\n6- this is not a pro-life click bait or anything related to that.\n\
  \n7- people don\u2019t like to think about the bad stuff during pregnancy but the\
  \ risks for the mother are massive, your body goes under so much. It also takes\
  \ a mental toll on you. \n\n8- also people that are saying that if I\u2019m not\
  \ prepared to die for my baby I shouldn\u2019t be a mother are TA. \n\n\n9- just\
  \ some facts for you  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,\
  \ 700 women die in childbirth every year, and over 50,000 more nearly die, experiencing\
  \ \u201Csevere maternal morbidity,\u201D most often due to complications from severe\
  \ bleeding. \n\nThank you reddit!"
