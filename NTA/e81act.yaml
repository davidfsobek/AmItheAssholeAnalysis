selftext: 'I recently caught my girlfriend cheating. Part of it involved me seeing
  their text messages. He was well aware of our relationship. Not that it matters,
  but out of our 12 month relationship they were hooking up for 11 months.


  One of the screenshots shared some sensitive work information. I forwarded it to
  his boss and it seems it got him fired. This wasn''t some master plan. I woke up
  this morning and the idea just came to me.


  My email was just a "look at this." And they made their own decision. In the end,
  he was sharing information he was not supposed too.



  Half my friends said I was being petty and I shouldn''t have done it. The others
  said he had it coming.


  Edit: It was patient (healthcare) related information.

  Edit2; I am not sure if I can add this but something happened to me today that kind
  of cleared things up for me. I got a flat tire. A total stranger helped me. He had
  no responsibility to help me, but he did anyway. Up to know, I partially felt my
  EX-gf''s lover had no responsibility towards me. But I think he does have a responsibly
  to the greater good of "Don''t be a dick". He was a dick.'
