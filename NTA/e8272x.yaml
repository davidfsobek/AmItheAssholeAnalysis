selftext: "Aita: my husband has a bad habit of leaving his leather wallet in his pants.\
  \ I inevitably ruin his wallet. I devised a \u201Csystem,\u201D so I thought. I\
  \ got a hamper system, and I talked with him about clothes not going in it till\
  \ they were ready to be washed. (I will admit, I used to have a problem with pens\
  \ and notes in my pockets). Well, our washer broke, so I loaded up all the clothes\
  \ in the hamper and trekked over to my in laws to wash clothes in the process, his\
  \ wallet was in his pants and got ruined... third one this year. He is upset with\
  \ me that I didn\u2019t check the pockets before washing, I am upset he didn\u2019\
  t abide by the \u201Cempty your pockets before putting things in the hamper,\u201D\
  \ rule. He swears he never talked about this because he thinks it is silly not to\
  \ check before putting them in the machine... I think it\u2019s ridiculous to check\
  \ the multitude of pockets in his pants for something he might have left when we\
  \ are doing laundry for a family of 5.\n\nTLDR: check pockets before doing laundry\
  \ or empty pockets before putting them in the hamper??"
