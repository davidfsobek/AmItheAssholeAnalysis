selftext: "I've started biking to my job, to the gym, to pretty much everywhere to\
  \ get in shape. \n\nIt's been mostly great, I've lost a bunch of weight and gotten\
  \ a lot stronger too. \n\nBut the one stressful thing is how drivers around here\
  \ aren't great... Lots of dumb driving, speeding, road rage, texting, etc... And\
  \ I've had a couple close calls.\n\nJust a month ago for example, I was driving\
  \ on a 2 lane road, in the right lane. People in the right lane are allowed to turn\
  \ right or go straight. People in the left lane are allowed to turn left or go straight.\n\
  \nWell, a guy in a SUV took a right turn from the left lane, and nearly hit me from\
  \ the side. And that's just one example of dumb driving.\n\nI always try to avoid\
  \ those situations from the start, and evade them if I see them happening. But sometimes\
  \ something takes me by surprise.\n\nI can't really honk because I'm on a bike,\
  \ and nobody in a car is going to hear a bike Bell. I also don't want to scream\
  \ angrily because I'm afraid someone might react bad to that and hurt me. \n\nSo\
  \ if a close call happens, I just scream as loud and high as I can. No words, just\
  \ AAAAAA. Like \"girl getting murdered in a horror movie\" like banshee style shriek.\
  \ \n\nI've got a real high voice and great projection. I was a soprano in my school's\
  \ choir and I can belt it. And every time I've done that, whoever was driving slams\
  \ the breaks or slows way down to look around. \n\nI never thought there was much\
  \ trouble with that; I gotta do something to keep myself safe. But then yesterday\
  \ I was going to work and someone in a pickup truck ran a stop sign and had a close\
  \ call with me. So I swerved and shrieked, and kept shrieking till the driver had\
  \ fully stopped. He seemed spooked. \n\nThen I saw some of my coworkers on the sidewalk,\
  \ they were going to get coffee together, and they waved me over and asked if I\
  \ was OK, what had just happened.\n\nI was like \"yeah I'm good, just didn't wanna\
  \ get run over and needed that truck to see or hear me\" and they were like \"girl\
  \ everyone in a half mile radius heard you\"\n\nI was kinda joking around and went\
  \ \"Thank the finest vocal training at (my hometown) Junior high\" \n\nAnd a couple\
  \ of my coworkers said it wasn't that funny, I'd given them a scare and probably\
  \ everyone else in earshot too.\n\nAITA for screaming when I have close calls on\
  \ my bike? It's more to draw drivers attention than out of genuine horror or pain."
