selftext: "I (21m) have a three year old daughter. Her mother is not in the picture.\
  \ The ex in question (Kate) is a girl I dated for a year and a half, starting when\
  \ my daughter was three months old. \n\nMy ex is a lovely person, she does a lot\
  \ for charity, works with animals, and is doing a degree. This was the case, until\
  \ she developed anorexia. This post is not about my ex's eatng disorder, but about\
  \ how she has been acting with my daughter since we split up. \n\nWe split up just\
  \ over a year ago, and since then my ex has been seeing my daughter at weekends,\
  \ like a parent would do, as she has helped to raise my daughter since she was a\
  \ baby, and in all ways except legally, she is my daughter's mother. Kate is a great\
  \ mom, but her eating disorder is getting in the way of her life. When she first\
  \ got diagnosed she was acting almost as normal, but things have just been getting\
  \ worse. She is in therapy privately and sees her therapist twice a week. She has\
  \ been in inpatient treatment twice, but it's just getting worse. I fear the worst\
  \ for her if things don't change very soon. She is 5'4 and from my guesses, weighs\
  \ about 80lbs. \n\nMy daughter has become conscious of her weight. She is THREE.\
  \ She came home the other day and said that she doesn't want to eat bread anymore,\
  \ and that she wants cucumber with ketchup instead of pizza. Three years old. I\
  \ can't believe it. I asked her why she doesn't want to eat bread, and she said\
  \ 'Katie said it makes you chunky'. I asked her what's wrong with being chunky,\
  \ and she said it's 'yacky'. I was horrified.\n\nI called Kate and asked what happened.\
  \ She told me that she was having a particularly hard day when she said that and\
  \ that she is sorry. I stupidly forgave her, because I know how hard this has been\
  \ for her. She went back to Kate's for the weekend and when she came back, she said\
  \ 'I want to be like Katie when I grow up' and I asked why, she said because Kate\
  \ is pretty and skinny. I called Kate again. She said it was another hard day. I\
  \ told her that she needs to get her 'hard days' under control and away from our\
  \ kid because it's unacceptable and I won't let her influence her. Kate cried and\
  \ said our daughter is the only thing keeping her sane, and I told her that that's\
  \ her problem. AITA?"
title: AITA for telling my ex girlfriend that I don't want her around my daughter
  anymore because of her body image/behaviour?
