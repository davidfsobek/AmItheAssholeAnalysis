selftext: "Simply put, this has happened three times now, where I\u2019m the only\
  \ one in my department\u2019s computer lab at my university, and the same guy has\
  \ come and sat to work at the computer right next to mine. This computer lab specially\
  \ has around 20 computers. And in these three instances, every single computer,\
  \ except for mine, wasn\u2019t being used. In other words, I would be the ONLY person\
  \ in the lab, except for when he came in.\n\nIt really doesn\u2019t make any sense;\
  \ the first time he did it, I thought he was going to talk to me/hit on me, but\
  \ he stayed totally silent. And then the OTHER time he did this, he stayed totally\
  \ silent. The second time, I moved to a different computer in the lab. I don\u2019\
  t know if *he* doesn\u2019t get social cues, but what he had been doing, started\
  \ making me feel uncomfortable.\n\nSo, when this happened again, as he was starting\
  \ to sit down next to me, I simply said to him, \u201CHey, I\u2019m sorry, but is\
  \ there a reason why you have sat next to me for three times in a row now when it\u2019\
  s just been us two, when we basically have the whole computer lab to ourselves?\u201D\
  \n\nHe said, \u201CUh I don\u2019t know, I haven\u2019t really noticed, I\u2019\
  m sorry why?\u201D\n\nI said, \u201CI\u2019m sorry but there\u2019s no way you could\
  \ have not noticed. This has happened when I was the only one in here. I\u2019ll\
  \ be honest what you\u2019ve been doing, even if you think you haven\u2019t been\
  \ paying attention, has made me really uncomfortable.\u201D\n\nHe said, \u201CChill,\
  \ I\u2019m not trying to hit on you or anything.\u201D\n\nI said, \u201CI\u2019\
  m sorry but it almost comes across as stalking.\u201D\n\nHe said, \u201CWhat the\
  \ fuck? I wasn\u2019t stalking you, calm down I haven\u2019t done anything wrong.\u201D\
  \n\nI packed up my stuff and went to a different computer lab on campus.\n\nI was\
  \ justified in what I said, right?\n\ntl;dr in three separate instances, I\u2019\
  ve been the only one in my department\u2019s computer lab, when this guy would come\
  \ in and sit and work at the computer right next to mine. I made him aware of what\
  \ he was doing, from my viewpoint. AITA?\n\nEDIT: This question has come up a lot:\
  \ \u201CWas I in the same seat all three times?\u201D No, I wasn\u2019t; I was in\
  \ a different seat every time, and he still sat next to me.\n\n2nd EDIT: I\u2019\
  ve been temporarily banned for I guess what was a mean comment I made, you\u2019\
  re welcome to message me and I\u2019d be happy to clarify anything."

  would sit next to me in the computer lab?
