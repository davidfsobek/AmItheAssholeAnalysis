selftext: "So me and my fianc\xE9 been tight on money. Like super tonight. We both\
  \ have had major car issues in the last two months. His car is undrivable. Our insurance\
  \ is gonna cover most of the cost. Leaving us with a 1000 dollar deductible. For\
  \ us, that is a ton of money that neither of us have. Worst time for this to happen.\
  \ Another thing. My fianc\xE9 just got the flu. And it hit him hard. He got sent\
  \ home from work today, after just getting there. \n\nKnowing that neither of us\
  \ can afford it, I have tried to get a loan for the bills. I managed to get a small\
  \ loan that\u2019ll cover half the deductible, and get us groceries for the month.\
  \ It was supposed to come in today, so I was going to Walmart for groceries. I checked\
  \ my account when I got in there and realized I had a grand total of 80 dollars\
  \ in my account. The loan still hasn\u2019t come in. Great. Well I should be able\
  \ to get enough for a few days. \n\nI grabbed a day/nightquil package and some midol\
  \ (since the red devil has decided to cause me unjust pain) and that alone was 25\
  \ bucks. Wtf Walmart. I grabbed the cheapest things I could find, enough for at\
  \ least three dinners and some small lunches. Grand total 60 bucks. \n\nI told my\
  \ fianc\xE9 we would need to run to the dollar tree for a couple of things. And\
  \ while I was in there he texted me he needed to use the restroom. I finished my\
  \ shopping and sat waiting in the car. After 10-15 minutes he comes back with a\
  \ wayback burger bag. I\u2019m slightly annoyed that he bought food after we got\
  \ groceries. But fine. One less meal I need to make today (he asked if I could make\
  \ soup tonight, and that\u2019s gonna take a bit) it was also lunch time and I figured\
  \ if I was hungry, he was probably super hungry being sick.\n\nHe eats some of his\
  \ fries and then pulls out the cheesiest grilled ham and cheese sandwich I\u2019\
  ve ever seen. I was a little confused he didn\u2019t give me a sandwich, and he\
  \ ate about half before lookin at me and offering me a bite. Cheese makes my stomach\
  \ hurt, a lot. And I also hate the taste of it. I told him I couldn\u2019t eat that,\
  \ and he motioned to the bag with more food in his mouth. I looked, all that was\
  \ left was his fries he hadn\u2019t finished. \n\nI was and still am kinda hurt\
  \ he didn\u2019t think that I might be hungry. Especially since I just bought groceries\
  \ with what little money I have left. He\u2019s picked up on my mood, and has asked\
  \ why I \u201Clook so mean\u201D I just have been ignoring it and put him to bed.\
  \ \n\nam I the asshole here? Or do I have the right to be upset about this?\nTLDR/Annoyed\
  \ that fianc\xE9 didn\u2019t get me food after I just bought groceries for food\
  \ that he requested\n\n*edit. I never expect him to get me food. But when we're\
  \ both out together it would be nice if he thought about both of us\n\n*edit 2.\
  \ I will definitely be talking to him about how I feel, and about the loan. As soon\
  \ as he's a little better and off the nyquil that he's sleeping off I thank you\
  \ for all the helpful responses\n\n*edit 3. He said that he got the fries for me\
  \ (that he ate most of them. Before even touching his sandwhich) he said he's sorry"
