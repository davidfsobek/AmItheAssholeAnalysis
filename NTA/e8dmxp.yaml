selftext: "Last month I was in a hit and run, the only accident I've had in 12 years\
  \ of driving.  The other driver was eventually found and 100% at fault. I missed\
  \ one day of work the day after the accident.\n\nThis morning I had a sudden, severe\
  \ muscle spasm, lost my balance and fell hard. I hit my head, had amnesia, have\
  \ large bruises. Obviously went to the ER via ambulance and did not go into work\
  \ today either. After returning home, I Facetimed my mom. Her first response was,\
  \ \"I hope you don't get fired.\" This was not unexpected, she catastrophizes often,\
  \ but without even a preface about if I'm okay, medical prognosis, etc., really\
  \ pissed me off. I said goodbye and then hung up.\n\nI\u2019ve always had excellent\
  \ work attendance. I own my home, am in part-time grad school, and consider myself\
  \ to be doing pretty damn good. I've had four jobs in the past 2 years, but no employment\
  \ gaps. I resigned on good terms with glowing references, each was to accept a much\
  \ better offer and doubled my salary in 2 years. My parents think it\u2019s too\
  \ many jobs, they're the \"stick it out\" types, thinking loyalty is rewarded, when\
  \ this isn\u2019t how today\u2019s job market functions.\n\nWe've spoken about similar\
  \ comments made in the past. Occasionally she apologizes, sometimes argues, always\
  \ claims she \"can't help it.\" I tell her that's simply not true, try having more\
  \ empathy or just keep inconsiderate comments to herself.\n\nThey're also absent\
  \ from important events in my life. They didn't come to my college graduation, citing\
  \ a long flight and disappointment that I didn't play sports  senior year - despite\
  \ graduating from a top 10 university, highest honors, full scholarship. I'm a good\
  \ son. I give thoughtful birthday cards and gifts. Last Christmas I paid all expenses\
  \ for a European river cruise they'd been talking about. I live an hour away from\
  \ them, but immediately go over to troubleshoot any household or IT issues they\
  \ often have.\n\nI'm gay and came out in my mid-teens. They were fairly supportive,\
  \ but there's always been a subtle shame. They insist I don't comment on my sexuality\
  \ around their friends/neighbors. After 2 years of dating my now husband, I tried\
  \ to arrange a dinner for them to meet for the first time since I was considering\
  \ proposing soon. I made 5 reservations in a month and they cancelled last minute\
  \ every time. They were decent at my wedding, but it was expensive (I paid for it),\
  \ and I think their pride at the glamour of the event outweighed their shame.\n\n\
  My sister hasn't spoken to them for years for similar reasons. They have suddenly\
  \ ended several decades-long friendships, claiming themselves to have no fault whatsoever.\
  \ Neither speaks to their siblings. An obvious pattern from their toxic bullshit.\
  \ I think I\u2019m getting the worst of it now since few others are left. AITA for\
  \ seriously considering severing ties with my parents?"
