selftext: "About a month ago I bought my husband 4 boxes of cookies and one box of\
  \ cookies  for myself. I almost never buy anything just for myself. However, there\
  \ are times that I have a little bit of a sweet tooth and I would like to be able\
  \ to go into my kitchen and just eat the cookie. I buy at least three to four boxes\
  \ of cookies from my husband every week. He always eats them within a week. I asked\
  \ him specifically not to eat any of the cookies from the box that I had bought\
  \ for myself.  When I went to get a cookie from said box, the entire box was empty.\
  \  When I asked my husband about it, he laughed it off.  He told me that I was overreacting.\
  \ He said that I could just go back to the store and buy another box of cookies\
  \ and it didn't matter. He even offered to go to the store to buy a new box of cookies.\
  \  I told him that wasn\u2019t necessary and I went without.   \nThe next week,\
  \ while we were shopping we stopped By the cookie aisle and I asked my husband which\
  \ cookies he wanted to buy for this week. He told me that he didn't want any cookies.\
  \ I asked him a second and third time to be sure that he did not want cookies. Each\
  \ time he told me he did not want them. I picked one box for myself and I told him\
  \ very clearly that just because he doesn't buy his own cookies that does not mean\
  \ that he will have the ability to eat mine later.  He told me again that he didn't\
  \ want any cookies. Fine. I bought one box for myself.\n\nLater, when I had a bit\
  \ of a Sweet Craving I went into the kitchen and found the box of cookies that I\
  \ bought for myself was completely empty. He ate the entire thing within two days.\
  \  I was incredibly angry about this. Just like before, he assured me that this\
  \ would never happen again.\n\nThen, last night,  We went out for hamburgers. The\
  \ place we usually go to serves incredibly large Burger so I wasn't able to finish\
  \ all of mine. In fact, I knew from the very beginning of the meal I would be unable\
  \ to finish it also I cut the burger and half and reserved one half for later. \
  \ I specifically planned to eat it before I went to work  for the evening.   A little\
  \ while before I was scheduled to go to work, my husband walks into the room I'm\
  \ in holding the other half of my hamburger. He asked me if I wanted to eat it.\
  \ I told him, \xA8\xA8 yes, I do want to eat it put it back on the fucking table\
  \ I'm going to eat it later.\xA8\xA8 He then proceeded to eat it in front of me.\
  \ I was unable to remain calm. This felt like complete disrespect. When I confronted\
  \ him about his actions, he told me that he felt I was joking. When I asked him\
  \ to explain how it could have possibly been a joke he was unable to do so."
