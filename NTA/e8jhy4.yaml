selftext: "I will start off by admitting I can\u2019t stand my boss\u2019 husband.\
  \ It isn\u2019t so much his political ideology, but his behavior that makes me want\
  \ to vomit. \n\nHe is strongly anti-immigrant, but especially and forcefully anti-undocumented\
  \ residents. I first saw what a jack ass he is at the first company event where\
  \ he targeted service workers with questions about their legal status (he only asked\
  \ brown people, one of whom was South Asian). At another company event, he made\
  \ a point to take pictures of some of the service workers with his phone because\
  \ \u201Cthey sounded illegal\u201D and he wanted pictures in case he wanted to get\
  \ ICE involved.\n\nI don\u2019t know why my boss brings him to company functions.\
  \ He clearly makes everyone uncomfortable and I have found myself getting out of\
  \ these functions with excuses because I don\u2019t want to be around him.  But\
  \ I have a video on my phone of him approaching random Spanish-speaking people on\
  \ the streets taking pictures of them and asking them what their legal statuses\
  \ are. \n\nWIBTA if I posted the video on social media (anonymously)? He is my boss\u2019\
  \ husband, I don\u2019t want problems for my boss though..."
