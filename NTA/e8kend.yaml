selftext: "This originated about two or three months ago, or whenever that \u201C\
  kissing your homies goodnight\u201D meme was popular. My friends and I would always\
  \ joke about it, and we thought it was funny, so whenever we would hang out, we\
  \ started kissing each other goodbye. Just a short peck, nothing serious or anything.\
  \ It became sort of a tradition at the end of every hang out, and we kept doing\
  \ it even after the meme died because we still thought it was funny. Yesterday,\
  \ I brought my girlfriend to hang out with us since she had never met these friends\
  \ before. We all went to dinner, talked, and went back to one of my friend\u2019\
  s houses to watch TV. When it was time to leave, I kissed the homies, as is custom,\
  \ and said goodbye. My girlfriend was not pleased. I had told her that we did it\
  \ before, but she had assumed I wasn\u2019t serious and was just referencing the\
  \ meme. It escalated slightly, but I really don\u2019t think it\u2019s that bad.\
  \ I equate it to kissing a family member, but she thinks it\u2019s really weird.\
  \ None of us are actually gay, and there is no attraction involved whatsoever. It\
  \ might be a matter of personal opinion, but AITA?\n\nedit: yes it was on the lips,\
  \ and none of us are gay/bi"
