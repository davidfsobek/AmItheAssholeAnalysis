selftext: 'I have an elder brother who is 22  years old he has many friends who come
  over regularly. For the past few months he has had a friend who  makes me uncomfortable.
  Always askd about me ,where I am and what are you doing and I find it weird for
  a 22 year old man to be so concerned about a 16 year old girl .last week he turned
  up at my tuition right as I was coming out. One of my friends who was outside told
  me   this guy had been standing outside for 5 minutes doing nothing when I asked
  him, he said he was waiting for a friend. I doubt it.


  I basically told my brother stop talking about me to him. My brother thinks that
  I  am being ridiculous

  And that his friend is perfectly normal.


  So WIBTA if I I ask my brother to stop inviting the guy over and to stop associating
  with him?'
