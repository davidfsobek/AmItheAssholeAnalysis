selftext: "\nI am a senior in high school, I'm due to graduate in the spring. I've\
  \ been accepted to college and I really don't want anything to get in the way of\
  \ that.\n\nThis week, my homeroom teacher pulled me aside and said my parents hadn't\
  \ paid class dues for four years even though they've been reminded a lot. I had\
  \ no idea what she was talking about, my parents never said a thing to me. I thought\
  \ they'd covered all my school fees.\n\nShe said my family would have to pay or\
  \ I couldn't get my diploma. I'd been doing all the things dues covered, sports,\
  \ class trips, yearbook, dances, after school clubs, etc.\n\nI asked what was owe\
  \ and apparently dues were $120 a year. So $480 in total. I asked her if she was\
  \ sure my parents knew and she said yes, there had been a lot of emails and phone\
  \ calls.\n\nSo I was mad, I need my diploma to go to college and my parents were\
  \ screwing me over. I called my dad saying that he needs to pay this school dues\
  \ thing so I could get my diploma, and he was MAD. Saying that the school had no\
  \ right to deny me a diploma, he'd be coming in first thing next morning with me\
  \ to have a talk.\n\nI really wanted to resolve this so that night I went to my\
  \ bank and withdrew $480 and put it in my purse just in case.\n\nThe next morning,\
  \ my dad came in and demanded to see my teacher and principal before class starts.\
  \ He was getting mad saying that All the education should be covered by taxes, (bullshit,\
  \ he votes for less and less education budget every year) they can't do that, he'll\
  \ sue. (Bullshit, he doesn't have the time off work or the money to take shit to\
  \ court) \n\nMy teacher was like \"The dues are for her sports and events and trips,\
  \ not education\" and he was not listening. That bothered me, she's one of my favorite\
  \ teachers and he had no right to be disrespecting her. So I took out my money and\
  \ started counting it. Counting out $480 in twenties so I'd make sure I had the\
  \ amount right. Everyone noticed, and my dad was like \"what are you doing\" and\
  \ I didn't say anything, just gave the money to my teacher and said \"here you go,\
  \ it's all covered\" \n\nMy dad started losing it at me asking where the money was\
  \ from, and I was like \"chill it's not yours\" and he was mad at me for having\
  \ done that and undermined him as a father, and bla bla bla. \n\nAt the end of the\
  \ day, my teacher went to talk to me again and said she couldn't take the money,\
  \ to keep it for college, the school was waiving my dues. I was really shocked and\
  \ kept asking if she was sure, and she said yes, I was really thankful, like I was\
  \ crying.\n\nI went home and my dad who didn't know I had the money was furious\
  \ at me, calling me dramatic and reckless and also interrogating me about where\
  \ I got all that money.\n\nI said I didn't want to talk about it any more, enough\
  \ had been said about all it.\n\nAITA for going behind my dad's back like that?"
