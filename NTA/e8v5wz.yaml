selftext: "Short backstory... one of my wife\u2019s good friends is recently divorced\
  \ and talks non stop about how great it is, and constantly runs down her ex. She\
  \ exaggerates all his flaws to make him seem way worse than is true. My wife says\
  \ this is a topic every time they\u2019re together, not all the conversation but\
  \ enough to notice. \n\nMy issue... I pick up my wife\u2019s phone and see the last\
  \ text sent to her from said friend. It reads \u201Cwhen you going to file on ThunderGunLove\
  \ so we can both be single and really party\u201D. I asked how often she talks like\
  \ this and was told she says things like this often. \n\nI understand it\u2019s\
  \ most likely a joke and she is being funny, but I don\u2019t know where the joke\
  \ ends and the seriousness begins. She often tries to get my wife to complain about\
  \ me or our marriage, and that\u2019s just straight up not cool. \n\nWe have a very\
  \ solid marriage and I am not afraid of her deciding to divorce me, and she says\
  \ her friends \u201Cventing\u201D has zero affect on her. The issue is I think talk\
  \ like this is toxic and will eventually take a toll, and can\u2019t lead to anything\
  \ positive. She says she has asked to to take it easy on trying to get her to bad\
  \ mouth me or our marriage, but admits it\u2019s done little good. \n\nSo I asked\
  \ her to separate herself from this friend. AITA?"

  is recently divorced and seems to encourage it in others.
