selftext: "Recently married 28f & 33m. My husband is a good guy but He frequently\
  \ messes up the littlest tasks in everyday life. For instance, I cannot count how\
  \ many times I have eaten full meals with my hands because he can't be bothered\
  \ to ask for to go utensils, condiments, napkins or drinks. I try not to get mad\
  \ because I realize he is trying to be sweet, but its annoying. \n\nIt's doubly\
  \ annoying because when I plan stuff for him I make sure everything is accounted\
  \ for so he can enjoy his day. For contrast, when we went to see Bruno Mars in Vegas\
  \ he didn't even bother to look up where the concert was. He  got an Uber to the\
  \ wrong freaking venue and we missed the first 30 minutes of the show because we\
  \ had to walk to the correct venue. Ugh. \n\nThe recent issue: \n\nMy absolute favorite\
  \ movie in life is Moulin Rouge. They recently turned it into a Broadway show and\
  \ I have been excited to see it for at least the past six months.  We finally saved\
  \ up some money to do a NY weekend trip so he could eat at this famous restaurant\
  \ and I could see the Broadway show.  He booked everything two months ago. \n\n\
  Saturday comes around. We eat then head to the theater. I took pictures in front\
  \ of the marquee. I. Was. Pumped. \n\nWe finally get to the doors and I ask him\
  \ where the tickets are. He couldn't remember if he bought them under my email or\
  \ his so we're both searching through our emails and credit card statements for\
  \ any sign of the ticket confirmation. The show starts. Thirty or so minutes go\
  \ by with us frantically searching for the tickets.  Eventually he started crying\
  \ and I just knew. He never bought the tickets. Somehow he searched for the ticket\
  \ prices, we discussed where we wanted to sit, we picked out our Broadway outfits\
  \ and everything, but he never finalized the order for tickets. I fully believe\
  \ it was an honest and incredibly dumb mistake. The show was sold out so we had\
  \ to leave.  I ugly sobbed and snotted all over myself for the entire 30 min Uber\
  \ to the hotel. We flew back to Dallas without seeing the show. \n\nHe's apologized\
  \ multiple times but I really don't care. I haven't talked to him since Saturday.\
  \ He thinks I'm dragging this out and overreacting. On one hand I feel like the\
  \ asshole for continuing to be this upset but on the other hand I feel like this\
  \ is a valid reason to be pissed. I know this is first world problems, but I'm extremely\
  \ disappointed. This was my Christmas present. I told everyone I was seeing the\
  \ show then had to explain 20+ times that we actually didn't get to see it. It's\
  \ embarrassing and sad.  I'll get over it eventually but right now I'm just not\
  \ ready to stop being upset. Does that make me the asshole?\n\nEdit: thanks for\
  \ all of the replies! We are reading them together over dinner. We acknowledge that\
  \ we are both assholes in some way. My husband is going to get screened for Adhd\
  \ or ADD soon. \n\nOh and we have actual tickets to see Moulin Rouge in January.\
  \  I've confirmed the purchase."
