selftext: 'Every year at the office we pick out a day to decorate the Christmas tree.
  To my knowledge, there has been and upspoken tradition for my Jewish coworker to
  be the one that puts the star on the Xmas tree, She says this is because she is
  the only Jewish person at the office(this a few years ago, but we have plenty of
  Jewish people).


  This year we get an email about when the tree decoration will happen by my Jewish
  coworker. She explains how there will be drinks and snacks, ect. then ends the emails
  with this: *"PS - The tradition still stands that only first born purebred Jewish
  females in the office may put the star on the top of the tree."*


  I instantly find this pretty offensive that she is using the word purebred when
  it comes to religion and using that as an excuse to be the one to places the star
  on the tree each year. I followed by messaging her about how uncomfortable her email
  is, she responded by saying that no one else found it offensive and it was mainly
  a joke to another coworker who happened to be half-Jewish. (this made me even more
  uncomfortable.) She also ends up using her grandparents being in the holocaust as
  an excuse for this, it starts getting too awkward at this point and I ended the
  conversation with "it just made me uncomfortable but I guess it''s just me."


  What do you guys think about this whole situation, should I let it go or report
  it to our HR? (our HR is an online service, btw)


  **UPDATE:** I decided to wait until today''s tree party and see if any other comments
  get made. I also spoke to the other girl (she hasn''t been in the office since today)
  She read the email and said that it was super inappropriate and felt like she was
  being called Mudblood like in harry potter. She''s offended by the whole thing and
  might confront her about it.'
title: AITA for telling my Jewish coworker it's uncool to refer to people's ethnicity/race
  as "purebred"?
