selftext: "My husband beat me home today, and called me while I was still at work\
  \ to tell me he had hurt himself\u2014 he stepped on something barefoot and got\
  \ a splinter lodged in his heel. He\u2019s not very bendy, so he said he couldn\u2019\
  t reach it himself, and asked if I could help him remove it when I got home.\n\n\
  Of course, I told him, but I\u2019d be a while because I was still at work, still\
  \ needed to run some errands, get groceries, Etc. I figured it it being just a splinter,\
  \ I didn\u2019t need to drop everything and rush home.\n\nCue a couple hours later,\
  \ I walk into our condo, say hi, but he barely answers because he\u2019s busy on\
  \ the phone with his friend. My cat had managed to escape into the hallway when\
  \ I got home, so I put down the groceries and went off to catch my cat. Down the\
  \ hall, I could hear my husband screaaaaaming for me at the top of his lungs, even\
  \ with our door closed. I grabbed my cat, got back go our unit, and asked him wtf\
  \ is up with his shouting.\n\nSo he starts shouting that he\u2019s in pain, has\
  \ been waiting for me for hours, and was mad I had let the cat out to begin with.\
  \ So I tell him to calm down, let me go wash my hands and grab the tweezers, and\
  \ told him to put his foot up. I return with the supplies and he\u2019s still fuming\
  \ about how late I am, how he\u2019s been in pain, and should\u2019ve just gone\
  \ to the hospital instead of waiting for me, blah blah blah.\n\nSo I gave him the\
  \ raised eyebrow, gave him a half-laughing \u201Care you serious\u201D,  and said\
  \ he was acting like a big baby. So, still fuming, he said \u201CFine! Forget it.\
  \ I\u2019d rather go to the ER than let YOU help me with this for mocking me and\
  \ calling me a baby\u201D So he got his keys and went off to the ER. For his foot\
  \ splinter.   \nTyping this out makes it all sound so ridiculous. But I feel like\
  \ I\u2019m always in the wrong... so, WITA?"
