selftext: "basically my 14 year old daughter has been going through a phase where\
  \ she believes that she should stay up late, she has been trying to push her bed\
  \ time to 10 (its 8.30/9.00) \n\ni have split custody with her mum (my ex) and get\
  \ her every other week, I tried to confiscate her phone at bed time but she still\
  \ tried to stay up past her bed time. \nshe would hide electronics and then bring\
  \ them out when I would leave the room. \n\nso during my week with her (last week)\
  \ I decided to let her stay up as late as she wanted, she finally went to sleep\
  \ at 1 o'clock \n\nI then woke her up at 7 for school and forced her to go, she\
  \ was incredibly tired and told me that I was mean for making her go to school.\
  \ \n\nmy ex was also incredibly mad at me and thinks I took it to far, even though\
  \ my ex wasn't doing anything and just letting her go to bed at 11."
