selftext: "I was married to my ex wife for seven years, during which we've had two\
  \ children, a girl and a boy. The girl is special needs and requires additional\
  \ sessions with medical doctors for communication skills an social conduct.\n\n\
  I divorced her five years ago in less than amicable terms, following which she decided\
  \ to take our children and move to another country without my consent. Despite this,\
  \ and the fact that she never requested child or spousal support in court, I've\
  \ been sending them money on a monthly basis so as to ensure that my kids will have\
  \ all the necessities in their new home. Furthermore I've made an effort to visit\
  \ them on a yearly basis, even though they're thousands of kilometers away from\
  \ my place of residence.\n\nI've stopped making the monthly payments on two occasions:\n\
  \nThe first time my ex requested an additional payment of 500 Euros supposedly in\
  \ order to purchase clothes for my kids, and I found out that she used all the money\
  \ to buy herself a plane ticket back to her natal country for vacationing, following\
  \ which I made it clear to her that if she's going to misuse the money I send her\
  \ for the children I am under no obligation to continue this practice in good faith.\
  \ After I received assurances that no further misuse of the provided funds would\
  \ take place, I resumed the monthly payments.\n\nThe second time my ex requested\
  \ a significant sum for school fees for the two children, and due to the fact that\
  \ I had paid a significantly smaller sum on the previous year, and that I had not\
  \ received a copy of the relevant invoice which I had requested (both for tax purposes\
  \ and to verify I was not being lied to), I requested from the ex to provide me\
  \ with the school's liaison so as to settle the payment directly with them. She\
  \ got immediately abusive and defensive, acting offended that I don't trust her\
  \ (major red flag for me) and that she supposedly gets a different rate with the\
  \ school than I would due to her being unemployed. After another string of abuse\
  \ from her end, as well as her stating that she doesn;t need me because she's found\
  \ another man to take care of her and the kids, I told her clearly that due to her\
  \ refusal to provide evidence that she's using the money I send her on my children,\
  \ as well as due to her continuous abuse towards me, I will no longer be making\
  \ any payments to her.\n\nI has now been a year since I've last send her any money,\
  \ with no communication from her end. I've send her a message on WhatsApp requesting\
  \ she verify her present address in order for me to send the kids Christmas gifts\
  \ but have received no reply.\n\nAITA for no longer sending money for my kids to\
  \ my ex?\n\nEDIT: Thank you for all your responses so far, just wanted to reply\
  \ to some frequent questions:\n\n1. Why didn't you take your ex to court on kidnapping\
  \ charges?\n\nA: Because I don't want to traumatize my kids by having police officers\
  \ drag their mom away in handcuffs and them being taken into CPS, even for a short\
  \ while. Despite all her actions, I still believe we can settle this in a civilized\
  \ manner without getting the authorities involved.\n\n2) Why did you allow them\
  \ to leave the country in the first place?\n\nA: I didn't know they were going to\
  \ leave. I left the ex and the kids in my own apartment and moved out, I visited\
  \ weekly to bring groceries and take the kids out to the park as the ex was pretending\
  \ to be ill from my leaving her. She did ask me for plane ticket fare but I refused,\
  \ apparently she sourced the money from elsewhere or she had saved up her own. The\
  \ border agents should have stopped her but did not, don't know why or how she made\
  \ it through but she is a citizen.\n\n3) Why don't you ask for full custody of the\
  \ kids?\n\nA: I could do that, but it would not be enforced unless the ex came back\
  \ to my country with the kids, which I've been led to understand will never happen.\
  \ The decision for the custody cannot be enforced by foreign states, the mom and\
  \ the kids must reside within the country's borders.\n\nEDIT2: Because apparently\
  \ it's important, according to my lawyer the amount I was willingly sending monthly\
  \ was significantly greater than the MAXIMUM child support that would be ruled for\
  \ my income - roughly 50% more, in fact. This may also explain why the ex refused\
  \ to go to court for child support.\n\nUPDATE: Once again, thanks to everyone that\
  \ offered constructive comments and criticism. I have decided to try to get in touch\
  \ with the ex and start providing some financial support once again, not having\
  \ any restriction on how she uses the money but requiring nonetheless that I have\
  \ weekly contact with the kids over WhatsApp. As someone correctly commented, if\
  \ the ex doesn't want to behave as an adult, I have to be a big enough adult for\
  \ both of us and ensure that the children are not affected from their parents' falling\
  \ out. I guess my bitterness on being taken for a fool by the ex didn't let me see\
  \ the whole picture and realize the wider consequences of my actions. \n\nSo far,\
  \ I haven't been able to reach the ex - either she changed her number or just reads\
  \ my messages without responding - but I'll keep trying."
