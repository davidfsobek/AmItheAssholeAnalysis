selftext: 'About a month before my niece''s 4th birthday I text my sister about a
  potential gift for her. My sister enthusiastically agrees that it would be a good
  gift. I buy it. About a week later, on Thanksgiving, I inquire about when the birthday
  party is taking place and my sister does not have concrete details but will inform
  me when things are more figured out. Fast forward about a week and I see photos
  from the party on facebook.


  Not trying to sound overly virtuous but I always try to be as clear and direct as
  possible with these kinds of things; I also avoid insults and do my best to not
  sound passive aggressive. So I text my sister later that day that I am disappointed
  that she didn''t let me know about the party especially after talking about it twice.
  She proceeds to send me a wall of text about how the mix of her work schedule, family
  drama, and the fact that she lives an hour away meant that she relied on the rest
  of my family to inform me of all the details. The catch is, she never asked them
  to; so they didn''t. I reply by pointing that fact out. She then in about 12 sentences
  says that she has too much going on in her life to be "catching shit" for this and
  doesn''t need me "coming at me and adding drama to my life." I simply state that
  none of that is a good enough reason for simply not sending a text. This dispute
  "ended" when a block became warranted because my texts were easily outnumbered 5
  to 1 and she just wouldn''t stop. I didn''t even receive an apology until about
  9 texts in and it was an "I''m sorry you feel that way." And fun fact, with the
  exception of the fight this same thing happened last year as well.


  I would just save the gift for Christmas, but because my niece''s birthday is so
  close to Christmas, I bought gifts for both occasions at the same time. I can''t
  just double up on her Christmas gift because she would be getting twice as much
  as my other nieces and I don''t think that''s fair. And since I received nothing
  but indignation from my sister, I don''t feel obligated to make the hour trip make
  sure my niece receives her gift. So I figure I should just take it back to the store.
  That $30 will actually go a long way for easing the financial burden of the holidays
  for me.


  Am I the asshole for wanting to return the gift?

  \*\*Update\*\* So it''s been couple of days and as of this update I have read every
  single comment under the post. Thank you all for your input it helped me greatly;
  I returned the gift. To everyone who said I''m the AH, I agreed with the most common
  sentiment. It sucks that I changed my actions towards my niece based of the actions
  of her mother. It''s definitely not fair to my niece, and I don''t feel good about
  doing it but here''s my reasoning for why I did:


  My niece is 4 years old. A child. My relationship with her is entirely dependent
  on my sister. If I want to just go see her, or if my niece ever says "I want to
  see uncle Terrysnerdstuff," it won''t mean anything without my sister''s say so.
  Between my sister and her ex (my niece''s father who I have only met two times total),
  my chances to have any kind of relationship with my niece in spite of her parents
  are zero. If my sister denies me the opportunity to actually be an uncle, there''s
  nothing I can do. And I''m certainly not going to waste money for it because at
  this point gift giving can''t be an expression of my relationship to my niece, it''s
  an obligation. Since that is the case; no invite, no gift. I don''t offer that kind
  of courtesy to other other people''s kids so why should I do the same for my sister
  and her kid if she''s keen on staying at arms'' length?


  Also, to everyone saying an hour drive isn''t that much. You''re right, it''s not.
  But if what''s waiting for me upon arrival is a complete chore then the distance
  becomes much more excruciating.


  And lastly, there were few commentators who tried to shame because $30 is a substantial
  amount of money to me. Kindly shut it, you''re neither helpful nor kind.'
