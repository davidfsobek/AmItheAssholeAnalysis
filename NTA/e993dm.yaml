selftext: "My roommate recently got a google home and set it up in the living room.\
  \ I immediately asked her to put it in her room because I feel uncomfortable with\
  \ listening devices in a collaborative space. She says she needs it to work from\
  \ home (we\u2019ve been living together for 3+ months and she didn\u2019t have one\
  \ until now though). She thinks I\u2019m being irrational because it\u2019s the\
  \ \u201Csame technology in your phone\u201D. I work in Cybersecurity and know my\
  \ literature in which companies have the most data breaches and stuff. Ultimately\
  \ it comes down to the fact that I am uncomfortable with the technology in a shared\
  \ space and she is not respecting that. I pointed this out to her and she didn\u2019\
  t deny it and just keep rattling on about how I\u2019m being irrational and I shouldn\u2019\
  t touch her stuff (i.e. her google home). I\u2019ve suggested coming to a compromise\
  \ but she won\u2019t budge on putting it in her room. I even suggested we leave\
  \ it unplugged unless she is explicitly using it, which she also won\u2019t do because\
  \ I \u201Cdon\u2019t spend as much time in the living room so it affects me less.\u201D\
  \ Am I the asshole?"
