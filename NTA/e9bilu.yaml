selftext: 'I (46M) live with my wife and my 17 year old son. My wife has been on a
  different continent for about a month taking care of her dying mother, so it has
  just been me and my son for that time.


  My son and I have a very close relationship where he tells me almost everything
  going on in his life. On Saturday, he told me that he was going to his first ever
  high school party this upcoming weekend. He was a bit nervous since he had never
  really drank before, but he knew that he was going to on that occasion. I''m not
  sure if this is relevant, but this is in Canada where the drinking age is 19 (in
  my province), and teenage drinking is very common.


  I asked my son if he wanted to have a few beers with me while we watched a sports
  game that night, as a "test run" of sorts. My logic was that if he goes into the
  party with zero awareness of his tolerance then it could end badly, and it would
  be best for him to find out his limit in the safety of his home with me.


  We had some beers over a few hours in the night, and I cut him off at 6 (he has
  had beer in the past, but never more than one at a time). He was pretty drunk but
  he was okay, and slept it off. We talked about it the next day, and we agreed that
  six was a bit much for him, and now he knows to have fewer than that at the party.


  I was actually pretty content with this whole situation, since he had his "first
  experience" drinking in a safe environment, and I feel much more comfortable with
  him going to a party now. However, in an effort to be transparent I told my wife
  about it the other day over the phone, and she was livid. She thinks it was reckless
  and irresponsible.


  AITA?


  INFO: I understandably am getting flack for not telling my wife beforehand, but
  I figured she had enough going on and I didn''t need to bother her with something
  that seemed pretty trivial at the time


  EDIT: Thanks for all the comments, I am reading every single one! I appreciate the
  different perspectives'
