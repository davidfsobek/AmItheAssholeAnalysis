selftext: "Throw away because of personal details. \n\nMy daughters birthday was on\
  \ December first, she turned 17. I got her something that I didn\u2019t get until\
  \ my mid 20s, a car. \n\nI had my daughter very young (when I was her age) and want\
  \ her to have all of the opportunity that I didn\u2019t. She got her first part\
  \ time job, and I wanted her to be able to travel without worrying about the bus\
  \ or depending on people. I saved for nearly a year to get her a car, a 2008 Nissan\
  \ Altima. I\u2019m obviously not wealthy, this car is better than *my* car. It\u2019\
  s newer, safer and rides much better. \n\nWhen I gave her the car she turned her\
  \ nose up at it. She complained, and nearly cried. She pointed out small dings and\
  \ scratches, she said the color is ugly, and that she would be embarrassed to drive\
  \ it. Besides being angry about this, my feelings are hurt. I put a lot of love\
  \ into this car. \n\nMy daughters mother is now married, and they take in foster\
  \ children. Their current foster is a year older than my daughter, she has been\
  \ living with them for around two years. My ex and her husband are actually going\
  \ through the process of adopting her. This girl has had it rough, but she\u2019\
  s very kind and hard working. She is doing dual enrollment at the local community\
  \ college. She takes the bus about an hour each way. \n\nI was hoping that my daughter\
  \ would be able to help give her rides so that the car would benefit both of them.\
  \ I had the idea to just give the car to the foster daughter. WIBTA for this? \n\
  \nMy girlfriend says that it would be an asshole move because my daughter would\
  \ come to her senses and eventually want the car. With how she turned her nose up\
  \ at it, I would feel better giving it to someone that I know would appreciate it\
  \ and teach my daughter a lesson in the process.\n\nUPDATE:\nAll of the adults involved\
  \ will be hammering out the situation this weekend, and many people have asked for\
  \ an update so I will let you all know what happens. As it stands though, my daughter\
  \ will not be getting a car."
