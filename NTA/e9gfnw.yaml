selftext: "Our daughter who was seven years old died on November 28 as a result of\
  \ her cancer (leukemia).\n\nI would allow my two other kids (11 and 15) to stay\
  \ with her overnight at the hospital if my wife or I were there. \n\nOn November\
  \ 28 our daughter took her last breath. She had suffered a bleed in her brain and\
  \ the doctors said that there was nothing they could (except cause her significant\
  \ pain if they attempted surgery). So instead, we let our kids stay with her while\
  \ she took her last breaths. \n\nRecently my extended family found out and said\
  \ I was in the wrong. My sister (a LMSW) told me I could've traumautized our children\
  \ and have life-lasting impacts on them as a result of them watching her passaway.\
  \ \n\nI need other peoples thoughts on this as it was an extremely difficult choice\
  \ to make but one I thought was appropriate."
