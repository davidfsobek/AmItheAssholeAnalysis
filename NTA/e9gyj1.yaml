selftext: "I had a crappy employee who really drug everyone down and committed many\
  \ somewhat minor, but nonetheless fireable, offenses over the past 3-4 months. \
  \ Being that she has just purchased a house, has a baby on the way, and it\u2019\
  s so close to Christmas, I was going to wait until her quarterly review in January\
  \ to discuss the issues further and possibly terminate at that point.  She came\
  \ in today to tender her resignation to take a different job (with only 2 day\u2019\
  s notice, by the way).  I accepted the resignation and told her I\u2019d prepare\
  \ her final check before lunch and she could then go, and use the rest of the week\
  \ to prepare for her new job.  After about an hour she comes back to my office to\
  \ let me know she doesn\u2019t actually have the new job after all and rescinds\
  \ her resignation.  I told her that due to her show of non-commitment to the company,\
  \ I found it best for her to leave right away.  She literally snatched the check\
  \ and left the building while swearing and insulting everyone on her way out.  AITA\
  \ for not allowing her to rescind?"
