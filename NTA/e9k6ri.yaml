selftext: "I got married in September. I booked our photographer over a year in advance.\
  \ He has great reviews and I really like his work. We knew that his assistant would\
  \ be the one shooting our actual wedding, and we were fine with that. We had a really\
  \ jovial, friendly rapport built up during the engagement photos, it was all great.\
  \ The wedding day came, his assistant was a doll and we loved him. I paid the full\
  \ price for everything, and right on time. At no time were we difficult clients,\
  \ but totally the opposite. \n\nOur contract states that after the wedding, we can\
  \ expect to see rough edits, ask for some changes, and then get the full gallery\
  \ back. It states not to expect anything in less than 30 days, but it could take\
  \ as long as 90 days. Verbally, he told me that turnaround was typically 8 weeks.\
  \ \n\n8 weeks after the wedding, I hadn't heard anything at all (no sneak peek,\
  \ no rough edits, had not seen a single pic), so I sent a text asking how things\
  \ were going. He referenced the 90 days, and said he was running on time. I was\
  \ disappointed, but the contract does say 90 days on the outside, so I let it go.\
  \ \n\nOn day 85 I sent another text, checking in. He replied to say that his mom\
  \ had passed two days before, and he'd be taking the rest of the month off, and\
  \ would resume working after the first of the year. \n\nI replied with support,\
  \ but also indicated that I was concerned that we weren't going to abide by the\
  \ contract, and that I'd expected to have the photos before the holidays so I could\
  \ gift albums to my parents and new in-laws. He replied with \"There is an act of\
  \ God clause.\" The contract does mention acts of God, but specifically with regards\
  \ to if there is an emergency and the photographer can't make it to your wedding.\
  \ It details how he'd attempt to find a replacement photog, etc. I reaffirmed my\
  \ sympathy for his situation, but restated my concern at the fact that we've seen\
  \ nothing yet, and we are worried. He replied with just, \"wow.\" \n\nI understand\
  \ that against the loss of a parent my desire for photographs seems trivial, but\
  \ it's been three months. I paid a lot of money for the pictures, and I really want\
  \ them back. It is so delicate, and I honestly feel bad for him, and really empathize\
  \ with his loss... but I do feel entitled to what I paid for and contractually agreed\
  \ to. To be informed 5 days before the deadline and only because *I* reached out,\
  \ doesn't sit well with me. It seems unprofessional, and at the very least, like\
  \ he should have offered a partial refund for not making the deadline. I would have\
  \ refused that offer if he'd extended it, but would have appreciated the gesture\
  \ of good faith. Mostly, I just want the pictures. I want to know for sure something\
  \ didn't happen to them, and the record of our beautiful day isn't lost. \n\nSo.\
  \ It's now day 93. No pics. AITA for mentioning the contract and still wanting my\
  \ pictures despite his mom passing?"
