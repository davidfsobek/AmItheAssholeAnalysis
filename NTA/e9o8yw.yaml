selftext: "I'm a grown ass man, I'm 32, my family is huge and unbelievably annoying.\
  \ I'm gay and that is the Voldemort of our family. Everyone knows about it, and\
  \ most are afraid to acknowledge it. For that reason, everyone is fucking weird\
  \ around me, they never know what to talk to me about, they're afraid of asking\
  \ me anything so they don't really know much about me or my life, and they usually\
  \ end up talking about the weather, themselves, or my seven million nieces and nephews.\n\
  \nYears ago I started dealing with the problem by coming to such gatherings as rarely\
  \ as possible, and when I have to be there, I just get drunk. Not the lying-under-the-table-puking-in-Nana's-shoes\
  \ plastered, but finding-everything-amusing drunk. I'm not normally a drinker, so\
  \ it doesn't take me much to get to that stage.\n\nHowever, recently, my brother\
  \ made the observation that I drink every time he sees me. He sounded almost worried\
  \ and asked if I drink every day, and I said no, not at all. Then he started laughing\
  \ and said: what, you only drink when you see us? Huehuehue you couldn't handle\
  \ being around us sober, huh? Huehue! \n\nAnd I just sort of smiled, and took a\
  \ sip of my mulled wine and didn't respond.\n\n20 minutes later, my mom comes up\
  \ to me and says my brother's wife told her I only get drunk when I'm around them\
  \ because I can't stand any of them. I ask her how my sister in law knows that,\
  \ because I never said it. She goes away and comes back with my SIL who admits I\
  \ never said it, but I never denied it either. They put me on the spot so I said\
  \ it's not as bad as that, I just find it easier to socialize with so many people\
  \ if I have 2-3 drinks.\n\nMy mom and SIL were like nooope, you hate us, admit you\
  \ hate us, well fine, if you hate us, fine, don't come see us anymore, who cares,\
  \ we don't care, you don't care, nobody cares and so on and so forth. It was just\
  \ a vomit of passive aggression that I wasn't able to get a word in, so finally,\
  \ when they asked me to leave, I did.\n\nThe only person who's contacted me since\
  \ then is my brother, who laughed when he spoke to me on the phone and said \"they\
  \ didn't mean it\" but admitted that he felt it was assholish of me to get drunk\
  \ at every gathering. Honestly, the other option for me is to not go at all. I'm\
  \ going because they like seeing me and being with me (despite not liking most things\
  \ ABOUT me), so I feel like getting a little drunk is the less assholish route than\
  \ not going at all.\n\n**Edit: yall... I just logged in after a few hours of being\
  \ away... to 500 comments. Sorry if I'm unable to respond to too many.**\n\nEdit\
  \ 2: Just to make it clear to the people who are under the impression my family\
  \ isn't homophobic - just because I didn't list the shit they did to me or try to\
  \ do to me, doesn't mean they aren't homophobic.\n\nMy parents have invited strangers\
  \ to our house to talk to me when I was 17, to tell me I will never find happiness,\
  \ truth or love as long as I am an immoral person, they outed me to the whole fucking\
  \ town when they talked to the priest and he made me the topic of one of his Sunday\
  \ services, which in turn resulted in every kid I went to school with to know I'm\
  \ gay, bully me, beat the shit out of me.\n\nThey tried stopping me from going to\
  \ university for fear it would exacerbate my gay feelings, they called me disgusting,\
  \ an animal, an embarrassment, \"not my son\", my father demolished my room when\
  \ I left for university and told me I wasn't welcome there anymore, I didn't speak\
  \ to any of them for two years as a result of that and so on and so forth. Getting\
  \ to where I am with my family now took a lot of hard hard work and \"getting over\
  \ it\" and it's exhausting keeping it up, avoiding most topics about my life, not\
  \ being able to be my authentic self."
title: AITA for drinking alcohol at every family gathering and cryptically smiling
  when somebody suggested I do it because I can't handle hanging out with them?
