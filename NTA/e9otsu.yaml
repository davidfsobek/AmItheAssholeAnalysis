selftext: "\nYesterday I got home from work and the apartment was empty. I share it\
  \ with a guy and a girl I knew from college. I'm a girl btw.\n\nI went to my room\
  \ and put on my Bluetooth noise cancelling headphones and called my friend. She\
  \ lives a couple states away now, and we have a long call every few weeks to catch\
  \ up. I usually call her right after work; my roommates tend to work later so I'm\
  \ used to having privacy for the call.\n\nWe talked about work, our sports, her\
  \ new apartment, all sorts of stuff. Then we started talking about my living situation.\n\
  \nI said \"Oh I'm so frustrated with my roommate John. He has a new girl over every\
  \ few days and he doesn't even take them to his bedroom, he'll hang out in the living\
  \ room and watch Netflix and I'll just walk in on him feeling them up... Plus I\
  \ swear they're stealing my shampoo and conditioner... Like have they never learned\
  \ to pack a hoe-bag with their own toiletries? And I can't even fucking tell them\
  \ to pack their own shower stuff because IT'S NEVER THE SAME GIRL TWICE! WHAT DO\
  \ I EVEN DO? MAKE A GODDAMN SIGN? DEAR ALL OF JOHN'S ONE NIGHT STANDS...?\n\nMy\
  \ friend was laughing hard, plus I was wearing my noise cancelling headphones so\
  \ I didn't hear a thing but our conversation. I was raising my voice near the end,\
  \ for comedic effect, not because I was really that mad. \n\nA couple minutes later,\
  \ we were talking about something else and I heard pounding on my bedroom door.\
  \ I told her to wait a minute and went to the door.\n\nJohn was there and he was\
  \ mad; he'd come home with a date and they were sitting down to watch something\
  \ when she heard my whole tirade and he was sure I'd known he had a girl over and\
  \ did it on purpose.\n\nI said I wasn't doing that, I thought I was alone and I\
  \ was just venting and making my friend laugh. But he didn't believe me, he snapped\
  \ at me for being petty, being a cockblock, etc. \n\nHe also said it sounded \"\
  psycho\" to make a bathroom sign and I was like \"chill that was obviously a joke\"\
  \n\nI told him to walk it off, my friend was still on the line and I wanted to talk\
  \ to her.\n\nHe's still pissed off a day later\n\nAITA?\n\n----\n\nEdit - to everyone\
  \ saying I should address it with him, I've tried a bunch.\n\nI've told him I'd\
  \ prefer if he took them straight to his room instead of making out and feeling\
  \ up on the sofa because that's not something I wanna see. And he shot that idea\
  \ down saying he can't just take a girl home and take her straight to his bed, girls\
  \ don't like it without foreplay. So I was like \"how about you do that foreplay\
  \ in your car or at a pub or something\" and he said no to that too.\n\nI've also\
  \ asked him to tell them to stop using my shampoo and he's like \"ok sure\" but\
  \ then, somehow, my bottles still empty even when I'm on vacation, or even when\
  \ I haven't washed my hair at my own place for weeks (I often shower at the gym\
  \ and then don't shower at home that night)\n\nSo he's well aware of all this already..\n\
  \nAlso I definitely didn't mean to have him overhear, this was at 5:30 and he doesn't\
  \ get off work till 6, then has a 45 minute commute. I had no idea he'd taken off\
  \ work, I was purposely calling my friend at a time i expected to have the place\
  \ to myself so I'd have privacy"

  every few days? One of the girls overheard.
