selftext: 'My DH thinks I''m being a "justified asshole" here, but I don''t think
  I''m being an asshole at all, given the circumstances. So, I''m here for you to
  judge me.


  My stepson asked me to make cookies for a bake sale a club of his is having next
  week, and I''ve refused. I did this exact same thing two weeks ago, and after he
  got back to his mom''s house, his little sister ate all of the cookies. This is
  becoming a pattern. Whenever I send him home with baked goods that I''ve made for
  him specifically (or in this instance, for his club) one of his younger sisters
  or his mom and her boyfriend eat everything. If he doesn''t grab one before he leaves
  our house, he''s out of luck. I''m just at my wits end, and I''m done with this.


  I told my stepson that I''m not going to be making these cookies, and I told him
  straight up - we''ve been here before, and I''m not baking for his sisters or his
  mom and her boyfriend. I bake for him. If he wants to share some of it with his
  siblings or mom, go ahead. I just don''t want him to be left with nothing because
  people went straight for the baked goods as soon as he got through the door. He''s
  told them before not to do this, and they refuse to listen. So, now I''m being the
  bad guy because I''m saying no. After he asked me, I told him that unless we''re
  taking things directly to the bake sale, then I''m not baking. I''m also not giving
  him baked goods to take to his mom''s anymore. We''ll keep things that I make for
  him at our house, where he actually gets a chance to eat them.


  I don''t think I''m an asshole here, especially because he gets really upset whenever
  this happens. People even go into his bedroom (while he''s in the bathroom or something)
  if they know he has snacks in there, just so they can eat them. This just happened
  with a chocolate advent calendar his mom got him, and it happens every damn time
  I send him home with baked goods. He gets upset, and then I get upset because I
  wasn''t baking to make him upset about not getting any cookies himself.


  So, AITA? DH thinks I''m punishing my stepson by not baking stuff for him to take
  home anymore, while I don''t think that at all.'
