selftext: This is her first pregnancy and she's about 6 months along. She's recently
  started complaining that people are pulling away from her. The last time we hung
  out she confronted me about my own pulling away saying I wasn't being a good friend.
  Admittedly I *have* been pulling away but not because she's pregnant it's because
  it has become unbearable for me to watch her harm her unborn child everyday. She's
  a half pack a day smoker and an everyday pot/dab smoker. Pregnancy DID NOT slow
  her down one bit. I can't  hangout with her cause the first thing she wants to do
  is smoke a joint or do a dab and we'll be smoking the whole time we hangout. I feel
  guilty because I feel like I'm contributing to her harming her baby. I tried switching
  our hangouts to activities that we could do outside of the house so there was less
  of an opportunity to smoke but she'll just want to smoke a joint before she leaves
  or she'll pop out to her car to smoke while we're out. So when she confronted me
  I was honest and told her I loved her but didn't condone her behavior. She was furious
  saying I had no right to judge her as this is not my baby and I have never been
  pregnant so I don't understand the kind of stress she is under and smoking helps
  that stress. Should I have just kept my mouth shut?
