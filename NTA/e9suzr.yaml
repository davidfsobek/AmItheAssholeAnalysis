selftext: "Backstory: So I'm black, and I have really thick 4c hair that's just too\
  \ stressful for me to maintain sometimes, so I just braid my hair in cornrows and\
  \ wear wigs sometimes. It's simple, fast and convenient. Not many people can tell\
  \ it's a wig so they always ask questions about how I get my hair like that. I usually\
  \ just explain that it's not my real hair. \n\nNow to the meat of the story. Today,\
  \ I was hanging out with one of my white friends in the library (finals week), studying\
  \ together. We're making jokes on a break and just chilling. He starts to play with\
  \ my hair but he's a very touchy feely person so I don't think much of it. All of\
  \ a sudden, he pulls the hair and it falls off my head. In a room full of people.\
  \ I was in shock. For like 5 seconds I didn't move. I put the wig back on in shame\
  \ and guess what he does? Laugh. He doesn't even apologize at first he just laughs.\
  \ I packed up my stuff and left. He's been texting and calling me all afternoon\
  \ apologizing and saying that I have no reason to be this upset with him, that,\
  \ \"most girls have fake hair, no one cares\". Well I care, and I think its stupid\
  \ that the first thing he did was laugh. \n\nI'm not sure if cutting him off and\
  \ never speaking to him again is overreacting/will make me an asshole, but I am\
  \ boiling over with rage.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, if I do cut him off, this would be\
  \ the second person I'm getting rid of in 3 weeks. Seems a bit excessive and I wonder\
  \ if I'm the problem.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAITA?"
