selftext: "Basically my grandma gave out jewelry to the grandchildren about a year\
  \ ago so that she could make sure that whatever she wanted to leave for everyone\
  \ got to the right person. She gave me her favorite necklace, a Mexican fire opal\
  \ with diamonds around it attached to the chain with a black onyx on a 14 k gold\
  \ chain. The last time she appraised it (which was years ago) it was worth $1500.\
  \ \n\nWe could all tell she was most excited to give me this necklace over anything\
  \ else she gave away and her face always lights up in a way that I haven\u2019t\
  \ seen since my grandpa was alive whenever I wear it around her. I have amber colored\
  \ hair and she\u2019s always going on about how perfectly the jewel matches it.\
  \ Seeing that necklace made me happy, especially since I\u2019m now very close to\
  \ not having my grandma around any more.\n\nMy boyfriend and I have been living\
  \ with his dad to help out with the younger kids. About 3 weeks ago we went to his\
  \ grandmothers house to help out with taking her Christmas decor out of the attic.\
  \ When we got back 4 days later I went into my jewelry box to get my necklace out\
  \ and it was gone. I figured I must have taken it off and put it somewhere weird\
  \ so I didn\u2019t freak. \n\nWhen his sister (let\u2019s call her Emily) got home\
  \ from her moms house I asked her if she had seen it. She admitted to me that she\
  \ had went into my room looking for something pretty to take a selfie with and took\
  \ it. I wasn\u2019t even mad upon hearing this just relieved that someone knew where\
  \ it was but then she admits that she lost it. My boyfriend went and told his dad\
  \ while I made Emily search her room with me. While we were looking her dad comes\
  \ in, tells her not to take things that aren\u2019t hers, and then tells her to\
  \ get ready for an outing they were going on. She leaves without finding my necklace\
  \ and everyone soon forgot about it.  Her dad doesn\u2019t seem to care that his\
  \ daughter stole something very valuable to me. \n\nShe left for her moms last week\
  \ and agreed to check there in case she had brought it with her. She just got back\
  \ today and still hasn\u2019t found it and is making no effort to look. She did\
  \ say that she hid it somewhere safe because she knew it looked valuable so as much\
  \ as I\u2019ve been looking for it, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be able to find\
  \ it and if anyone can then it\u2019s her. The problem is she doesn\u2019t care\
  \ because there is no consequence to her actions. \n\nSo would I be an asshole if\
  \ I sat with her and basically chew her out for stealing something so precious to\
  \ me in an attempt to make her want to go find it? Is there a better way to go about\
  \ this? I know she\u2019s only 11 and kids are curious but there has to be some\
  \ kind of consequence for this right? \n\nTL;DR my boyfriends little sister stole\
  \ my grandmas $1500 necklace out of my room and lost it, would I be the asshole\
  \ if I went bitch mode on her to make her find it?\n\nUpdate to clear some things\
  \ up: \nI made it clear to everyone in the house how valuable the necklace is and\
  \ how much it means to me the moment I found out it was stolen. No I do not pay\
  \ rent because I was asked to uproot my entire life and move 2 states away to allow\
  \ my boyfriend to be closer to his siblings and help out with them since their dad\
  \ isn\u2019t home a lot of times. We also clean up after everyone including the\
  \ dad. We\u2019re basically live in nannies/house keepers. \n\nI did have a brief\
  \ convo with Emily today and she said that she is determined to find it. Not sure\
  \ if I believe that one though because she was playing sims during this not really\
  \ paying much attention to me. I did plan on asking her about it further but she\
  \ went back to her moms house, I didn\u2019t know she was leaving until after she\
  \ left. I text her for updates but she just keeps saying she can\u2019t find it.\
  \ \n\nI\u2019ve torn her room apart while she\u2019s been gone and looked in every\
  \ bag, pocket, drawer or anything I could think of. I did find a couple other lost\
  \ items that I wasn\u2019t very upset about because it was things like lip gloss\
  \ and hair pins but this shows me that she has been going into my room without permission\
  \ to take things for some time now. I knew she had been messing with my makeup but\
  \ didn\u2019t really care because I don\u2019t wear it often anyways and I myself\
  \ have 5 younger siblings so I\u2019m used to sharing without consenting lol. \n\
  \nYou guys are right, I need to talk to her dad about this. I had my boyfriend talk\
  \ to him already but his dad changed the topic whenever it\u2019s brought up. I\u2019\
  m pretty sure because of the divorce both mom and dad are trying to be the favorite\
  \ because neither of the kids receive much discipline unless it\u2019s from my bf\
  \ or me. \n\nI was thinking about maybe calling her school to see if maybe they\
  \ could send notes home with all the kids about it but I\u2019m unsure if that\u2019\
  s something the school would do. \n\nI do need to be careful because I am enrolled\
  \ in school over here and my boyfriend and I are working here too. We wouldn\u2019\
  t be able to move out immediately if things got nasty unless we went back to my\
  \ family a couple states away meaning I\u2019d have to drop school and both our\
  \ jobs. \n\nThanks everyone for your replies. I think I will bring up the larceny\
  \ thing along with the appraisal papers and make it clear that I don\u2019t intend\
  \ on pressing charges just that I want him to to understand the gravity of the situation.\
  \ I\u2019ll update again after I talk to him hopefully by tonight. \n\nThanks again\
  \ \u2764\uFE0F\n\nEdit 2: \nI\u2019m overwhelmed by the amount of support I\u2019\
  ve gotten from here! I truly do appreciate everyone\u2019s input and I\u2019m sorry\
  \ for not replying to all of your comments. \n\nI talked to Emily after I picked\
  \ her up from school and informed her that the necklace must be found before I leave\
  \ for Christmas next Friday because my grandma will be expecting me to wear it at\
  \ Christmas dinner and that when she asks where it is I will not hesitate to tell\
  \ the truth. Grandma may be old but she\u2019s a straight savage when it comes to\
  \ her grandkids and I know if it comes down to something drastic I can count on\
  \ her to be the one to bring it. Which is why I\u2019ve avoided telling her so far.\
  \ \U0001F605\n\nI didn\u2019t get a chance to talk to dad today and I work late\
  \ tonight so odds are he\u2019ll be asleep by the time I get home but I guess I\u2019\
  ll try again tomorrow. \n\nThanks again for all the heartfelt responses. \u2764\uFE0F"
