selftext: "I\u2019m 16F. I have a 12M brother. The creepy guy next door is a grade\
  \ above my brother at his school. Neither of us talk to him. He\u2019s a creeper.\
  \ The fence separating our house has several small holes. He uses the holes to spy\
  \ on me. I have caught him a few times spying on me in my bedroom. I have told my\
  \ parents about that and they have talked to the neighbors. The creepy guy doesn\u2019\
  t admit to spying on us and nothing ever happens. I was in the backyard with my\
  \ brother yesterday and I noticed him spying on me through one of the fence holes\
  \ again. I whispered to my brother to turn on the water supply to the hose when\
  \ I get to the mouth of the hose that is next to the fence separating us. He did\
  \ and I aimed it over the fence to where the creepy guy is supposed to be. I heard\
  \ him scream. His mom came over and knocked on our door. Our parents weren\u2019\
  t home yet. I told her that his son has been creeping on me again and since his\
  \ parents won\u2019t deal out the punishment, we will. She told us to that was super\
  \ mean of us, but said her kid won\u2019t be allowed in the backyard anymore. We\
  \ thanked her for finally putting an end to this. His mom came over later and told\
  \ our parents what happened. Our parents yelled at us for spraying water on the\
  \ creepy neighbor."
