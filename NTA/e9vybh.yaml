selftext: "I feel like I would be TA if I said something, but I'd like to make sure...\n\
  \nSo my birthday rolled around recently and I was excited to spend the night with\
  \ my gf as well as recieved gifts. I know it seems materialistic but I always look\
  \ forward to them. Anyway, after hyping up the presents a bit, I opened up the present\
  \ to find... My own sweatshirt that she had taken, as some girlfriends to.\n\n I\
  \ was really underwhelmed but thought that possibly there would be something tomorrow,\
  \ as it sounded like she was hinting at that... The next day rolls around and she\
  \ did get me a gift, but that gift ended up being a donut with a note to have a\
  \ good day.\n\nI feel like it was honestly a bit low effort and it makes me feel\
  \ a bit down... WIBTA if I shared this with her?\n\nEdit: Thank you for the advice...\
  \ I'll wait until Monday to be sure it isn't a prank, and it it isn't, I'll very\
  \ carefully tell her how I feel."
