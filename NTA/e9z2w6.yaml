selftext: "Hey all. I feel like this title sounds like \u201Cmiserable old crone bans\
  \ fun.\u201D Hell, maybe it is, I don\u2019t know. \n\nI have a really nice hill\
  \ for sledding on my property. I do live in a hilly area, but there are lots of\
  \ trees in the way of sledding on most peoples\u2019 properties. When I bought the\
  \ property originally, the guy told me that the kids liked to sled there in the\
  \ winter. I really didn\u2019t have a problem with it, I like kids. So for the past\
  \ few years, I\u2019ve been letting the neighborhood kids sled on the hill. I\u2019\
  ve even taken efforts to clear off weeds, trees, and rocks that surface there during\
  \ the rest of the year. \n\nThe last year was a little different. First of all,\
  \ I think that the \u201Csledding hill\u201D thing spread outside of the neighborhood,\
  \ so there were a lot more kids than I was used to. Second, one of the kids crashed\
  \ his sled and broke his wrist. Thankfully, I knew the kid and his Mom and she didn\u2019\
  t blame me for it, but I realized it might be more liability than I was willing\
  \ to take on. With that in mind, I posted on the town\u2019s Facebook group that\
  \ I couldn\u2019t let the kids use the hill anymore. Not much of a response. \n\n\
  The first snow, things were fine. Second snow, I noticed that there were some kids\
  \ sledding. I went and told them off, maybe not as politely as I should have. Just,\
  \ \u201Cget off, I told you guys you couldn\u2019t be here.\u201D I went to Home\
  \ Depot and bought some of that orange fencing, which I put up to try and at least\
  \ send the message that it was blocked off.\n\nSomeone posted on the Facebook group,\
  \ \u201CAnyone know why they closed down the sledding hill?\u201D Others expressed\
  \ confusion. One person said: \u201CThe \u2018owner\u2019 of the hill doesn\u2019\
  t want kids there anymore.\u201D A few angry faced reactions. I commented basically\
  \ saying what I wrote here. People responded to me saying I shouldn\u2019t really\
  \ be ruining the kids\u2019 fun, I could have all the parents agree that I\u2019\
  m not liable for injuries and sign a waiver. One woman seemed offended at the idea\
  \ that the neighborhood was \u201Clitigious.\u201D \n\nI know how some people feel\u2014\
  my property, my decision, and in some ways I feel that too. Same time, I wonder\
  \ if I should be making some sort of compromise. I\u2019m aware that the kids have\
  \ been using it for years, used it before I was even here, and I am really disappointing\
  \ them by just banning them from the hill.\n\nAITA?"
title: AITA for banning kids from sledding on the hill on my property, even though
  I allowed them to do it for years?
