selftext: "So 11 years ago on my son's 9th birthday, we got him a puppy (Toby). He\
  \ had begged and pleaded and made all kinds of promises for years, and we finally\
  \ caved in. It his birthday gift, but we made it very clear that although the puppy\
  \ was his birthday gift, the dog was our family dog, not specifically his dog. My\
  \ wife has always been of the belief that pets are family members and not possessions,\
  \ and she made sure our son knew this from the get go.\n\nAlthough my son has always\
  \ loved this dog with all his heart, after the first 5 years my son got busy with\
  \ high school and work and since then it has always been my wife and I, and occasionally\
  \ our other daughter who have taken care of this dog. I personally have fed, trained\
  \ and walked this dog almost every single day for 6 years. We've all grown incredibly\
  \ attached to him.\n\nOur son moved out a year ago on his 19th birthday to go to\
  \ college, and had to spend the first year on campus. He has since saved up and\
  \ moved into his own apartment. He now wants to take Toby with him, arguing that\
  \ Toby has always been his, as he was his birthday present and slept in his room\
  \ until a year ago. His new apartment is spacious and he is financially secure with\
  \ decent savings as he has a well paying part time job .\n\nHowever, him being able\
  \ to afford the dog isn't my concern. My wife, daughter and I feel that Toby is\
  \ part of our family. We've all treated him as our own, and have looked after him\
  \ as our own. I've covered food, thousands in vet bills, training and housing costs\
  \ till now, even after my son got a part time job in high school and could afford\
  \ to. Other than spending 6 years being the main person who looks after Toby, in\
  \ the year since my son left for college, Toby has spent almost every single second\
  \ we've been home by either my wife's side or mine. I feel like sending Toby away\
  \ would be like sending away a family member. Toby is also getting old, he has been\
  \ rushed to the vet multiple times in the last year and my son lives across state\
  \ lines. Toby already suffers from separation anxiety and this would be a big change\
  \ for him that I don't want him to be going through. He'd not just be going to a\
  \ new environment, he'd be going from a house where there's always someone home\
  \ to a house where my son would be away 9-5. At best, my son would hire a sitter\
  \ for those hours.\n\nSo I put my foot down and said no way.\n\nMy son cried and\
  \ was absolutely furious with me, he has threatened to cut us all off and has also\
  \ threatened to steal Toby away secretly and said we were depriving him of time\
  \ with his childhood dog in his last years. This is such a mess. AITA Reddit?\n\n\
  edit: I should probably mention..I'm not depriving my son of the dog. Before this\
  \ drama, he was visiting us one or two times every month, and he's welcome to visit\
  \ as often as he can. This is his home too.\n\nedit 2: Just adding some requested\
  \ info: We would not have gotten Toby at that point in time if not for how badly\
  \ my son wanted a a dog. Although my wife and I love dogs, we ideally wanted to\
  \ wait a few years as we were struggling really badly financially. Our son's birthday\
  \ came around, and he cried and begged and pleaded almost every single day. So we\
  \ gave him a choice, either he could have a normal present, or we could get a family\
  \ dog. My wife and I scraped together every last cent we had to be able to afford\
  \ the shelter fees, vaccinations, food, pet insurance, bowls, leash etc. I suppose\
  \ it wasn't a present so much as it was a dog in lieu of a present. We're in a much,\
  \ much better place now, but we honestly couldn't have afforded another present\
  \ on his birthday after that. Any extra dollars we had went straight into an emergency\
  \ fund for emergency vet bills that were bound to crop up (and did). I guess we\
  \ could have skimped on some dog expenses in order to buy our son a gameboy or something,\
  \ but like I said, a dog is a family member to us. If we were going to get a dog,\
  \ we had to make sure it was taken care of.\n\n edit 3:  I'm going to stop commenting\
  \ on this thread now but I'll read each and every single comment, I promise. Thank\
  \ you everyone for your opinions, even the ones I didn't agree with, and for all\
  \ the wonderful people who gave me tips on talking to my son. I love my kid, and\
  \ want this to end on a happy note for all of us, especially our silly good boy.\
  \ So I'll do my best in communicating with him and hope he'll understand that the\
  \ health of the dog comes first. I'll also try my best in talking to him about how\
  \ he's doing, and see if I can support him better. Perhaps he's lashing out due\
  \ to other problems I'm unaware about.\n\nI said the following in another comment,\
  \ but just wanted to leave it here: I asked to know if I was TA for keeping Toby,\
  \ and so I fully accept being told I'm the asshole for keeping the dog at home.\
  \ However being told I'm an asshole for not splurging on a second gift or a separate\
  \ gift just for him at that time is really frustrating.\n\nOur emergency dog vet\
  \ bill fund was being regularly depleted every second month that year, to pay for\
  \ food or for insurance or rent or well, emergency vet bills. The dog has always\
  \ been taken care of and our kids have always been well fed, but I'm not exaggerating\
  \ when I say 10$ was enough to send us into the red. Could I have gotten him a couple\
  \ of toys from the dollar store just so he'd have his own gift? Yes. But it honestly\
  \ wouldn't have made him happy anyway. I know what my kid liked/likes. That year\
  \ the only other thing he really wanted was a handheld Nintendo and we got it for\
  \ him for Christmas.\n\nIt was during the recession and there were times I wondered\
  \ if I should freeze my portion of dinner in case I couldn't put food on the table\
  \ next month. My wife and I spent all our time at work or thinking about work praying\
  \ we wouldn't get laid off yet again. The last thing we need is to be made to feel\
  \ guilty for not buying him another present, we did what we could. Give me a break.\n\
  \nEdit 4: Goddamnit stop dming me to tell me I'm a bad dad. Just vote me an asshole\
  \ like everyone else ffs"
