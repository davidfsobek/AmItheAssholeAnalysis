selftext: 'I was a "late bloomer" in the sense that I didn''t have my first drink
  until I was 19 (it''s legal at 18 here). All my friends started at 13-16 and they
  always tease me about what a good little responsible boy I was (uh, that''s right,
  bitch), and also because my tolerance level is super low. I''m 21 now, I drink maybe
  once every ca 2 months so I get drunk from a small lager, or like three sips of
  gin and tonic or something. Which is fine with me, I''d rather preserve my liver
  than be "cool".


  But my friends'' teasing is incessant. It''s like they believe getting hammered
  is a necessary rite of passage for me to become an adult. So this weekend at one
  of my friends'' birthday party, I came across an empty bottle of vodka while I was
  alone in the kitchen and an idea struck me. I filled it up with water, and I rubbed
  actual vodka all over the top of the bottle and the hand with which I was holding
  it. I took a glass with 1/4 orange juice and joined the others. When I was sure
  they can see what I''m doing, I filled the other 3/4 of the glass with "vodka".
  I downed it and made a face like ugh, disgusting.


  A friend laughed and came over to sniff the bottle and he was virtually slapped
  in the nostrils by the smell of the alcohol from my hand and the top of the bottle.
  People were shocked that I was able to drink all of it. Then I pretend-freaked out
  and said I was sick of them calling me a wuss, and I just started drinking the rest
  of the contents from the bottle. I almost drank all of it, when one of them literally
  jumped on me and punched the bottle out of my hand. It fell to the floor and broke.
  Then, another couple of them started freaking out calling me an idiot, saying *ohmygod
  ohmygod ohmygod call the ambulance, he''s going to kill himsel!!!* and so on. Within
  15 seconds, everyone was in panic mode, so I decided that was enough and I told
  them it was water. I said I found an empty bottle and put water in it, I wasn''t
  going to die and nobody needs to call the ambulance.


  They. Fucking. Lost. It. I don''t think even my mom shouted at me as much as some
  of them did. Everyone was so upset that they turned off the music and just sat there
  pouting and yelling at me in intervals. A few of the girls told me to go fuck myself
  and went home, and the party was over. Only two guys told me to ignore the rest
  of them and said "you got us good".


  Since it happened, I''ve been shunned during lunch at college, and the two girls
  that were the most upset left me on seen when I sent them an apology on Facebook.
  I don''t know if I''m in Twilight zone or I actually did something morally heinous.'

  out?
