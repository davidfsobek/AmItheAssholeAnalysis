selftext: "My (20) girlfriend (21) has a very severe phobia of cold things. We live\
  \ in England, so this is an issue for like, half of the year. She refuses to touch\
  \ anything that might be cold, including the floor with her feet in winter, door\
  \ handles, walls, cold water, absolutely anything. She has to run a full bath of\
  \ very hot water before she has a shower to 'make sure the floor isn't cold'. She\
  \ also will not eat cold food or drink cold drinks at any time of year. This means\
  \ that she drinks almost entirely tea and coffee (with the occasional hot juice),\
  \ meaning she's always anxious because of the sheer volume of caffiene she takes\
  \ in.\n\nIt's winter in the UK right now, so her phobia is in full swing. It's getting\
  \ ridiculous to see her refusing to do literally anything because she might have\
  \ to touch something cold. On Thursday, she left her slipper boots on the other\
  \ side of the bedroom (she had socks on, but took them off when she got in bed)\
  \ so she called in sick to work and stayed in bed all day. When I got back from\
  \ work, (I work 8-4, she woke up at about 11, so she waited about 5 and a half hours)\
  \ she was desperate for the toilet, really hungry, and distressed. Why didn't she\
  \ call someone to help her? Her phone was on the window ledge so it would be cold.\
  \ I told her that her this situation is \"ridiculous\", and she needs to \"get some\
  \ therapy\" because she can't live like this, and it's really impractical for her\
  \ to literally not go to work because of this. It's super annoying and I don't know\
  \ how she intends to get through life like this.\n\nShe was extremely upset and\
  \ told me that I'm an asshole for not taking her seriously, she said she realises\
  \ this is ridiculous but she can't help it. I told her she could help it if she\
  \ tried to get some help. \n\nJust to add, she is okay going outside in the cold\
  \ air, but as usual won't touch anything cold."
title: AITA for telling my girlfriend that her phobia is ridiculous and she needs
  treatment?
