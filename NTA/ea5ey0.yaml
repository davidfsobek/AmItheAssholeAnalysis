selftext: 'This is a question for both myself and my partner - are we the assholes?


  My partner and I got engaged several months ago. When we just started dating in
  our early twenties, we referred to each other as boyfriends. Now that''s we''re
  over 30, we mostly switched to partners. We do still occasionally refer to each
  other as boyfriends, but despite being engaged, we have never called each other
  fiance.


  For some reason, people from both his and my family as well as some friends go fucking
  insane any time they hear us use anything that isn''t "fiance". People have given
  us all sorts of reasons for why this is wrong: it''s lying because we aren''t just
  boyfriends, we''re fiances, and that''s a higher level; it''s diminishing the importance
  of an engagement; it''s diminishing the importance of marriage; we''re diminishing
  and disrespecting each other. We have even been told by one person she doesn''t
  view our engagement as serious because we refuse to use the term fiance, and she
  jokingly suggested that once we send out the invitations, she won''t rsvp as attending
  until she hears us use the "correct" word. (Boy is she going to be surprised when
  she finds out we''ll be inviting 23 people, none of which are her.)


  The more people demand of us to use the word fiance, the less we want to do it.
  It''s gotten so annoying, that we decided we''ll go down a notch and start calling
  each other friend or lower. My friend, my dear colleague, buddy, room mate and so
  on. Finally, the straw that broke the camel''s back was "friends with benefits".
  We were having lunch with our family at our place. I was telling a story about how
  I recently met someone who knows my partner, and when we realized we both knew him,
  I told her he''s my partner. Then, my SIL and MIL made that annoyed sound, and my
  sister said HE. IS. NOT. YOUR. PARTNER. To which I said, oh yes, sorry, my *long-term
  friend with benefits*.


  Our mothers and sisters were appalled (I don''t know what they thought, that we
  were saving ourselves for marriage for 11 years?), my brother had a problem with
  me using that expression in front of his 2.5 year old son who can''t even pronounce
  my name yet, let alone something like "friends with benefits", and the only person
  who enjoyed the joke was my father who snorted with laughter and made my mother
  even angrier. All the women in our family have reached the consensus that we''re
  asshole who are purposely trying to hurt them by making such "nasty jokes" and that
  it was high time to act like adults.'

  close friend, friend with benefits?
