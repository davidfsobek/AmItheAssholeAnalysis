selftext: 'I''ll open this up with a trigger warning, because I get that this could
  be offensive or upsetting to some people.


  My daughter is 16 years old and has an anxiety disorder. While I obviously cannot
  understand her unique experiences, I do understand what it is like to have anxiety
  and I try to support her as best as I can. I helped her set up appointments with
  therapists and doctors, and just generally try to be a good support system for her,
  as much as I can.


  However, for the past 6 months or so, she seems to be using her anxiety as a reason/excuse
  why she cannot do certain things. For example, I''ll ask her to help me do chores
  around the house and she''ll say that she''s feeling anxious so she can''t right
  now. I''ll ask her why she did poorly on a test, and she''ll say she felt really
  anxious the day before and couldn''t study. I sympathize with her feelings, but
  still, in my opinion, she has to try to push past it sometimes (easier said than
  done - I am absolutely aware).


  The incident in question happened the other day, when my sister was in town for
  one night who she almost never sees. They have a great relationship generally, and
  my sister loves her a lot. The three of us were going to go out for dinner, when
  half an hour before my daughter says she is having an anxiety attack and can''t
  come. I knew this would hurt my sister, so I told her that I understand she is struggling,
  but everyone has their own stuff going on and she can''t keep using her anxiety
  as an excuse to continually avoid doing things. I tried to use some tact, but also
  be upfront about how I felt. Also this is after *numerous* sit-down conversations
  where I have tried to help her work through her anxiety.


  My daughter started crying and calling me a bitch who will never understand what
  she''s going through. I said it''s true that I may not entirely understand, but
  that also doesn''t absolve her of any and all responsibilities. She slammed her
  bedroom door and hasn''t spoken to me since.


  AITA?'
