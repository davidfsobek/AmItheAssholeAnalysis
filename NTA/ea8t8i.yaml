selftext: "The handbook states \u201Cwe will not potty train your child.\u201D Clear\
  \ as day, in bold. Twice. \n\nSo I\u2019m the preschool teacher, I remember being\
  \ told at my interview that kids had to be potty trained to move up to the preschool\
  \ class. There are 3 that aren\u2019t. One is just straight up on diapers. One is\
  \ in pull ups but really close to just wearing underwear and being 100% potty trained.\
  \ The third one is neither. I\u2019m basically expected to potty train her. Her\
  \ parents complain about everything. They ask me to do things differently every\
  \ week. My boss asked me to potty train her (teacher her to pull her pants up and\
  \ down, sit on the potty, wipe, fish, all of it).\n\nI just got another talking\
  \ to about this kid and how I\u2019m doing \u201Cenough\u201D to help her. I explained\
  \ how I was told things would be from the beginning. I explained how the interview\
  \ and the handbook both said I wouldn\u2019t be potty training kids. And I said\
  \ they should change their handbook if they want me to change my classroom. \n\n\
  Am I the asshole? (I know I\u2019m an asshole in general, but in this particular\
  \ scenario am I THE asshole?)"

  says and what we actually do at work?
