selftext: "My little brother (26M) lives with my wife and I (30f/30M), he used to\
  \ live his GF, but since breaking up, he couldn't afford his own place so has been\
  \ living with us since July, rent free.\n\nMy wife is due with our first child any\
  \ day now (Her due date is Jan 2) and I have been working long hours at my job.\
  \ The company I work for is doing a merge, and I have been putting in longer hours\
  \ to try and get things done so that when my wife has our baby, I won't constantly\
  \ be pulled away or called while trying to support her and our son.\n\nMy little\
  \ brother works a trade that usually has next to no work during the winter (he does\
  \ roofing and siding for his friends dad, and we live in Canada) so lately, he's\
  \ just been sitting at home playing on his computer or going out with friends.\n\
  \nIt's been snowing here pretty heavy the last 3 days, and now that its finally\
  \ lightened up, we can  do the sidewalks. I called my wife on my break and she mentioned\
  \ that some of the kids that come by have a hard time getting through the snow (we\
  \ live by a school and on a corner lot, so we are responsible for shoveling the\
  \ side as well) \nI told her to get my brother to shovel the walks, she said she\
  \ asked him, but he told her he was  going out, (this was at about noon).\n\n I\
  \ texted my brother and asked what time he would be home, he said around 2, so I\
  \ asked him to shovel the walks when he got back, he asked when the last time I\
  \ shoveled them. I got annoyed and told him again to please shovel the walks as\
  \ I wouldn't be home till around 8, he didn't respond.\n\nI got home and saw they\
  \ were done, when I went inside, my wife was laying down and holding her stomach\
  \ (just some Braxton Hicks she said) I asked her if she was okay, and she said yes,\
  \ just exhausted from shoveling. I was furious. I asked her why my brother didn't\
  \ do it, and she said he refused as he is not the home owner. \n\nI went into our\
  \ basement and lost my shit at him, reminding him that he lived rent free in my\
  \ house and ate my food. He told me I was over reacting, that it was just snow,\
  \ and that him living there didn't mean he was obligated to do \"my chores\". I\
  \  told him to get out. He left and about a hour later I got a call from my mom\
  \ yelling at me to call my brother and apologies, that he has no where else to go,\
  \ and how I shouldn't be acting like this a few weeks before Christmas. I told her\
  \ he needed to apologize to my wife and I, and that if he wanted to come back, he\
  \ needs to be contributing going forward. \n\nHe ended up staying at a friend's\
  \ last night, and I have yet to hear from him, AITA here?\n\nEdit: just wanted to\
  \ add, my brother's response to  my wife shoveling was that she made that choice\
  \ to do that, as he told her to wait for me. I've also had a coworker tell me it\
  \ was a huge over reaction on my end, and that while my brother should apologize,\
  \ I should as well.\n\nEdit: thanks everyone for the responses, just to answer a\
  \ few questions though: \n\nMy wife told me it wasn't that big of a deal that she\
  \ ended up doing it (she still shouldn't of had to though) and in our city, we usually\
  \ have about 24 hours to clear the snow until a bylaw officer comes around, so I'm\
  \ surprised they weren't around sooner (I'm assuming it was due to the amount of\
  \ snow we were getting for 3 days straight) so that, plus my wife watching kids\
  \ struggle, plus us being liable for any injury was her reasoning for doing it.\n\
  \nSo yes I was mad that my very pregnant wife ended up doing it, but also his complete\
  \ lack of respect to her and myself, asking me when I had done it last, saying it\
  \ was a home owners job......\n\nAnd as for my mom, her and my dad live in one of\
  \ those 55+ retirement communities out in a county about 90 Min away, I guess he\
  \ could stay with them for a bit, but I think it has to be okayed with the condo\
  \ committee (I'm not sure how that works) \n\nI have also yet to hear back from\
  \ my brother in regards to my stipulations about him coming back.\n\nEdit: sorry,\
  \ one more thing since I see it coming up alot. In my Province and I believe most\
  \ of Canada, the Residential Tenancies Act doesn't apply to family members living\
  \ with landlords, he is in no way legally considered a tenant in my home, so unless\
  \ his name is on the deed to my house,  we can have him come and go as we so choose.\
  \ ( Not saying it isn't harsh for some situations, just wanted to clarify)"
