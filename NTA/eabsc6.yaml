selftext: "There is a restaurant somewhat near my work that has amazing subs. Fresh\
  \ baked bread, fancy cheese, home made condiments, exotic meats, gourmet farm to\
  \ fork shit. Seriously the best sandwiches I\u2019ve ever had. My company frequently\
  \ buys everyone lunch or reimburses people for lunch. This place is easily the most\
  \ popular.\n\nMy city has a lot of homeless and the shop isn\u2019t in the best\
  \ neighborhood. The homeless admittedly can get aggressive and cause problems for\
  \ local businesses.\n\nLast time I was at the sand which shop, I heard the owner,\
  \ Jerry, bragging to an employee that he reported a bum taking refuge under the\
  \ awning in the rain to cops for loitering &amp;amp; trespassing. Jerry went on\
  \ to say that while he was waiting for police to arrive, he dumped the contents\
  \ of the guys shopping cart into a puddle.\n\nThe experience left a bad taste in\
  \ my mouth. Like I can understand not wanting a hobo outside your restaurant, but\
  \ I feel super bad for the guy who got all his belongings wet.\n\nIdaf if employees\
  \ spend their own money there, I just don\u2019t want to support Jerry\u2019s establishment.\
  \ My decision has caused a lot of drama. AITA for banning company funds from being\
  \ used at Jerry\u2019s restaurant?\n\nEdit: I\u2019m the owner. I have a manager\
  \ who runs day-to-day operations. I take a percent of profit and the rest is shared\
  \ by employees and manager. The manager makes more than me, because he does more\
  \ and brings the dominant money in. That said, I reserve final say and it is at-will\
  \ employment. Company lunch funds saves everyone come tax season."
