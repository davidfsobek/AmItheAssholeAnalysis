selftext: "Throw away.\nMy son is 14. Soon to be ex wife and I were married for almost\
  \ 20 years.\nRecently found out she had been having an affair with co-worker. We\
  \ are getting a divorce, they are officially dating.\nI\u2019m crashing at a buddy\u2019\
  s place while I look for an apartment. \nMy son is torn up about it, and he\u2019\
  s confused. On our last visit he kept asking me questions like, if I still loved\
  \ his mom, why I didn\u2019t think she was attractive, basically trying to figure\
  \ out what happened. So, I told him. I told him that his mom had an affair, and\
  \ that\u2019s why out marriage is ending. He put two and two together and realized\
  \ that moms current boyfriend may be the culprit. \nHe has been a nightmare at home\
  \ ever since. Cursing, and screaming at his mother and being defiant. She doesn\u2019\
  t want to put up with him. I told her what I told him, and she was very upset. She\
  \ thinks I\u2019m a huge asshole, but I don\u2019t want to lie to my son. I\u2019\
  m willing to take him after I find a place. My buddy also thinks it was an asshole\
  \ move, and I\u2019m very disappointed with the way that he is acting, I didn\u2019\
  t expect it. Was i an asshole for this? It\u2019s been tearing me up, wondering\
  \ if I did the right thing.\n\nEdit:\n A lot of people are worrying about custody,\
  \ and me leaving the home. There\u2019s not going to be a custody battle, my son\
  \ wants to live with me. He will be as soon as I find a place."
