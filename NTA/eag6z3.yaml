selftext: "We have a coworker who came back in for the first day since losing her\
  \ daughter. \n\nEveryone told her how glad we were to see her back and how sorry\
  \ we were. \n\nAt lunch people were sharing stories about how they overcame grief\
  \ of immediate family (no one else had lost a kid but, like, spouses, siblings,\
  \ and parents.) At some point the coworker said (abridged) losing my daughter just\
  \ feels so different than when I lost my dad and was telling her story. \n\nThen\
  \ another coworker chimes in that she understands exactly what this woman is going\
  \ through losing her daughter because she just lost her dog and her dog had been\
  \ like a child to her and she would probably never have kids so it was the closest\
  \ she\u2019d ever come and how difficult it was and how sudden...\n\nI cut in and\
  \ said \u201CLosing a dog is not like losing a kid. This isn\u2019t a good time\
  \ to be telling this story. Read the room.\u201D And she said the dog was like a\
  \ child to her and was her fur baby talked about all the sacrifices she made for\
  \ it and how close they were and I told her she was being immature and inappropriate\
  \ and capped it off with \u201Ca dog is fine and it\u2019s not easy to lose a pet\
  \ but it is not comparable to losing a human child and you need to stop.\u201D \n\
  \nA few other coworkers nodded in agreement and the grieving mother was uncomfortable\
  \ and quickly finished her lunch and left. \n\nLater someone told me the coworker\
  \ I went off on about the dog is infertile and I really hurt her feelings telling\
  \ her the loss of her fur baby was not as significant as the coworker\u2019s and\
  \ I should apologize.\n\nI don\u2019t know if there\u2019s now another layer to\
  \ this that I didn\u2019t understand before and I\u2019m an asshole now. \n\nI\u2019\
  m... I just feel bad all directions. Should I have kept my mouth shut? AITA?"
