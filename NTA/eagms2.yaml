selftext: "My brother-in-law lost his job about 1 month ago and his family (2 adults,\
  \ 2 kids) are going to need a place to stay since they can't afford their apartment\
  \ anymore among other things. They asked if they could move in with us. \n\n&#x200B;\n\
  \nFor many years my brother-in-law and sister-in-law have bragged about how much\
  \ money they have, all the nice things they buy and how much better their things\
  \ are than mine. These have not been passing comments; these were usually direct\
  \ statements. Years ago they moved into these fancy new luxury apartments that cost\
  \ a fair amount more per month than my mortgage. Every other year they get two new\
  \ leased cars. Their clothing always must have the big-name logo on them. Fancy\
  \ watches and I could go on. I've just learned to ignore them since I was certain\
  \ they lived way past their means. I also spend as little time around them as I\
  \ can since they almost always make a scene wherever they go. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTheir\
  \ kids are also jerks who have no comprehension of right and wrong or respect of\
  \ people's property. They are 10 and 12 and should understand this. The last time\
  \ they were over our house, the older kid put a hole in my basement wall with his\
  \ foot. I asked the parents to pay for the repair, they were not willing to do that\
  \ since \"kids are kids\" and we should expect that to happen. I dropped the issue\
  \ and paid a local handyman the $100 to repair it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy wife and I\
  \ have done the opposite. We never discuss money or purchases with anyone. We are\
  \ dumping as much as we can into our 401k's, emergency fund, mortgage, have a college\
  \ fund for our kid and set aside money for fun. I'm not saying that my wife's and\
  \ my way is perfect, but we do plan for the future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI must be right\
  \ that they lived beyond their means because they must not have any savings since\
  \ they can't make it a couple months with severance and unemployment checks.\n\n\
  &#x200B;\n\nThe first time they contacted us was to ask to borrow money. It was\
  \ about the equivalent of 6 months of mortgage payments. I told my wife that I did\
  \ not want to do this since I have huge doubts that we would ever be paid back.\
  \ They wanted the money so they could keep up their lifestyle instead of cutting\
  \ back and make it last as long as possible. Also, I just did not want to bail them\
  \ out of a problem they created.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe next time they contacted us\
  \ was to ask to move in with us (we are their only family on this side of the state).\
  \ I just can't. I talked with my wife and she understands and agrees, but the \"\
  family\" part is what is troubling her. They also refuse to ask their friends if\
  \ they can stay with them for unknown reasons. Apparently our decision has made\
  \ the rounds with cousins, aunts, uncles, parents, etc and I'm being accused (just\
  \ me - not my wife) of being unreasonable for not opening up our home to them. \n\
  \n&#x200B;\n\nAm I the asshole for keeping my home as is and not bailing their family\
  \ out of a self-created problem?"
