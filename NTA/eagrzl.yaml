selftext: 'I (F20s) and a British person living with my husband in the States for
  work. Previously I worked from home and went into the office a few times a month
  but  things have changed and I now work in-office Mon-Wed. Everyday around noon
  someone does a Starbucks run for the office staff (12 people). Management pays for
  our drinks and food items on the Starbucks run so no employee pays out of pocket.
  Essentially we are being given free Starbucks via gift card and a different person
  goes and gets it each day.


  I''ve only been working in-office on a three day schedule for ~~two and a half weeks~~
  three and a half weeks~~.~~ The first couple times I worked I was forgotten. However
  this also happened to the guy who started when I joined and we both have out-of-the-way
  offices and being new we just weren''t thought of. Apologies were made and no hard
  feelings for that. Being English I enjoy a nice cup of hot tea. However, my first
  week I declined a drink because I had brought with me a bottle of juice and it was
  still warm, but I did ask for a pastry, and was given the pastry.


  The next week I worked it had finally gotten colder so I requested a tea. That first
  day my tea was forgotten but not my pastry. The second day the runner scoffed and
  called my order silly. Both my tea and my pastry were forgotten. The third day the
  runner told me straight up he wouldn''t buy me a tea because it''s a silly drink.
  I hadn''t reported this to management because I''m new and didn''t want to make
  waves. No one else has been forgotten or mocked. I don''t want to jump the xenophobic
  conclusions and I''m not sure if I''m just being hazed.


  ~~This recent Wednesday I came in and was told I was to be the one making the coffee
  run.~~ (Screwed up my time-frame a little, this happened LAST week, not this week).  I
  politely declined and said that since my own order was always such trouble I would
  not be participating any longer and therefore would not be doing the runs at any
  time in the future or that day. I got a load of shit and later, a stern lecture
  from the manager, during which time I informed her of the previously issues. This
  culminated in the entire coffee run being canceled and management announcing we
  are now responsible for our own drinks.


  My husband felt bad for me and bought me a little personal Kurig for my office and
  some of my favorite drink pods. I brought it to the office and keep it in the cut-out
  in my desk where the tower used to go when they used desktops. My office is glass
  walls and I have a door and I haven''t let anyone use my Kurig and take it home
  when I''m going to be out.


  AITA for not sticking to the status quo and also having a Kurig I don''t share?


  ETA: I edited to correct the time-frame, I''ve been in office three and a half weeks,
  this happened last week. Since the day this happened my coworkers have been treating
  me very coldly and have been ostracizing me. I''ve also had several requests to
  leave my Keurig at the office and let others use it. I''ve said no and people argue
  with me and act as though they are owed my Keurig because "you''re the reason we
  don''t have the Starbucks card now".'

  and then putting a Keurig in my office?
