selftext: "My little brother (11) has a terrible habit of leaving his school papers\
  \ all over the table. \n\nI was clearing them away so we could eat and noticed a\
  \ paper really out of place with girly handwriting and heart doodles in the margins.\
  \ \n\nI was curious and on autopilot so pulled it out and looked at it and realized\
  \ it was a copy of his upcoming science exam. I know, because I had his science\
  \ teacher and it was one of the exact same exams I took. \n\nIt didn\u2019t take\
  \ a rocket scientist to realize he\u2019d bought a copy to cheat off of. I still\
  \ can\u2019t believe it. That\u2019s really not like him, I swear. \n\nI went to\
  \ his room and confronted him with it and told him all the reasons cheating is ultimately\
  \ not worth and that I\u2019d help him study. But I wasn\u2019t getting through\
  \ so finally I tried telling him the exams change every year, but he knew I was\
  \ lying about that, because everyone knows about this teacher. (The exams come with\
  \ the textbook and the teacher is too lazy to mix up the letters from the original\
  \ answer key.)\n\nI really didn\u2019t want my brother to get into the habit of\
  \ cheating but I knew if I told my parents anything they did would just teach him\
  \ to not get caught, it wouldn\u2019t teach him not to cheat. So I figured experience\
  \ is the best teacher. \n\nI went to the science teacher and told her I\u2019d come\
  \ across a copy of her exam for sale so she should be careful.\n\nSurprise surprise,\
  \ my brother failed his exam. He\u2019s in huge trouble and he knows somethings\
  \ up with my finding out and the exam suddenly changing. The \u201Ccheating isn\u2019\
  t worth the risk\u201D lesson didn\u2019t sink in and all he got was \u201Cmy brother\
  \ is a two faced dick.\u201D\n\nI feel awful, but I wouldn\u2019t have wanted to\
  \ just not do anything, either... AITA?"
