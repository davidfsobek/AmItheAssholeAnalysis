selftext: "I've been in my property for one year. Since then, not once has my \"Karen\"\
  neighbour wished me good morning or even said hello when we cross paths, or introduced\
  \ herself when I moved in.\n\nInstead i have had 2 passive aggressive notes through\
  \ my door, one complaining about crisp packets and sweet wrappers in my front garden\
  \ (this is actually my other neighbours disabled son who doesn't know any better)\n\
  \n\"Hi, can you please not throw litter in your front garden\" \n\nand another just\
  \ recently about my gate banging in the wind (it doesn't, I checked) \n\n\"Hi just\
  \ to let you know your side gate isn't bolted and bangs during the night\" \n\n\
  This morning she had a builder commence building her a new shed at 0720 on a Saturday\
  \ morning, crashing wood around and using a loud saw/hammering waking me up. \n\
  I KNOW I would have got another note for this. \n\nI wrote one myself\n\n\"Hi, just\
  \ to let you know that a builder was sawing wood in your garden at 0730 this morning.\
  \ You may now stop posting passive-aggressive notes through my door\" \n\nAm i the\
  \ asshole, or just petty?\n\nUPDATE : \n\nKaren my estranged neighbour replied by\
  \ posting another note through my door\n\n\" I was not being aggressive, I was just\
  \ letting you know your gate was unlocked that was all!!!\"\nThe \"That was all\"\
  \ had two exclamation marks and was double underlined so i guess this means it's\
  \ war... (joke)\n\nFunny thing is she didn't even mention the builders or apologise\
  \ for the previous notes or this mornings noise. Why mention the noise my gate was\
  \ making at all if she just was just wanting me to me to bolt it? Why mention the\
  \ rubbish at all if I can see it right there? I'm not fucking Stevie Wonder Karen....\n\
  She currently has her boyfriend parked in my second parking space, I don't use it\
  \ often but it's the principle to at least ask first (now that's petty)\n\nI should\
  \ also add that i'm British and leaving notes through people's doors that you haven't\
  \ been introduced to (or even acknowledge their existence with a slight nod when\
  \ you cross paths) is not the normal neighbourly etiquette...\n\nCheers for the\
  \ input guys, pretty split decision so far keep it coming."
