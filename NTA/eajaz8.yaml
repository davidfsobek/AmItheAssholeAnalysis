selftext: "My mom remarried my stepdad 2 years ago. My stepdad is a really nice guy\
  \ but his kids are fucking nightmares. He has 3 of them, a pair of 8 year old twin\
  \ boys and a 12 year old girl. They\u2019re really really spoiled and although my\
  \ stepdad and my mom try and discipline them it\u2019s half assed. They\u2019re\
  \ both child models (the boys) and because of that are entitled and annoying. My\
  \ stepsister is cool tho. \n\nHe has custody of them so they live at my mom and\
  \ stepdads place all the time. I\u2019m 15, and decided I didn\u2019t want to live\
  \ with them for personal reasons so I moved in with my grandma and grandad from\
  \ my dads side. \n\nNow I\u2019m basically forced by my mom and my grandparents\
  \ to go visit every weekend so when I do I\u2019ll take my stepsis a game of mine\
  \ or something because we both have a switch but I\u2019ll also take snacks and\
  \ not share them with anybody. I just keep them in my room hidden and eat them in\
  \ there and nobody knows any different. \n\nThe reason for that is because my grandparents\
  \ have a no junk rule in the house but my grandpa gave me the idea to take snacks\
  \ over to my moms place so I get to indulge on the weekend. \n\nWhen I got to my\
  \ mom and stepdads place last week I had some Swedish fish and hid them under my\
  \ pillow. The boys ran into my room at some point in the day and discovered them.\
  \ They starting yelling about how they want my candy and snacks etc. \n\nMy mom\
  \ was pissed at me and said if I\u2019m bringing stuff in the house it should be\
  \ for everyone. I said that was dumb logic since her and my stepdad hide the good\
  \ hot chocolate so they can secretly have it when the kids aren\u2019t around. \n\
  \nMy stepdad told them to put the candy back but asked if I would consider sharing.\
  \ I said no bc honestly they\u2019re brats and I shouldn\u2019t have been in my\
  \ room in the first place BUT I will be happy to share with my stepsister. \n\n\
  My stepdad said that was fine but my mom is still annoyed, AITA?"
