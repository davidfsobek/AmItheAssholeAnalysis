selftext: "Context: My BIL has been going through some serious mental issues related\
  \ to depression.  Basically, he has been kind of cutting himself off from everyone.\
  \  Friends, family, etc.  He has a huge victim complex and feels like the world\
  \ is out to get just him.  My wife and I along with my FIL and MIL have been trying\
  \ for months to get him to open up again and do family and friend gathering stuff.\
  \  FINALLY after months of trying, BIL out of the blue wants to host Christmas at\
  \ his apartment.  He seems genuinely excited about it.\n\nSUCCESS, right?  Not so\
  \ much, apparently.  After this big breakthrough, my MIL has the audacity to tell\
  \ him/us as a group that she doesn't want to do Christmas at his apartment and instead\
  \ wants to do it at my and my wife's house again because \"I want to have a real\
  \ Christmas and Christmas dinner\".  The implication being that BIL's apartment\
  \ was not good enough to host a small family gathering.  This just makes everything\
  \ awkward and in my opinion, was an extremely rude thing to say to anyone, let alone\
  \ to someone suffering from depression and making an attempt at a social gathering.\n\
  \nThis immediately pissed me off.  It caused my BIL to basically lose all the interest\
  \ he had in the holidays.  He has reverted back to probably not even joining us\
  \ this Christmas and wife and I are in the awkward spot of possibly hosting Christmas\
  \ while coaxing BIL to come after MIL just took a giant shit on him.Anyway, I told\
  \ my wife that night that MIL was, \"Being a ridiculous, petty bitch that she would\
  \ ruin your brother's one time he made a real effort and it was on Christmas.\"\
  \  Wife insists I am being an asshole for seeing it that way and that MIL \"just\
  \ wants a nice Christmas dinner\".\n\nI still stick to my guns that MIL was being\
  \ a rude, petty...well...bitch.  What do you guys think?  AITA here?\n\nEDIT (INFO):\
  \ BIL lives alone in a 3 bedroom apt and there would be 5 of us there.  More than\
  \ enough room to be comfortable.  \n\n\nEDIT (CLARITY): Victim complex was not intended\
  \ as an insult or \"eye-rolling\", dismissive remark.  He has other tendencies that\
  \ can only be defined as a victim complex, where he views other peoples' harmless\
  \ actions as malicious attempts to spite him even when he is not involved.    \n\
  \n\nAlso, yes, I have every intent of checking in on BIL and will put my foot down\
  \ about hosting Christmas at our place.  Reading through the comments (I can't possibly\
  \ reply to all of them, but I am grateful) I see a lot of people identifying with\
  \ BIL here and I am thankful for your input and for sharing your perceptions.  There\
  \ is no way I'm letting him spend Christmas alone, even if he fights it a bit."
