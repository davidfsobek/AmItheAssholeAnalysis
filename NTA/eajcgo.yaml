selftext: 'There is a lot of back story here and a lot of history- this is also my
  first post so I''ll do my best.


  I''m currently nine months pregnant with my boyfriends second child, the first of
  which belonging to another woman. I try to be as understanding as I can with their
  relationship, keeping in mind they have a child together that they are both involved
  with. However, I feel as though he does many things that cross lines and boundaries.
  For instance, he stays up to all hours of the night (4 or 5am) snapchatting and
  texting her. Meanwhile he is possessive of his phone, not letting it out of arms
  reach and changing his password and turning away while using it. Early into our
  relationship, 3 or 4 months, I had his phone and he admitted to me he had a folder
  full of her nudes still. I told him he needed to get rid of them, as it is insensitive
  to me to have them and quite frankly creepy and seemingly a breach of her boundaries.
  He refused for about a week even going so far as to ask me if he could keep them
  elsewhere, such as on a flashdrive. He eventually complied and deleted them. Now,
  she works late hours, usually not coming home until four in the morning and won''t
  let him watch their son anywhere but at her home. He tends to fall asleep while
  waiting for her and doesn''t come home until late morning or sometimes even the
  early afternoon. I offer to stay up and pick him up so he doesn''t have to sleep
  on her couch five nights a week, but even if he agrees to this he won''t answer
  his phone and will stay until whatever time he chooses to leave.


  Most recently, he admitted to me that he shows her our text conversations. I assume
  he is meaning only the ones where I''m trying to express to him why I''m uncomfortable
  with how he sleeps there so often. This made me really angry and upset, I felt betrayed.
  I keep trying to tell him that he is crossing all kinds of boundaries and I am not
  okay with it. I tell him he needs to stop texting her every night until dawn, especially
  when he''s at her house alone at those times most nights out of the week, but he
  tells me I''m controlling him. He tells me that it''s unacceptable that I''m telling
  him who he can and can''t talk to.


  Am I being controlling or am I within my rights to feel this way?'
