selftext: 'Sunday, my best friend went from finishing up a solid workout with me at
  the gym to being in the ICU completely paralyzed from the neck down, in tremendous
  pain, breathing through a tube unable to speak in a matter of hours. We''re both
  in our mid-20''s and wouldn''t have seen something like this happen in a million
  years. She''s always been the strong one - kind, works with trauma and is getting
  her masters in therapy. She''s that person that is just so happy, genuine, hard-working,
  and super strong it''s almost annoying. She''d been in the neuroICU for 5 days unable
  to talk (outside of a alphabet chart I made in which she can blink on letters as
  are fingers cross it for her to make words). I have NEVER seen someone in so much
  tremendous pain, frustration, anxiety, and panic.


  I''d been pretty strong for the first 4 days ago, but by the 4th day, despite me
  trying to "take breaks", "eat", and "sleep" the stress was taking it''s toll. Yesterday,
  when I walked into the room, she immediately gave me a look of desperation. I held
  up the communication chart and she spelled out, "Can I please stop?". And this is
  girl is no quitter. Seeing that written on the board hit me like a brick. I told
  her no. That she''s got to be strong and fight and kick ass harder than she''s ever
  had to in her life. However, my voice was cracking really badly. Her sedation kicked
  in a bit and she closed her eyes again. I rushed beside her bed, where my face was
  out of view, stroked her hair (one of the few things that calms her down since they
  can''t up her sedatives), and bawled as soundlessly as one can.


  A nurse came in and in front of my friend, called me out, said "as much pain as
  you''re in, hers is 100x worse, and your crying in the room is only going to make
  her more anxious and feel worse," along with, "she was doing fine before you arrived."
  I got incredibly angry, and we pulled the conversation into the hall. While she
  had some valuable things to say for sure, I disagree that crying in front of her
  is a bad thing. She needed something familiar to cling to and be honest with, and
  if that makes me cry, who cares. It''s a fucking super shitty situation, and crying
  is going to happen. At the same time, I also can''t even come close to imagining
  the fear and pain she is going through. Is is my job to be strong when she is not,
  and I need to do a better job of holding it together and being strong and keeping
  things light and upbeat and faking it?


  I''ve never experienced a situation even close to this. There is no handbook. I''m
  way out of my league and just want to do what''s best for her. What do you guys
  think?

  EDIT: God Damn it, Reddit. You guys are awesome. I feel so much more validated and
  appreciate your advice and support more than you know. If you''d like to keep up
  to date on the her status, feel free to check out her gofundme at [gf.me/u/w6udyb](https://gf.me/u/w6udyb).
  Its the only public forum I will be updating regularly. (Oh, and we''re in America,
  and as you are well aware, there is simply no way for her to come out of this without
  a financial scar, so if you''d like to pitch in a few bucks, we won''t argue. Again,
  thanks for being such a great outlet and support system during such a shitty, emotional,
  wreck of a situation.'
title: AITA for crying in front of my hospitalized best friend when she is definitely
  in more pain than me?
