selftext: "I know it sounds bad but here's the story. I  (62f)  live with my husband\
  \ (65m) who I my kids stepfather. I had 3 kids with my first husband who passed\
  \ away a few years ago, they are all relatively successful. 2 of them have moved\
  \ out but one still lives with me, which I don't mind, but I think it's time that\
  \ they be on their own as the others are.\n\n\nOldest kid: 30 Male. Moved out years\
  \ ago, lives with his wife and the recently had their first baby.\n\nMiddle Kid:\
  \ 27 Female. Married for 2 years, her and her husband live with me while they save\
  \ up for a place.\n\nYoungest: 22 Female. Lives in a college dorm in another city.\
  \ \n\nEver since my son and Dil had their baby, my oldest daughter has been baby\
  \ crazy and has been constantly talking about how she can't wait to be a mom. I\
  \ love my daughter but I don't want a baby in the house. I stopped at 3 for a reason.\
  \  I don't want her to live here forever, I want her and her husband to have their\
  \ own lives, while my husband and I to have our own lives by ourselves. \nA couple\
  \ nights ago at dinner I sat her down and told her my reasoning and told her that\
  \ if she wants a baby that badly then her and her husband need to start looking\
  \ for their own place. \nShe didn't take it too well and called me selfish and that\
  \ I only think about myself. Which right now is true, for 30 years i've put my kids\
  \ first and now I want to put myself first. I hardly think I'm selfish for that.\n\
  I tried to explain my reasoning and her husband said he understood but I know he\
  \ was angry too. My husband is on my side and says I'm nta. \nFor the past week\
  \ my daughter and son in law have been ignoring me an only talks to me when its\
  \ necessary. \n\nI told some friends about what happened and most understand where\
  \ I'm coming from but a couple said that I am TA as it wouldn't matter because its\
  \ not my baby so I wouldn't have any responsibility towards it. \n\nI don't know\
  \ what to do, I don't want my daughter to hate me but I'm getting older and I would\
  \ like for my kids to be independent while my husband and I can enjoy retirement\
  \ together. \n\nAITA?"
