selftext: "I am a retired man on a pension. I don\u2019t get much money and I have\
  \ to live frugally. \n\nMy daughter had an affair with the man she is now. This\
  \ broke up her marriage. the new family member is a 15 year old teenage girl who\
  \ is technically my step grandchild now. I don\u2019t see her often nor do I know\
  \ her. She lives with her mom. My daughter and her husband married as soon as her\
  \ divorce was finalized 18 months ago. \n\nThis has been extremely hard on my grandson.\
  \ He is 17 and moody, angry, upset, lashing out at his mom. He doesn\u2019t want\
  \ to live with her but his dad hasn\u2019t got a stable home due to the divorce.\
  \ \n\nMy grandson is in need of someone \u2018in his corner\u2019. I decided. I\
  \ wanted to gift him some money for Christmas. Normally I don\u2019t give cash to\
  \ any family member but I want to help him. He is not dealing well. I gave him the\
  \ money in secret and asked that he invest wisely. Not blow it on girls or pot.\
  \ He said he will buy a car, I said okay. \n\nMy daughter found the cash in my sons\
  \ room after doing a \u2018random\u2019 search and wanted to know where the money\
  \ came from. I told her the truth so she would not suspect my grandson of wrongdoing.\
  \ She told her partner and they both want me to take my gift back because my stepdad\
  \ grand daughter is left out. \n\nI don\u2019t want to take the gift back. My grandson\
  \ needs to know someone is thinking of him. I do not feel I am obligated to gift\
  \ money to someone else\u2019s child just because their parent has a skewed vision\
  \ of what is fair. I will gift the girl some chocolate on Christmas and I think\
  \ that is appropriate. \n\nMy wife has passed away and I have no one to ask so I\
  \ am hoping the internet will be of some use. Thank you."
