selftext: "For some background I\u2019m (24f) working mum, I work on average 65 hours\
  \ a week, 12 hour shifts generally so I don\u2019t see my daughter (2y) often. When\
  \ I leave she\u2019s asleep and when I get back she\u2019s sleeping too. \n\nAnyway,\
  \ I have 10 days off and we have been having fun together, exploring outside parks,\
  \ painting and playing in the pool. I\u2019ve been really enjoying it. I left some\
  \ of the paintings to dry on the kitchen table and just now if I asked my husband\
  \ (28) if he threw them out he said \u201Cyes\u201D. \n\nHonestly, I was in shock,\
  \ I started to whimper (mainly to prevent myself from screaming). He said I should\
  \ have told him not to throw them out, I said I shouldn\u2019t have to tell him\
  \ not to throw it out because everyone knows not to throw away kids artwork. I said\
  \ he was stupid, and an idiot. \n\nHe then proceeds to say that the artwork didn\u2019\
  t look impressive and just splashes of colour on paper. I said \u201Cno shit she\u2019\
  s only two\u201D. There was also a few fuck you and fucks in my side of the exchange,\
  \ but I can\u2019t recall where.\n\nAlso, my in-laws just arrived in the house and\
  \ he told me to calm down. But I still exploded. \n\nSo reddit AITA?\n\nEdit to\
  \ clarify:\n\nNobody was near me when we shared the interaction. It wasn\u2019t\
  \ a screaming or yelling fit and my \u201Cfuck you\u201D was in response to excuses\
  \ he made about why it was thrown out. \n\nHowever, despite saying that, I do realise\
  \ how I handled it was wrong, I kind of thought it was, which is why I asked. So\
  \ thank you to everyone for your input."
