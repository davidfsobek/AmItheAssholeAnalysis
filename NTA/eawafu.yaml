selftext: "I recently got married and had a fall theme. For my wedding I made our\
  \ cake myself. It was a basically a pumpkin bread flavored cake in the shape of\
  \ a 3D pumpkin. I was pretty proud of it and from the scraps it tasted really good.\n\
  \nA couple days before the wedding my mother-in-law mentioned that her daughters\
  \ (15 and 10) made a cake \"because she wanted to do something for the wedding.\
  \ And it looks really good.\" I suppose this part's on me because I just think she's\
  \ saying they made a cake for an after party or something. \n\nWedding day comes,\
  \ I walk into the reception with the cake I made and I see another cake. It's a\
  \ small-ish cake with white frosting and over decorated with purple frosting. Like\
  \ it made me think they got some piping bag with a couple different shaped tips\
  \ and went to town all over the place.\n\nI didn't say anything and still haven't,\
  \ but I was really mad about it. I later heard from someone else that the real reason\
  \ they made the cake was because \"not everyone likes pumpkin.\"\n\nIt's definitely\
  \ been a couple weeks since the wedding but I'm still steaming about it and I want\
  \ to say something. Would I be the asshole?"
