selftext: "So, yesterday I (16) went to B&M (a cheap shop in the UK) with my girlfriend\
  \ (16) and my parents, mainly to get scissors as I've been needing some for a while\
  \ as I do graphics in college, and some Christmas presents (some small things).\
  \ So anyway when we were done looking we went to the till to pay, my girlfriend\
  \ had a candle (a gift) some other stuff and amongst it was a small bottle of nail\
  \ polish remover (she was wearing nail polish at the time). The woman on the till\
  \ said she can't sell it as you need to be 18 to buy things like that apparently.\
  \ My parents then stepped in and said they'll buy it to which the woman on the till\
  \ said she cant sell it as she knows its for her. We were all shocked and kinda\
  \ irritated (she only wanted to do her nails). Didn't take it out on the woman as\
  \ shes just doing her job. So when they put the nail polish remover to the side\
  \ and she paid for her stuff it was my turn to pay. I was buying a small Lego movie\
  \ 2 set, a batman rubber duck (because why wouldn't I?) and finally, the pair of\
  \ scissors I came in there for (only \xA31.69) and she said \"i'm going to need\
  \ to do the same thing for these\" I replied \"Really?\", bearing in mind i'm over\
  \ 6 foot and probably look older than 16, to which she replied \"yes, they're scissors!\"\
  \ as if I knew that scissors can't be sold to me. Again, parents (who look and are\
  \ very responsible stepped in and said the same thing to the same reply). After\
  \ everyone else questioned it she started scanning my other stuff. She got the Lego,\
  \ scanned it and said in a kind of patronising, smug way \"Benny's... hmph\" (the\
  \ set was Benny's space adventure) I hate buying things like that in public as I\
  \ know people will judge me for it and now its probably gonna be even more difficult\
  \ to get that sort of thing in future. Anyway I paid and she placed the change firmly\
  \ in my hand and we left.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGonna add this here, we weren't taking\
  \ it out on the cashier as it was the company's policy but she was kinda rude.\n\
  \nAlso right now I'm applying for a provisional licence for ID in future and i'll\
  \ be driving in a few months, funny how i'm allowed to drive a 4000 pound vehicle\
  \ but not but a pair of scissors.\n\nAnother thing, I asked my brother who works\
  \ in Tesco and he said they shouldn't have refused me.\n\nTL:DR: girlfriend and\
  \ I tried to buy scissors and nail polish from B&M and got refused as we're 16.\n\
  \nEdit: Went back out today to different stores and got the nail polish remover\
  \ no problem and scissors were fine when my parents agreed for me to get them to\
  \ the cashier."
