selftext: 'He''s been married 4 times now, and this wedding will be his fifth in the
  span of 30 years. I don''t know how he has such a high turnover rate but I''m guessing
  it''s to do with him being both rich and a raging narcissist. He invited me to get
  coffee and introduced me to his new fiancee. I knew he was going to do this because
  two of my brothers (there are 7 of us total, none have the same mother) said that
  they had just gotten coffee with dad and met the fiancee, then been invited to the
  wedding, and both had been given a plus one for their girlfriends of 8 and 10 months
  respectively.


  Dad told me to bring my "partner" when I came for coffee and I brought my (trans)
  boyfriend along. We have been together for 3 years. The fiancee seemed nice, wanting
  to know about me and my boyfriend and asking questions that sounded like she actually
  gave a shit. Dad gets all the details of the engagement/wedding out of the way and
  then asks me, and only me, if I''ll be there.


  I notice that he was talking to just me, not my boyfriend, so I say "*we* will check
  if *we''re* free".


  Dad replies that "this is family only"


  I reply, "I just assumed, seeing as how the other siblings got plus ones"


  Dad says "that''s different. Are you coming?"


  I say "we''ll catch the next one".


  Dad''s fiancee becomes visibly upset and they leave. Dad texts me after that if
  I can be civil on the day then I can still come alone.


  I felt like I had to stick up for my boyfriend because this was definitely due to
  him being transgender, and he thanked me at the time but told me that I should probably
  still go, but after reporting back to my siblings to say what had happened I got
  mixed responses. The overall opinion was that while I absolutely should stick up
  for my boyfriend this was some hill to die on and I managed to catch the actually
  nice fiancee in the crossfire and upset dad, too.


  AITA?


  Info: I am a woman. My boyfriend is trans FTM. Despite both of us being straight,
  dad thinks of us as lesbians due to my boyfriend''s biology. Of me and my siblings,
  3 were within wedlock and the other 4 (including me) were extramarital: 3 affairs,
  1 long term girlfriend. The fiancee knows she''s #5 and dad gives the same story
  about how he was tricked into marrying golddiggers by accident and didn''t know
  until too late and the affairs all happened as the relationships were breaking down.'
title: AITA for telling my father "we'll catch the next one" when he invited me to
  his wedding?
