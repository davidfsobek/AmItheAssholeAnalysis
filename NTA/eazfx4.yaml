  \ the other day because of it.\n\nAfter I finished up the owner and I got to talking.\
  \ He asked me me what size shoe I wear and gave me a five pairs of their newest\
  \ styles for free.\n\nWhen I got home I immediately started trying them on. I love\
  \ shoes. My girlfriend was home and asked me how I got all the shoes (we\u2019re\
  \ on a budget). I told her how I got them as a gift from my client.\n\nMy gf is\
  \ now mad that I didn\u2019t ask to get a couple of the styles in her size instead\
  \ of mine. I really just didn\u2019t think about it at the time because it was all\
  \ very sudden, but I feel like it would have been rude to ask and possibly make\
  \ my client feel a little awkward."
