selftext: "Im a germaphobe, to put it simply. I really enjoy my girlfriends company\
  \ and her personality, but her hygiene concerns me. She says she only showers once\
  \ a week, and accumulates alot of grease and dirt. It kind of kills me, so I talked\
  \ to her about it and asked her to please shower more often. She doesn't think she\
  \ needs to because she has thick hair, and doesn't really understand how much it\
  \ turns me off in general. I get alot of people only shower once per week, so I'm\
  \ not sure if its just me or not. AITA?\n\nEDIT: \nSorry if some of my phrasing\
  \ is confusing. Here's a few questions I get asked often and a little side note.\
  \ \n\nQ- Does she not wash at all for one week or only her hair?\n\nA- She does\
  \ not wash in general for a week+, she has a schedule she tends to stick to. Sundays\
  \ are usually her shower days. How often she washes her hands is unknown to me.\
  \ \n\nQ- Why are you still with her?\n\nA- I believe we can find a compromise that\
  \ makes both of us happy. I enjoy her company and don't want it to go to waste because\
  \ of this. \n\nI talked to her a bit more about it tonight and she says she'll take\
  \ showers alot more often and didn't realize how bad it was. I imagine her habits\
  \ are due to how she was raised, so I just needed to show her its not the best.\
  \ I'll update as to how it goes when I know :)"
