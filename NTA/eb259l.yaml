selftext: "I'll try to keep this short and sweet.  \n\nWhen my boyfriend and I got\
  \ engaged, we shared the news with my parents via a Skype call.  After the initial\
  \ excitement, my mom said, \"Just so you know, your dad and I will BOTH be walking\
  \ you down the aisle because we BOTH raised you.\"  I  didn't rebuttal in the moment,\
  \ but I'm pretty bothered by the idea for a few reasons:\n\n1.)  I was looking forward\
  \ to that special moment with just my dad.  I feel like my dad being a great guy\
  \ is a huge reason why I'm marrying a great guy, and that symbolism of him giving\
  \ me away has a lot of meaning for me.  I'm tearing up right now just thinking of\
  \ it.  \n\n2.)  Logistically, the bride typically has one arm linked with their\
  \ dad, and the other holding a bouquet of flowers.  In a scenario with my mom added,\
  \ I am linking both my arms with them and have no flowers?  Or I awkwardly try to\
  \ hold flowers at the same time as having both arms linked?  Or no touching at all\
  \ and I just hold flowers?  \n\n3.) I didn't like that my mom just TOLD me she was\
  \ doing this, and did not ask.  \n\nOne more tidbit of importance.... I've had a\
  \ rocky relationship with my mom over the years, and been through therapy to get\
  \ some understanding of why.  In short, she was very critical and controlling when\
  \ I was growing up, which has led to me being rather self-critical and people pleasing\
  \ in my adult life.   I know my mom had a really tough childhood and had to grow\
  \ up very fast, so I don't blame her for being this way, she is just human. \n\n\
  So, WBITA if I offer a new idea of my brother walking her down the aisle instead?\
  \  Or am I making a mountain out of a mole hill and should just let it go?\n\nEDIT:\
  \  Some people are under the impression that my mom is still as controlling and\
  \ critical as she was when I was growing up. She has loosened up a lot since I moved\
  \ out long ago, and is generally very kind to me.  \n\nAlso, we are already having\
  \ a pretty non-traditional wedding as it is (non religious, writing our own vows,\
  \ no garter or bouquet toss) so I don\u2019t really have the excuse of tradition.\
  \ \n\nI told my fianc\xE9 about this post, and he had a really good point after\
  \ reading the comments. He said I\u2019ll get to have the dad daughter dance with\
  \ just my dad, so the aisle walk isn\u2019t the only moment with my dad. And her\
  \ desire to walk with me probably comes from a place of love, I\u2019m just wired\
  \ to assume it\u2019s control based on everything from growing up.  She\u2019s been\
  \ very thoughtful about her other requests, and respectful when I\u2019ve said no\
  \ to some other things. \n\nThank you all for your replies. Honestly, with how much\
  \ people were assuming my mom was awful, it made me realize she really isn\u2019\
  t the person she was anymore and walking down the aisle with me might be the olive\
  \ branch we all need.  This was cathartic, thank you all so much."
title: WIBTA if I told my mom that I don't want her walking me down the aisle at my
  upcoming wedding?
