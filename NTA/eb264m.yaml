selftext: 'I''m not a terrible spender, but I''ve recently realized that I could be
  a lot better with my spending. I still owe 12k in student loans and I want to pay
  them off by Jan 1, 2021. To do this, I need to start making some radical changes
  in my home. All the extra money saved will go towards my student loans.


  1. I''m switching from bulk buying as Sam''s Club and getting name brand items to
  getting dollar store items and cancelling my Sam''s Club membership. I bulk bought
  things like laundry detergent and toilet paper for both of us thinking I was saving
  money, but I''ve done the math and I''m not. I told my roommate she can still use
  my house hold stuff, but it will no longer be name brand.

  2. Cancelling my amazon prime. I impulse buy way to much and toiletries are to expensive
  there compared to the dollar store. You can get free shipping for $25, so if I need
  something cheap I''ll just need to wait and buy it until I have $25 worth of stuff,
  cutting my impulse buying of little stupid things. My roommate was using my amazon
  prime and I told her she''ll just have to get her own.

  3. Going with more vegetarian meals. I like to cook, my roommate does not. On days
  I don''t cook, she often gets take out. I eat meat and like meat but it''s just
  to expensive and to expensive to continue to cook for two people. I told her she
  could have some of my vegetarian meals, but meat will be very seldom and I will
  not be providing extra portions of meat meals to her for free anymore. If she wants
  me to cook meat, she''s welcome to buy it and I''ll make it if I feel like cooking.


  I think this will allow me to save about $300 a month and allow me to pay off my
  debt about four months sooner that I would if I kept us these spending habits.


  The combination of the demotion of name brand stuff, to the meatless meals, to the
  loss of the free amazon prime has caused my roommate Sarah, 26f, to basically lose
  her shit. She screamed at me and told me I "owe her" these things. I own the home,
  Sarah rents a room. Sarah seems to think it was part of her rental agreement I provide
  these things to her, it does not mention these things in our contract. It only says
  she gets a bedroom, access to the shared bathroom, and access to the common household
  areas. Nowhere do I promise to provide cooked meals with meat, amazon prime, or
  name brand cleaning supplies. I was just being a good roommate or so I thought.
  I''m now tempted to not allow Sarah to use any of my things because of her shitty
  attitude and the fact it would save me another $100 a month at least. I really don''t
  want to cook for her either because i''ll be cooking at home more and it will mean
  extra work cooking for her every night. I know Sarah struggles financially (I occasionally
  allow her to pay the rent a few days late without penalty because I know she hasn''t
  gotten paid yet) and that''s why I was helping her but I''m now I''m willing to
  say fuck it. WIBTA?'
title: AITA for telling my roommate/tenant I am going to be cutting costs in 2020
  and she needs to either accept it or buy her own stuff?
