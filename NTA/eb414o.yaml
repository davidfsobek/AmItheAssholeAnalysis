selftext: "Recently me and my gf have been having some problems in our relationship\
  \ and it all has to do with the way she dresses around the house and it has gotten\
  \ too much for me to handle and it all came crashing down last night.\n\nSome background\
  \ on the issue: my gf likes to stay in her bra and panties around the house which\
  \ i had no issues with at first until she started doing it when my friends or her\
  \ friends were around and it makes me super uncomfortable.\n\nI have spoken to her\
  \ many times but all she says is that it's her body and that she'll dress the way\
  \ she wants and that i need to be more comfortable and need to stop being jealous\
  \ which isn't the point. I mean, would you guys be OK with your SO being the only\
  \ one wearing a bra and pantie in front of your male friends?\n\nNow to last night:\
  \ I was hosting dinner which included me, my gf, my parents and younger brother.\
  \ Everything was going perfect until my gf decided it was too hot and changed into\
  \ a sports bra and underwear and I fucking lost it.\n\nMy Dad had to intervene and\
  \ asked my gf to dress like a proper woman, I lost it when she told my dad very\
  \ rudely that she will dress how ever the fuck she wants in her own house and I\
  \ fucking snapped.\n\nFirst of all it's my fucking house where she only pays her\
  \ own cell bill and that's it.\n\nI told her to pack her shit and to leave my house\
  \ right away and that she was no longer welcomed here which confused her at first\
  \ but she soon realized that i wasn't fucking around. Felt really bad for my rents\
  \ and brother, my parents apologized to me profusely especially my dad. He is blaming\
  \ himself for what happened, he told me that he shouldn't have said anything and\
  \ that he is sorry for messing with my relationship which I don't blame him one\
  \ bit.\n\nAs for the gf, got a lot of missed calls and messages not only from her\
  \ but her friends and her mom too. I'm being blamed for not sticking up to my girlfriend\
  \ and that according to her mom i'm not man enough to handle her daughter. Whatever\
  \ the fuck that means and of course i'm being called an assbole by pretty much everyone\
  \ from her end, even few of my woman friends agree with her.\n\n I loved her, gave\
  \ her everything and spoiled the heck out of her which is my own fault.\n\nI'm lost\
  \ tbh, don't know if i really did the right thing but i'm more bummed about my Dad.\n\
  \nEdit: grammar"
title: AITA for kicking my gf of 6 years out of my house last night because of her
  behavior which resulted in my parents and younger brother being very uncomfortable
  and the night ended up with them leaving the dinner early?
