selftext: "Little backstory: I, (M21), have a huge family, besides my dad, uncles,\
  \ and cousins husbands I\u2019m the only guy in my family. We are a loud bunch and\
  \ I see them a lot and I love every stinking one of them. A few years back one of\
  \ my cousins said that since we have such a big family we should do a secret Santa\
  \ thing, where we all pull names from a hat and whoever you get you get to give\
  \ them a gift under 100 bucks. Great idea very affordable. (Excluding children of\
  \ course, anyone under the age of 15 gets a gift like regular from everyone). \n\
  \        Recently we were all hanging out at my cousins house, (who is pregnant\
  \ with her second child due in MAY, and her other baby will be one years old on\
  \ the 27th), and the topic of secret Santa came up. We were all talking about secret\
  \ Santa and if people got their gifts yet, and I said, \u201Cyeah I got mine, now\
  \ all I have to get is the kids something then I\u2019m good\u201D.  \n        \
  \  My pregnant cousin and my aunt said, \u201Cwhat did you get the kids?\u201D (They\
  \ weren\u2019t in the room at the time so I could tell the adults what I got them).\
  \ Then I told them all what I could my four nieces and one nephew for Christmas.\
  \ My cousin responded, \u201Caren\u2019t you forgetting someone?\u201D I honestly\
  \ couldn\u2019t think about who I was forgetting so I said, \n             \u201C\
  no haha\u201D. \nShe then said, \u201Cwhat about baby number two?\u201D (Pointing\
  \ to her stomach, because she doesn\u2019t have a name yet). \n     Me who thought\
  \ she was joking said, \u201Coh yeah duh how could I forget!\u201D (With an obvious\
  \ joking tone in my voice)\u201D  The room went from everyone talking over each\
  \ other and laughs to dead silence, and was like wtf happened. She then looked me\
  \ dead in the eye and asked if I was really not getting the baby something, and\
  \ I said, \u201Cumm no why would I? The baby isn\u2019t even born yet.\u201D She\
  \ and my aunt and other cousins all jumped on my case and freaked out, and after\
  \ 20 minutes of arguing my case I just left and told them I would see them at Christmas.\
  \ \n         So am I the asshole for not getting my cousins second baby, who is\
  \ DUE IN MAY a Christmas gift??\n\n       TLDR: Was talking to family about secret\
  \ Santa and gifts and what not and my pregnant cousin asked if I got her baby a\
  \ gift who is due in May. I said no and chaos insued."
