selftext: "Background: I have 2 children that my partner and I adopted out of foster\
  \ care. My partner and I are both white, and our kids are clearly mixed race. The\
  \ kids know that they are adopted from foster care, but we don\u2019t openly share\
  \ that with people because our oldest is insecure about being our \u201Creal\u201D\
  \ son still. When I say we don\u2019t openly share, I mean we don\u2019t volunteer\
  \ the info unless someone asks, and we generally assume that people can figure it\
  \ out on their own.\n\nI started volunteering for my kids\u2019 school events and\
  \ quickly got absorbed into the group of parent volunteers. We had a group text\
  \ to discuss the events we were planning as well as some dinners and such we had\
  \ together.\n\nMy entire family came to a fundraiser and it was the first time my\
  \ partner had met all the other volunteers. I thought it seemed fine. I did notice\
  \ more than one person asking how long we\u2019d been married and how old our kids\
  \ are, but those seemed more or less innocuous. Afterwards, I got a text from one\
  \ of the fathers that was clearly meant to be sent to another group text. It said\
  \ \u201Cwe can all agree that [my] kids aren\u2019t her husbands right? Do you think\
  \ he\u2019s just ignoring that they\u2019re black?\u201D\n\nI found it incredibly\
  \ rude that they were gossiping about me like that, so I responded \u201Cjeez I\
  \ certainly hope they aren\u2019t his biological kids.\u201D I didn\u2019t include\
  \ any other context. I was angry and kind of just wanted to make them aware that\
  \ I could see what they were saying. It kicked up quite a shitstorm though. No one\
  \ texted back in the group message, but multiple people sent screenshots of the\
  \ message to my partner. He ended up being the one to say the kids were adopted,\
  \ and I do feel bad that I put that burden on him by not clarifying. He says he\
  \ didn\u2019t mind though.\n\nThe president of the PTA however basically kicked\
  \ me out of the volunteering positions I held. He said I intentionally caused chaos\
  \ by acting immaturely. Frankly I didn\u2019t really want to work with those people\
  \ anymore anyway, but I do feel guilty for not being more mature about it and lashing\
  \ out in anger. Am I an asshole for being vague and not just explaining the situation\
  \ to the people that were gossiping about me?"

  sent me a text gossiping about my family
