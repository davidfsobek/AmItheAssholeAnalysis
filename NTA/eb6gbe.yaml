selftext: "My brother is 13 and he has autism\u2014high functioning. \n\n\nI\u2019\
  m 17(also a guy). He only comes to my dad\u2019s house(where I live) 3 times a week\
  \ during the school year. Every time he\u2019s here, he takes a shower and doesn\u2019\
  t bring his clothes in the bathroom so he walks out naked. \n\n\nHe\u2019s going\
  \ through puberty and I don\u2019t want to see my 13 year old brothers pubes and\
  \ balls. At first I was casual about it and just said \u201Cdude start taking your\
  \ boxers in the bathroom or wrap a town around ya\u201D. He just said \u201Cuhhh\
  \ ok\u201D but proceeded to keep coming out of the bathroom naked. The next time\
  \ I said something like \u201Cwoah dude, grab a towel. You don\u2019t see me and\
  \ dad walking around naked\u201D\n\n\n\nBut he kept doing it so finally I said \u201C\
  Josh, you are 13. You need to put clothes on when walking around the house. It\u2019\
  s gross and you\u2019re too old for that.\u201D\n\n\nHe started crying and told\
  \ my dad that I think he\u2019s gross. My dad wasn\u2019t that mad and told me to\
  \ apologize but he did have a talk with him about what\u2019s appropriate as far\
  \ as nudity goes.\n\n\n\nJosh also told his mom what I said when he went back there\
  \ on Friday and she got really mad and sent my dad a bunch of texts about it. She\
  \ said I have no right to make him feel uncomfortable about his body and that\u2019\
  s really harmful to a kids self esteem"
