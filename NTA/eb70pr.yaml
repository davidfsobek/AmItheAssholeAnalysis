selftext: "\n\nSo over the past few years the candy cane lane in our town has gotten\
  \ insanely popular with people from out of town because people have been posting\
  \ all about it on social media. All of us have really elaborate decorations.\n\n\
  This has caused the street to be so crowded and full of people for weeks leading\
  \ up to Christmas that the residents cannot leave out of their driveways anymore.\
  \ \n\nSo I talked over the issue with our neighbors and all of us have agreed to\
  \ keep all our Christmas lights off except on Saturday nights, Christmas and Christmas\
  \ Eve.\n\nOn Friday night when my wife and I got home there were groups of people\
  \ walking towards our street and few families milling about the street.\n\nOne of\
  \ the dads came up to me and asked if this was candy cane lane and why all the lights\
  \ were off. I told him it was and why the lights were off.\n\nHe asked pretty politely\
  \ if we could turn on our lights because they wouldn\u2019t be able to come next\
  \ day or next weekend as this was the day that worked for everyone. He also said\
  \ they had come from downtown of major city nearby (which is a pretty big drive)\
  \ because their kids don\u2019t get to see lights otherwise. Downtown area can be\
  \ really shady at night and the city pretty much just puts on a few string of lights\
  \ here and there.\n\nI knew my other neighbors would be mad at me if I caved.  I\
  \ was a big advocate for keeping the lights off except on certain nights at our\
  \ block meeting. I also really doubt no one would notice because the street was\
  \ practically all dark except for the lights in people\u2019s windows. Plus with\
  \ more people coming I knew it would be more trouble if I tried to turn them off.\
  \ So I said  \u201Cno, I\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t\u201D \n\nNow it\u2019s Sunday\
  \ and my wife found a post online about our street with people in the comments saying\
  \ how upset they were that the lights aren\u2019t up every night and that it\u2019\
  s really unfortunate for all the people who can\u2019t come on those nights. That\
  \ it was really good for the community and our neighboring communities. Some even\
  \ brought up how they asked some of the residents to turn on their lights for a\
  \ few minutes and the replies to those comments were less than kind towards the\
  \ residents.\n\nUpdate: After those posts got a lot of attention. one of my neighbors\
  \ brought up maybe advertising that it\u2019s just going to be on random nights\
  \ (only known to the residents) from now on. That way at least the people will know\
  \ it\u2019s not a guaranteed thing and not come in droves and we get to enjoy our\
  \ lights more often. Hopefully we can get everyone to agree to that for next year."
title: AITA for not turning on my Christmas lights for some families that came to
  see them because everyone on our street agreed to keep them off?
