selftext: "She stopped taking her birth control pills several weeks ago and did not\
  \ tell me. She claims to have \u201Cforgotten\u201D to tell me, but that seems like\
  \ a pretty big thing to forget. To be 100% clear; I don\u2019t care if she is on\
  \ the pill or not. However, I DO NOT want children, and she is well aware of this\
  \ and has said herself many time she doesn\u2019t want kids. When she first went\
  \ on the pill I told her if she needs to come off it at anytime that\u2019s ok but\
  \ she needs to tell me. Not that she needs my permission but she simply needs to\
  \ keep me in the loop. I understand it\u2019s her body but this directly effects\
  \ OUR sex/reproductive life.\n\nAnyway, when I found out I flew off the handle.\
  \ She continued to act like it wasn\u2019t a big deal, and I kept trying to explain\
  \ that when she makes a choice like that if has as much of an impact on me as it\
  \ does her. Then she tried to apologize.\n\nThis is when I\u2019d normally calm\
  \ down and be rational however she continued to say \u201Csorry\u2026 but.\u201D\
  \ Where I come from if you are actually sorry you don\u2019t add a \u201Cbut\u201D\
  \ \u201Chowever\u201D \u201Cif\u201D \u201Cexcept\u201D or anything of the sort.\
  \ If you are sorry you are sorry. You don\u2019t try to explain your way out of\
  \ it. IDK\u2026 it really pissed me off and I stormed out of the house and took\
  \ a long drive to cool off. From my POV I see it as lying to me about our sexual\
  \ health followed by an insincere apology.\n\nAm I the asshole?"
