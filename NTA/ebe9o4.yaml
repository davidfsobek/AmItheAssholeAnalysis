selftext: "I graduated from med school. It\u2019s been rough. You\u2019d think my\
  \ older sister (DD) who dropped out of law school due to stress would be sympathetic,\
  \ but she\u2019s been a debbie downer, always saying things like, \u201CIf it\u2019\
  s so hard then just quit.\u201D Since I started my residency she keeps saying things\
  \ like, \u201CDon\u2019t kill anyone.\u201D This has been my dream job since I was\
  \ a kid though, and I\u2019m loving it.\n\nDD is a mom of 3 and often asks me to\
  \ babysit or hang out with the kids, but my husband always says that she\u2019s\
  \ just using me to help take care of them. I usually don\u2019t mind but lately\
  \ I\u2019ve just been so tired from work. \n\nEarlier this week she invited me to\
  \ her son\u2019s BD party at a skating rink, scheduled for the weekend. It\u2019\
  s not his BD yet but she wanted to celebrate early. I told her I wasn\u2019t sure\
  \ if I could make it since I\u2019d be working the night before and I\u2019m always\
  \ super tired after. I\u2019d also already promised my grandparents I\u2019d come\
  \ to their dinner party that night, so I\u2019d be running on no sleep. But DD begged\
  \ me to come so I figured I\u2019d go and catch up on sleep after.\n\nThat night\
  \ shift was rough, though. I was too tired to drive home so I called my husband\
  \ to come pick me up. I then decided to take a nap before my nephew\u2019s party.\
  \ Big mistake. I didn\u2019t wake up until late afternoon and had a ton of missed\
  \ calls from DD. I called to apologize but she wasn\u2019t having any of it.\n\n\
  I felt really bad. Since my car was at the hospital and my husband was at work,\
  \ I called my mom to see if I could catch a ride to the skating rink with her on\
  \ the off chance that she hadn\u2019t left yet. (She\u2019s notorious for being\
  \ late.) My mom said this was the first she was hearing about this party. Turns\
  \ out DD hadn\u2019t invited anyone else in the family. And after seeing a few photos\
  \ on Facebook, turns out it was meant to be a kids party for my nephew and his schoolmates.\
  \ My mom asked if I still needed a ride. I said no, figuring I\u2019d see my nephew\
  \ at my grandparents\u2019 house later that night and give him his gift then. But\
  \ when I got to my grandparents\u2019, I learned that they hadn\u2019t invited DD.\
  \ Awkward.\n\nDD texted me later, basically accusing me of putting my career over\
  \ my family, saying that I need to learn to manage my time for the sake of my future\
  \ kids. I responded by saying that since I don\u2019t have kids right now I\u2019\
  m going keep on living as if I don\u2019t, and that I\u2019ll worry about that when\
  \ I get there. She replied, once again saying that she hopes I don\u2019t kill anyone.\
  \ I told her that she needs to stop projecting onto me since it\u2019s not my fault\
  \ she never made it out of law school, and that she can forget about me babysitting\
  \ her kids from now on.\n\nDD is now refusing to come to any of the family holiday\
  \ parties unless I apologize to her in front of everyone. I feel bad for putting\
  \ my family in an awkward position and for depriving my nephew and nieces of the\
  \ holiday festivities. But I\u2019m tired of my sister always talking down on me.\
  \ AITA?"
