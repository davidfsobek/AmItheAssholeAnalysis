selftext: "\nSo my husband and I moved to New York from London about a month ago and\
  \ a lot of people expressed an interest in visiting while I was out there. My cousin,\
  \ whom I\u2019m very close to, just finished a visit, she stayed with us on a pullout\
  \ couch in our living room. \n\nInitially, it was going to be just her visiting.\
  \ On my leaving do (party), she asked if she could also bring her boyfriend; he\
  \ had taken issue with the fact she hadn\u2019t invited him. He actually didn\u2019\
  t come to the leaving do, although he did send me a nice text. She said he would\
  \ mostly want to go to art galleries so he wouldn\u2019t affect our time together\
  \ and so on, I said yes and all seemed well. \n\nThe way I thought this week would\
  \ go, would be the three of us sitting down each day (or whenever) and deciding\
  \ what we wanted to do (my husband would be working). In actual fact, they came\
  \ with a huge list of things to do, and were mapping out their wants without ever\
  \ asking me what I would like to do, or actually asking me to join. On a few days\
  \ where I tagged along I was completely the third wheel, they would either bicker\
  \ or show PDA. On a particularly cold walk I asked to stop for a coffee and was\
  \ told no \u201Clet\u2019s keep going\u201D I suggested again when I saw a very\
  \ sweet coffee shop in the west village and again, no. \n\nIt began on the evening\
  \ of the first day, they cancelled our dinner plans to go to a comedy show. I was\
  \ miffed. I asked them to message me what they had planned because we had booked\
  \ a few tables and I\u2019d need to know whether to cancel them. I got a response\
  \ along the lines of \u201Cwe\u2019re going to the comedy cellar tonight and brunch\
  \ together tomorrow and then doing to get 2 tickets to see a show. We need to plan\
  \ in an evening for our romantic meal so we may have to cancel one of those bookings\u201D\
  \ each explicitly worded to say \u201Cjust us\u201D. This was only day 1 and I\u2019\
  d left them to their own thing in the afternoon so I doubt I\u2019d really suffocated\
  \ them. \n\nAfter that, I leaned back. Each day they made their plans and it was\
  \ \u201Ccome if you want\u201D. I rarely saw them or knew what their plans were.\
  \ One night I messaged them that we would be heading to bed at 10, my husband has\
  \ work in the morning, and they came home at gone 11, needing to be let in. \n\n\
  So anyway, I felt like I was being used for my apartment and that if they had wanted\
  \ a holiday to spend lots of time just the two of them that they should just book\
  \ a hotel. To be clear, I don\u2019t expect them to spend all their time with me,\
  \ but when you visit someone you should make plans to spend time with them. \n\n\
  When my cousin was leaving they were talking to us about coming back in the summer.\
  \ I recommended an app for checking flights and said I could help them find a hotel\
  \ in a good area. Flash forward 2 days and I\u2019ve had a call from my mum trying\
  \ to understand what happened because she\u2019s telling our family that was I very\
  \ rude to them...\n\nAITA?"
