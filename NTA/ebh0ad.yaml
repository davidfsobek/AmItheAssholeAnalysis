selftext: "So yesterday I picked my daughter up from her father's house and she informs\
  \ me that her father has planned a ski trip during break and wants her to go. This\
  \ is the first I've heard of this and we already have plans that were set up months\
  \ ago. \n\nWe have a standing custody arrangement with the courts that outlines\
  \ which parent she is with for which holidays, things are far from cordial between\
  \ me and her father. This year i have her for Christmas break, although he does\
  \ get her from noon Christmas day to 6pm on the 26th. As me and my husband still\
  \ have to work the 26th and 27th and our plans aren't until the 28th I was planning\
  \ on allowing her to stay a couple extra days so that she could spend time with\
  \ her sisters on her father's side. I am usually fairly lenient with rearranging\
  \ the visitation schedule so long as I am given enough notice and we don't already\
  \ have plans. \n\nMy husband thinks I have been far to nice and that i need to put\
  \ my foot down (this is not the first time her father has done something like this)\
  \ We keep a copy of both visitation schedules (we also have custody of his 2 boys\
  \ from his first marriage) taped to the fridge and always check before making plans\
  \ so as to not inconvenience others. He thinks its very inconsiderate of my ex to\
  \ make plans without checking the schedule and then expect us to change our plans\
  \ last minute. \n\nSo WIBTA if I tell her father no?\n\nEDIT: So little more info...\n\
  \nWe have plans Christmas eve, Christmas morning, and from the 28th until the 1st.\
  \ We are planning to visit family 8 hours away that we only see every couple years.\
  \ This has been planned since August and my husband and I have already taken off\
  \ work those dates. My daughter was very excited about visiting her cousins up until\
  \ her father dangled this particular carrot and this is not the first time he has\
  \ done this. He did a similar thing last year when we had a week long trip to Niagara\
  \ Falls \n\nFather planned trip for the 26th to the 1st, has the same copy of the\
  \ schedule as I do, and has not mentioned a single thing to me about this\n\nIf\
  \ he had approached me about this sooner I would be willing to do what I can to\
  \ make it work, but its ten days away and i still have not heard from him, he left\
  \ that to my daughter\n\nI feel as if he is manipulating her for his own benefit\
  \ and I get the shit end of the stick no matter what. If I let her go, I have to\
  \ change our plans and disrupt our schedule, not to mention her cousins are gonna\
  \ be heartbroken if she doesn't come, they adore her. It also sets a bad precedent\
  \ with father because it shows him that he can continue to be selfish and inconsiderate\
  \ with no consequences. But if I don't let her go, she's going to be pissed off\
  \ at me, which I'm sure will absolutely delight her father\n\nEDIT 2\n\nSo I have\
  \ been seeing a lot of comments about letting her choose, and generally thats what\
  \ I do. Unless we have something special planned or something that involves her\
  \ directly, I am usually able to shuffle things around a bit, even if that involves\
  \ me missing out on things. But when you have 3 children (11,14,15) and have to\
  \ worry about visitation, school, sports, church groups, and a whole slew of other\
  \ things to worry about, including her weekly therapy appointments, thats a whole\
  \ other discussion, planning and schedules become extremely important. We have a\
  \ large family that is spread all over the east coast so get togethers are tough,\
  \ but even so, we are all very close, including the children. We talk and video\
  \ chat regularly and very much cherish what time we do get to have together. That\
  \ being said, this is not the first time that her father has infringed on our plans\
  \ last minute. I feel like if I keep allowing this, I will continue to be taken\
  \ advantage of. I really don't mind doing what I can, because I know it's what's\
  \ best for my daughter, but this time he should rearrange shit, since he was the\
  \ one who didn't plan and didn't notify me"
