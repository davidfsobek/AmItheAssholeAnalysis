  \nI'm 17 and my stepbrother is 17. We both have our driving license.\n\nI just found\
  \ out 5 days ago that my dad and stepmom bought a used car for my stepbrother. They\
  \ got me a 600 dollar gift card to best buy. \n\nI know $600 is a lot of money but\
  \ what the fuck? Am I crazy or is it super unfair? It's literally the straw that\
  \ broke the goddamn camel's back.\n\nI'm actually so pissed off that I've moved\
  \ to my mom's house full time.\n\nMy dad seems to be genuinely sorry and told me\
  \ he's looking for a car now but that it'll take a while.\n\nI messaged him back\
  \ saying that I'll decide if I want to see him after he decides to be fair for once.\
  \ I've ignored all other calls and messages from him since.\n\nMy stepbrother messaged\
  \ me saying that I need to chill out and that he'll let me use his car. He also\
  \ said that I need to stop bitching and ruining everyone's Christmas. I told him\
  \ to get in his civic and fuck off.\n\nAITA?"
