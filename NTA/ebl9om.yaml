selftext: 'I''m hosting extended family Christmas this year. I''m not very happy about
  it, as this will be the 3rd time I''ve hosted Christmas in 5 years, when there are
  meant to be 4 households rotating turns. Husband and kids say they don''t mind and
  are helping me out but it gets exhausting sorting everything out.


  My family are arriving on the 22nd and staying until the 2nd.


  My husband and I have 4 bedrooms and 2 kids.


  * Room 1 is our bedroom, which we''d hoped to keep

  * Room 2 is normally our younger son''s room, but we are putting all of the kids
  under 10 (our younger son (8) and my sister''s 2 kids (8f and 5m)) in that room
  with a combination of bunk beds and a sleeping bag.

  * Room 3 is normally our older son''s (age 12) room, but the (double) bed will be
  given to my sister and her husband, as they are a married couple.

  * Room 4 is the guest room (also double bed) and it''s been designated for my brother
  and his fiancee.

  * This leaves a sofa in the office that opens out into a double bed, which I am
  planning to give to my mother, as she and dad are long divorced and it''s just her.

  * There is also a couch in the front room, but my older son said he would give up
  his room if he got the living room couch, because he wanted the smart TV.


  My mum asked about sleeping arrangements in the group chat, and I said there''s
  a kids room, a room for sis + husband, a room for bro + fiancee, and sofa bed for
  mum.


  Mum then starts making a fuss saying that she wants a "proper" bed and the sofa
  bed hurts her back. I reply that my logic was that there were 3 couples, 3 under
  10s, and 2 people who had no reason to be sharing a room with anyone. I told them
  we have a room divider we can put in the office so she can have more privacy and
  we won''t use the office while she''s in there, plus my brother/his fiancee leave
  on the 27th so she can have the room after that.


  I go to the shop, I''m out for half an hour, and I come back to about 2 dozen messages
  in the chat, all variations of "u/singledoublebed how could you do this to our mother?"
  or "don''t worry mum you can have my room", which would be fine since the situation
  resolved itself, but then I see a series of messages immediately after that one
  saying "since u/singledoublebed is the reason we''re debating this, shouldn''t mum
  get *her* room?" and replies along the lines of "exactly! she''s the host!"


  I decided to nip this shit in the bud ASAP so I post in the group chat "mine and
  my husband''s bed is not up for consideration here. This is getting too complicated
  and this whole thing is stressful enough already so either stick to what I said
  or see you next year."


  That went down like a lead balloon. Everyone hates me now and husband read it and
  said he''d support me to them but it was a very heavy foot I just put down. If I''m
  in the wrong then I''ll apologise and let them coordinate rooms.


  AITA?


  Info: my mother is in her mid 50s, exercises daily, and has no health problems or
  back problems whatsoever. What so does have is a history of saying things she doesn''t
  want to do physically hurt her. The last time I hosted Christmas I heard: "peeling
  and chopping hurts my elbow" when I asked for help making Christmas dinner, "I''ve
  got a headache" when I suggested she and my husband take the kids to the park, and
  "the noise of the tape hurts my ears" when she asked me to wrap the presents she''d
  brought along. Every one of these was bullshit, so when she said the sofa bed hurts
  her back I am fairly confident that this is another instance of her trying to get
  out of is, especially as the sofa bed is brand new and has never been used by her.'

  Christmas?
