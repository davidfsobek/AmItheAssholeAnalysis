selftext: "With all of the cheating parent stories I\u2019ve seen on this sub lately,\
  \ I thought I\u2019d see what you all think of mine. Growing up, my dad and I were\
  \ extremely close. He taught me everything and was a major influence on my sense\
  \ of right and wrong. I say that to give you an idea as to why it was incredibly\
  \ hard on me when I walked in on him banging the nanny when I was 16. \n\nI told\
  \ my mom which resulted in their divorce the next year. My dad quickly married the\
  \ nanny after he\u2019d gotten her pregnant. They had a daughter around the time\
  \ I graduated from high school.\n\nIn the two years between their affair coming\
  \ to light and me graduating, my relationship with my dad not only went downhill,\
  \ but it basically fell off a cliff. I felt betrayed and I basically told him that\
  \ he was dead to me. I had lost all respect for him. I also didn\u2019t have any\
  \ qualms about showing him and his new wife how little I respected them on the very\
  \ few occasions I actually saw them. It all came to a head when he and his wife\
  \ showed up to my graduation ceremony with their baby. I was livid. I didn\u2019\
  t want him there. I held it together during the ceremony, but at the after-party\
  \ I blew up at him and her. I don\u2019t remember what I said, but he said that\
  \ if I didn\u2019t show him and his wife some respect then he would not be helping\
  \ pay for my college. I told him he could keep his money. I had no intention of\
  \ caving to him no matter what he threatened me with. I never spoke to him again.\n\
  \nEventually, Cassie (full-sister) told me that he had been diagnosed with liver\
  \ cancer and that the prognosis was not good. I told her that I was sorry for her,\
  \ but I would not go see him. It\u2019s probably necessary to say that Cassie would\
  \ spend summers with them and she grew quite close to their daughter. They were\
  \ only two years apart in age. About six months after Cassie told me about the cancer\
  \ she called and said that he was probably not going to make it through the week.\
  \ Again, I told her I was sorry, but I wouldn\u2019t be coming to see him. He died\
  \ the next day. I refused to attend his funeral.\n\nCassie got a small inheritance,\
  \ but I\u2019ve been paying her tuition since it ran out after her first semester.\n\
  \nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019m TA. A few months ago I got a\
  \ really long Facebook message from their daughter. Apparently whatever inheritance\
  \ she and her mother got was already gone and she was wondering if I would be able\
  \ to help her with tuition next year like I do with Cassie. I said no. Her mom called\
  \ me later and left a voicemail begging me to help saying that she knew I could\
  \ because I was already \u201Ceasily paying for Cassie\u2019s tuition\u201D and\
  \ I shouldn\u2019t punish \u201Cmy sister\u201D for what she and my father did almost\
  \ two decades ago. I admit that it would not really hurt me financially to pay her\
  \ tuition, but I really don\u2019t want to because I don\u2019t really view her\
  \ as a sister the way Cassie does. So reddit, AITA?"
