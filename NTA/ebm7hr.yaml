selftext: "Like the title says, I had a facebook friend share a post regarding a litter\
  \ of puppies for sale.  The post said they were Australian Shepherd puppies.  No\
  \ pics of doggie mom or dad, but all 7 of these dogs looked like pit bulls with\
  \ aussie coloring.  I mean, they looked NOTHING like purebred australian shepherds\
  \ (Info: My aunt owns and breeds them and I have been around dozens of pure bred\
  \ pups and adult Aus Shep dogs) and had all the physical characteristics of pit\
  \ bulls (stance, ears, muzzle, fur length, etc...). So I shared the pic with my\
  \ aunt and my uncle (who is not on FB) texted back to me and said you need to tell\
  \ your friend to be honest about those dogs. My uncle is a licensed doctor of veterinary\
  \ medicine and has been for 30+ years.  He told me to please urge my friend to correct\
  \ the post.  So, I posted a reply to her original shared puppy post that simply\
  \ said: \"What breed are these dogs mixed with?\"  and nothing else.  She immediately\
  \ IM'd me cussing me out and asking me to delete my post and stop being an AH. \
  \ I told her what my uncle and aunt told me, and she told me to mind my business.\
  \  \nI didn't post anything else and agreed to drop it.  When I asked my uncle why\
  \ he was so adamant, he informed me that one of his clients lost their dog to this\
  \ type of thing.  She responded to an ad to adopt a \"labrador\", and was told by\
  \ her apartment complex that she could either get evicted or move out or get rid\
  \ of the dog, since it was clearly a pittie, and her lease has restrictions against\
  \ certain breeds.  She showed her landlord (and my uncle) the post and email from\
  \ the seller stating it was a labrador (not restricted) and the landlord made her\
  \ get a doggie DNA test from PetSmart to prove it.  Guess what it came back as?\
  \  So she was forced to either give up her dog or her home, and not being able to\
  \ afford to break a lease, she had to surrender the dog, since the seller wouldn't\
  \ take it back and claimed that the emails never specifically said she guaranteed\
  \ the breed, just that she needed someone to take the dog.  I PM'd my friend this\
  \ story and said, I am sorry you were upset, but look what can happen if you aren't\
  \ truthful, and she hasn't responded at all.    \n\n\nSo....AITA?  I certainly don't\
  \ feel like one, especially now that I know that you can get kicked out of certain\
  \ housing types for having the wrong dog breed (which is ridiculous, IMO).  I also\
  \ had no idea that they sold doggie DNA kits OTC at pet stores.\n\nUPDATE: I tried\
  \ to grab pictures but am now blocked by the content owner (not my friend).  The\
  \ two comments under mine both said the same thing I did. Shame I couldn't grab\
  \ a pic, the puppies were very cute."
title: AITA if I point out the true breed of advertised puppies?
