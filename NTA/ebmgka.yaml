selftext: "A couple weeks ago at my job we all got together because we are closed\
  \ Sundays and all had a Christmas party. We ate and played games and generally had\
  \ a good time. We were surprised to find out we all got Christmas presents. A couple\
  \ months ago, we were told to make a wish list. They called out names and we would\
  \ open our gifts in front of everyone. It turned out to be pricier items. Just to\
  \ name a few, gifts given out included a TV, Xbox, Airpods, video games, and Polaroid\
  \ camera. Keep the camera in mind. \n\n\nSo after 20 or so people, they call me\
  \ up and I'm understandably excited. I open my present and I got hand sanitizer.\
  \ Like the ones from Bath and Body works, the compact ones. I smiled and thanked\
  \ them and sat back down. I continued watching and it was soon over and I went out\
  \ to my car and I was a little upset. I was confused on why my coworker (for examples\
  \ sake) got airpods and I got that, regardless that we are on the same level at\
  \ work. I had asked on my list for a Polaroid camera, and they gifted 3 other people\
  \ the camera. I don't understand why I got the short end of the stick. \n\n\nTo\
  \ me, it doesn't even matter about the gift. The principle of it matters. I explained\
  \ this to one of my coworkers that got gifted one of the more pricey items and they\
  \ said I need to stop complaining and get over it because it was just meant as a\
  \ nice gesture. I understand this but again, their should had been a price range.\
  \ I feel terrible for not appreciating my gift but at the same time, I'm irritated.\
  \ \n\nAITA?"
