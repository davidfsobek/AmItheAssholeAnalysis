selftext: "So back story first. I grew up extremely poor and through the years I worked\
  \ very hard, struggled into better jobs and so on and these days I make a good bit\
  \ of money. I feel I\u2019ve done well teaching my kids lessons I learned the hard\
  \ way or wish I had known growing up.  But on very VERY rare occasions I buy my\
  \ kids things I would never of gotten growing up. So I recently bought my oldest\
  \ son a brand new Jeep Wrangler. Well I\u2019ll be damned if the first thing he\
  \ said was \u201CDad I didn\u2019t want a Jeep, I didn\u2019t ask for it either,\
  \ I said I wanted a truck like a thousand times\u201D so today I went right back\
  \ to the dealership with it. Got on Craigslist and bought a 2008 Honda Accord for\
  \ $1000. It\u2019s a great car for the price. BUT my wife tells when I came home\
  \ with it today\u201Cwhy would you do that to him, he\u2019s crushed\u201D and at\
  \ this point I feel it\u2019s what he deserves for being ungrateful, because I didn\u2019\
  t raise him to be that way. In this case I think a hard lesson learned is better\
  \ than pandering to him. My wife thinks otherwise and that he deserves a nice car.\n\
  \n\nUPDATE: So for everyone offering advice and wanting to know if I talked with\
  \ my son. So after I got home from work we took a walk around our property and first\
  \ I apologize for jumping the gun the way I did and for being angry with him. I\
  \ explained why I didn\u2019t get him a big truck and why I went with a Jeep. And\
  \ told him that he\u2019d be keeping the Accord until he can buy his own car. He\
  \ understood and also apologized for his reaction and told me he had his hopes up\
  \ for a truck and was just disappointed, and like some people said he felt like\
  \ I didn\u2019t hear him. He said he did have a problem with keeping the Accord\
  \ since he like having his own car and asked if he could at least have a Bluetooth\
  \ receiver put in (which he will be paying for) As for my wife, she did give me\
  \ a little crap about the whole situation but also said it was good that I apologized\
  \ for being unreasonable."
