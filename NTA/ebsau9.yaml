selftext: "So I (26F) saw my friends (27M and 25F) at the mall with their ~1 year\
  \ old baby. We ended up hanging out, and I offered them a ride home when they mentioned\
  \ needing to catch the bus. When we got to my car, they asked if they could change\
  \ their baby in the car. \n\n\nI asked them if they needed to go back to the mall,\
  \ and we could go to the bathroom. The BF said he didnt feel comfortable changing\
  \ the baby in the bathroom, but wouldnt specify why. I told them I was sorry, but\
  \ my car is really small and I don't think there would be room to lay the baby down.\
  \ Then I told GF I could help her if she wanted. That's when she said that she didn't\
  \ trust public bathrooms to be \"safe from prying eyes\" and I pointed out that\
  \ a parking lot would not be any more private and that I knew where the family bathroom\
  \ stalls were. Then BF says, \"Well we dont know what people have done in there\"\
  \ and I said it's probably cleaned more often than my car (every day vs every other\
  \ week). They huffed and thanked me for \"making their baby sit in his own filth\"\
  \ and making them catch the next bus  then they walked away. Now I feel bad that\
  \ I may have been insensitive to them as new parents. I know the GF has anxiety\
  \ problems and I feel like reaching out to them to apologize. But I also feel like\
  \ it was a weird thing to push when I said no? I sorta feel like an asshole because\
  \ I didnt want to possibly get my own car dirty. \n\n\n\nSo AITA?"
