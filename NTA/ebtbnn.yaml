selftext: "I look very similar to an actor and I live in New York City. \n\nEvery\
  \ so often a tourist would stop me and say \u201Coh my gosh you\u2019re that guy!\u201D\
  \ And I used to interrupt them and say \u201Cno I\u2019m really not.\u201D\n\nBut\
  \ then this guy started starring in a TV show so became way more recognizable. It\
  \ started so I was being stopped 3-5 times a day by people. \n\nOnce I was in a\
  \ mad rush and on the phone so when someone said \u201CAaahhhh you\u2019re that\
  \ guy can I take a selfie\u201D I just smiled for the selfie and said have a great\
  \ day. \n\nIt was faster than explaining and insisting I\u2019m not the guy while\
  \ they accuse me of being too big for the fans, it was kind of funny to think of\
  \ a picture of me floating around as a celebrity, and it was kind of nice to see\
  \ how happy they looked when they thought they\u2019d met this guy even for ten\
  \ seconds. \n\nSo now when people stop me I just take picture or shake their hand\
  \ and move on. I thought it was just funny and never really thought much beyond\
  \ that. \n\nBut I was on a date the other night and the girl said \u201Chey has\
  \ anyone ever told you you look like that guy from that show\u201D and I told her\
  \ this story and she was horrified. \n\nShe said it was so mean to mislead people\
  \ that way. That hadn\u2019t occurred to me and I really don\u2019t want to be a\
  \ dick to people, I thought it was something they\u2019d eventually look back on\
  \ and laugh too. Didn\u2019t occur to me it would be so upsetting. \n\nSo is she\
  \ being oversensitive or am I being an asshole to tourists?"
