selftext: "Her alarm goes off and she repeatedly hits snooze for 60-90 minutes every\
  \ morning. We live together. We are basically on the same sleep schedule, which\
  \ is fine, but I\u2019m tired of losing sleep because of her bad habit. *Maybe*\
  \ 30 minutes maximum would be reasonable for me, but it\u2019s literally at least\
  \ an hour every day with the alarm going off 5-10 times. I\u2019ve talked to her\
  \ about it, and it doesn\u2019t change."
