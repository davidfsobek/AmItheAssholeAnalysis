selftext: "I am in my second to last year of high school and last year I found out\
  \ that my dad was cheating on my mom with an employee of his. I told my mom because\
  \ I knew my dad would never own up himself, and they got divorced. During the divorce,\
  \ my mom was having a hard time coping and turned to drugs, and she got found out,\
  \ now my dad has custody and I only have visits with her. \n\nIt's all been really\
  \ hard on me, and on my mom, and I resent my dad and how everything seemed to work\
  \ out for him. He's married his employee and she's pregnant and living with us.\n\
  \nAnyway, I've been polite to her because I don't want to screw myself over and\
  \ make my dad too angry to pay for college. But it's the kind of \"nice\" I put\
  \ on at my customer service job, a smile and pleasantness, but not actually getting\
  \ to know her personally. It's hard for me to even do that, it's like a lot of emotional\
  \ labor that I don't want to be doing in addition to school and work.\n\nLike for\
  \ example, the kinds of stuff I'll say...\n\nIf she asks me about school, I'll be\
  \ like \"It was nice, we had a nice lecture on genes in class\" or she asks me about\
  \ my teachers and I'll be like \"they're nice, they all seem very smart\" or she'll\
  \ ask me about a movie I saw and I'd be like \"It was good and funny\" \n\nJust\
  \ like trying to be positive and polite. But last week, she lost it at me and was\
  \ like \"Why is everything NICE with you? How's school? NICE. How's work? NICE.\
  \ Your father says you hate your science teacher, but all you ever say to me is\
  \ that everything's NICE like a broken record\" and I was like \"sorry. I really\
  \ do mean it, school has been good\" \n\nAnyway, later my dad talked to me and said\
  \ not to play dumb, he knows I don't really think all my teachers are nice, don't\
  \ like the actor in the movie I saw, don't really mean all the stuff I'm saying.\
  \ And he and his wife can tell, and it's hurting because they both want me to be\
  \ genuine.\n\nI said \"ok I'll try\" but TBH it is tiring enough for me to just\
  \ be polite let alone genuine. Plus I feel like I'm genuine, and talk about what's\
  \ actually on my mind, such as my mom, and being worried about her, it will go over\
  \ even worse\n\nWIBTA to not tell my stepmother more?"
