selftext: "This happened about five years ago when I was a college freshman, and I\
  \ still cringe every time I think about it. \n\nI used to be friends/roommates with\
  \ this guy named Jeremy, who liked to mess with me and play stupid pranks. Usually\
  \ it was just dumb stuff like drawing dicks and other embarrassing things on my\
  \ face when I was drunk. But one time I fell asleep without shutting off my laptop,\
  \ and he decided it would be funny to go into my Facebook account and change my\
  \ status to something like \"It's been so hard for me to find the courage to share\
  \ this, but I want to let everyone know that I'm gay.\" \n\nI woke up the next morning\
  \ and immediately saw the status, and there were about thirty comments underneath\
  \ it. Two or three people had realized right away that someone had gotten into my\
  \ account, but there were a lot of comments from random friends and acquaintances\
  \ saying they supported me and more than few who wrote things like \"I knew the\
  \ whole time!\" and \"that explains so much.\" That isn't something I would care\
  \ about now, but man, as an awkward 18 year old dude who had a lot of insecurities\
  \ about never having had a girlfriend and how other people perceived me, it was\
  \ like a punch to the gut. \n\nI quickly deleted everything and posted a new status\
  \ explaining that one of my friends had hacked my account. I reiterated multiple\
  \ times that I was definitely, absolutely NOT gay and I didn't know why everyone\
  \ was assuming that I was. I was really pissed.           \n\nIn retrospect, I probably\
  \ didn't handle things very well. I don't think I should have gotten so angry and\
  \ defensive, because maybe that implied that being gay was a bad or negative thing,\
  \ when of course it's not. I like to think I've grown a lot since then, and I don't\
  \ know if I'm just overthinking things or if I did actually mess up as badly as\
  \ I think I did. AITA?"
