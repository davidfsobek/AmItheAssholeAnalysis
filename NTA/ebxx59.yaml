selftext: "Okay, I own a nice set of stainless steel Le' Creuset pots and pans, $500+\
  \ worth.  My roommate who is home all the time constantly used my nicest pans to\
  \ cook his 2 eggs in the morning, fails to clean promptly then doesn't clean them\
  \ fully and puts it back dirty. I also notice scratch's from not using the correct\
  \ utensils/incorrect cleaning pads on the surface.  There was a day when i realized\
  \ im less likely to get angry over this stuff if all of the roommates just wouldn't\
  \ use my nicest shit. So I preceded to politely ask all of them to refrain from\
  \ using my le creuset pots and pans unless I was cooking with them. Explained it\
  \ took me years before I purchased this top level equipment and I used thrift store\
  \ pots and pans for years before which i still have and use. \n\nOne week later\
  \ my brother told me the roommate who was the worst offender had left one of my\
  \ pans out, dirty, and when asked about it said oh shit i better clean that before\
  \ he (Me) gets home. This pissed me off because I wasn't mean when asking to stop\
  \ using my stuff, I felt bad for even asking, then this dude just ignores the fuck\
  \ out of me. \n\nSo I ordered a luggage wire and lock. Ran the wire through all\
  \ of my handles and locked all of my pots and pans together so no one can use them.\n\
  \nAITA?"
