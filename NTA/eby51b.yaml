selftext: "I was on a pretty long flight yesterday and they had private screens for\
  \ each person to watch movies and tv shows. I found a horror movie I had been meaning\
  \ to watch for a while and started watching it. Maybe 15 minutes into the movie,\
  \ this grown woman in the seat next to mine taps me on the shoulder and tells me\
  \ that she\u2019s scared of scary movies and asks me to turn it off. I offered to\
  \ turn the brightness down on my screen so she could barely see it from the angle\
  \ \n She was seated at. She then told me that she would still be tempted to look\
  \ over at my screen if there was something going on and she didn\u2019t want to\
  \ catch something scary on screen by accident. I told her that she could either\
  \ request to move seats or not pay attention cause this wasn\u2019t my problem anymore.\
  \ I put my headphones in and proceeded to ignore her the rest of the flight. She\
  \ didn\u2019t complain to the flight attendant or anything but she was super huffy\
  \ and passive aggressive the rest of the flight (like ignoring me the first few\
  \ times I asked her to make some space for me to get up and go to the bathroom).\
  \ I also want to add that she slept for like 70-80% of the time I was watching the\
  \ movie. AITA here? I know it was petty of me to not turn it off but I feel like\
  \ if I paid a couple thousand for an international flight I should have the freedom\
  \ to watch whatever I want. I told my sister what happened and she told me that\
  \ I was being an asshole and I should have just watched the horror movie when I\
  \ got home. Now I feel a little bad for not accommodating her."
title: AITA if I refused to turn off a horror movie on my private screen on the airplane?
