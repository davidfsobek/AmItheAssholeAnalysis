selftext: "So to give a bit of context here: I've been seeing my partner January of\
  \ this year. We're both guys, I'm 22 and he's 24. We've lived together since August.\
  \ \n\nI've spent Christmas alone for the past six years as my parents kicked me\
  \ out when I came out to them at 16 and my entire family cut contact. My partner\
  \ has the opposite relationship with his family. They're all super close and like\
  \ to have big family gatherings on holidays and birthdays. I've met his parents\
  \ and both of his sisters, as well his sisters' husbands and kids and got along\
  \ well with all of them. \n\nHonestly, one of the things I was most looking forwards\
  \ to being with him, especially living with him, was having someone to spend Christmas\
  \ with. In the run up to December, I found myself actually getting super hyped to\
  \ spend Chrsitmas with his family and actually have a bunch of people around on\
  \ the day for the first time in so long.\n\nThat all kinda got squashed at the start\
  \ of the month. His mum basically said that I wouldn't be able to spend Christmas\
  \ with them because it's family only in their household, meaning only blood relatives\
  \ and their spouses and kids. Since my boyfriend and I aren't married and haven't\
  \ really been together that long, I'm not to go over for Christmas, though I'm welcome\
  \ to spend New Year with them. \n\nHonestly? I'm fucking devastated. I'm not even\
  \ expecting to get gifts or anything like that, I was just looking forwards to not\
  \ being by myself on the day again. It caused a bit of a back and forth between\
  \ one of his sisters and I. I didn't explicitly say anything to his family but I\
  \ did ask if my partner wouldn't mind at least coming home after dinner and stuff\
  \ instead of staying overnight like he usually would. I guess he passed it along\
  \ cause she got mad at me for being entitled and trying to keep him from his family.\
  \ He's now basically offering to not go at all, but I don't want that because I'd\
  \ feel bad if he missed out on family time because of me. I'm still really really\
  \ upset that I've been excluded and I've cried about it a couple of times. His sisters\
  \ are now both not really speaking to me and it's causing tension for him in his\
  \ family. I feel really really bad for causing all of this. Am I objectively an\
  \ arsehole?"
