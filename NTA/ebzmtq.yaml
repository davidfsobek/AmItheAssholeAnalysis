selftext: "Here\u2019s a little background- My (19f) best friend (let\u2019s call\
  \ her Anna, 19f) and I recently started college, and since we didn\u2019t want to\
  \ deal with the dorms we decided to share an apartment. Everything has been going\
  \ pretty well and we get along great. \nI\u2019m super close to Anna\u2019s parents\
  \ as well, they were practically my second family growing up. \n\nI\u2019ve always\
  \ been on the smaller side and had a hard time gaining weight, recently I went to\
  \ the doctor and he recommended a diet for me to try that should help me put some\
  \ pounds on. Anna has always been on the bigger side but honestly I\u2019ve never\
  \ thought this was a big deal at all. It never even crossed my mind really. \n\n\
  I\u2019m a very private person and told nobody about my diet but Anna sees what\
  \ I eat because I live with her. Her parents also visit often and noticed that I\
  \ was eating fattier foods in an attempt to gain weight.\n\nI recently got a message\
  \ from them asking me to change my diet, as Anna has tried to copy what I eat and\
  \ they are afraid she doesn\u2019t realize that this will have the opposite effect\
  \ she wants. They also asked that I explain my diet to her. I texted back that while\
  \ I can see where they are coming from my diet isn\u2019t something I can change,\
  \ but I wouldn\u2019t mind eating in my bedroom instead of the living room if they\
  \ thought that would help. I didn\u2019t address the comment about explaining what\
  \ I eat to her because that seemed like the parents job to teach their child nutrition.\
  \ I never got a reply but didn\u2019t think much of it. I feel like this is so unfair\
  \ to Anna they aren\u2019t treating her like an adult, I would be mortified if my\
  \ parents reached out the way hers did. I got the impression she didn\u2019t know\
  \ her mom and dad messaged me and I don\u2019t want to bring it up and embarrass\
  \ her. So I just left it there. \n\nFast forward this week and her parents came\
  \ over for dinner. It was really awkward because they usually are friendly towards\
  \ me and engage me in conversation but this week they ignored me and gave me dirty\
  \ looks. I didn\u2019t think I was being unreasonable but their reaction gave me\
  \ the impression that maybe what I said was unfair. \n\nSo, Reddit AITA?\n\nEDIT:\
  \ So I had a lot of replies telling me to talk to Anna about my diet. This morning\
  \ I was able to kind of casually bring it up. I pretty much stole someone else\u2019\
  s idea from the comments and said \u201Cwow I think this new diet is helping me\
  \ gain weight\u201D \U0001F602. Anna was pretty shocked and asked why I was dieting.\
  \ I explained my doctors visit to her and she was super nice about it. I guess I\
  \ didn\u2019t really have any reason to be embarrassed. She never talked about copying\
  \ what I eat so maybe it was just unintentional. Anyway, now she knows! I\u2019\
  m going to try to bring up the parents text message when I feel like the time is\
  \ right."
