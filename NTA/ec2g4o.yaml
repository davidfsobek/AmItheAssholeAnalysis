selftext: "I (22F) have always had a rocky relationship with my parents but some recent\
  \ events have me wondering if I should cut them off. \n\nMy dad always told me that\
  \ I should get a good education and not worry about money since he would take care\
  \ of it. He paid for my tuition and living expenses during my 4 years, except when\
  \ I took up a part-time job for 2 years and paid for my living expense. \n\nFreshman\
  \ year, I found out that my dad had an excel sheet keeping track of the amount he\
  \ has spent on me for college. This includes charges like tuition, and living expenses\
  \ as well as small charges like SAT test fees, and uber fees. Basically it\u2019\
  s a record of every cent I spend of his. Throughout my 4 years, he would constantly\
  \ threaten me with \u201Cif you don\u2019t do as I say I will stop paying for you.\u201D\
  \ \n\nAt graduation, 2 of my guy friends came to congratulate me, one who is also\
  \ a close family friend. After I did my graduation walk, I gave both of them hugs\
  \ and my parents FLIPPED OUT when we got home. After a few hours of yelling at me,\
  \ they said that I am not allowed to talk to my guy friends anymore. I said okay\
  \ to keep the peace in the house, but kept talking to them.\n\nAfter graduation\
  \ they wanted me to meet a guy (he was 26) who they wanted me to marry. I said no\
  \ the whole time but they insisted \u201Cjust meet him, you never know. We\u2019\
  re not forcing you, you still have the final say in this.\u201D When they met him,\
  \ THEY immediately rejected him because \u201Che was too fat.\u201D\n\nIn September,\
  \ I started working. After a few weeks, I asked my dad about opening my own personal\
  \ bank account. He said I don\u2019t need to open one since I already had 2 credit\
  \ cards and a checking account (all are joint with him.) I suspected that he said\
  \ this so he can monitor my money. I went ahead and made my own checking account\
  \ and credit card without telling him.\n\nMy dad found out about my bank account,\
  \ called and said \u201Cwhy isn\u2019t your direct deposit coming to your account\
  \ anymore?\u201D I told him that I made a new account and didn\u2019t tell him about\
  \ it because I didn\u2019t think I needed to. He immediately started yelling at\
  \ me and demanded that I pay for my own phone bill, and car insurance and start\
  \ paying him back for the tuition he paid (he says it was 70k). He also said that\
  \ he\u2019s going to take my off of his will/inheritance. \n\nI\u2019m really thinking\
  \ about just cutting my parents off once and for all since all the stuff that my\
  \ dad said to me this morning means that he\u2019s disowning me. I have not talked\
  \ to my parents since that morning. My dad says that all of the other college kids\
  \ pay for their own tuition and that he should have made me do the same thing. Am\
  \ I being entitled? Should I start paying it back?\n\nSo what does Reddit think?\
  \ AITA here?"
