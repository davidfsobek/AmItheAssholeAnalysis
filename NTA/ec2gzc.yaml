selftext: 'Wasn''t sure how to title it but here is the situation: Am I the asshole
  for confronting my mom about a situation with my son. My son (6) didn''t want to
  kiss my mom, instead he just wanted to hug her and so my mom said oh well you can''t
  get this surprise unless you kiss Grandma. This has happened a couple of times in
  the past and I haven''t liked it. I know she doesn''t mean anything malicious but
  because of past traumas I have had, I have an aversion to touch and this just really
  upset me to see. So I confronted her politely and said please don''t try to make
  him do something he is uncomfortable with and told my son you don''t have to kiss
  grandma if you don''t want to- esp not for a bribe and my mom got really offended
  and upset.

  She told me that just because I hate when people try to show affection to me I shouldn''t
  project that on my kid and "mess him up".


  Naturally all of us were upset at this point so I just left. So, did I over react?
  I just get a gross feeling thinking about my child being bribed into showing affection
  that he didn''t want to show even if I know my mom didn''t mean anything bad...
  Am I just projecting my traumas onto my son? Not sure if I''m just the big asshole
  here.

  EDIT: Wow I didn''t expect so many responses I want to thank all of you so much
  for your different perspectives, opinions, advice and most importantly SUPPORT.
  I will continue to have my sons back on this.  I will be having a calm discussion
  with my mom this weekend about this topic to hopefully relieve any tension. Wish
  me luck!'
