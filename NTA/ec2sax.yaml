selftext: "So, because of a bunch of convoluted shit I won\u2019t get into, I ended\
  \ up taking care of a pregnant husky. She gave birth to a litter of really beautiful\
  \ puppies. Not purebred huskies, but still super adorable\u2014we think maybe dad\
  \ was a German Shepherd, or a mutt with some German Shepherd. Anyway, I digress,\
  \ puppies are adorable little horrors. \n\nMy aunt came over to visit and play with\
  \ the puppies with her kids. I was happy to bring them over because I wanted to\
  \ socialize the puppies with kids, as you do. Anyway, apparently Aunt was assuming\
  \ that I\u2019d automatically give her one of the puppies because I\u2019m her niece.\
  \ She was encouraging the kids to pick one out!\n\nMy issue is that (1) I think\
  \ she\u2019s a terrible pet owner, they have a cat which is actively tortured by\
  \ the kids and the litter box is always full, (2) they live in an apartment so the\
  \ dog wouldn\u2019t have a yard, and (3) the mom herself is basically like having\
  \ a tornado in the house, she needs tons of exercise and mental stimulation, I am\
  \ sure the puppies will be the same, and nobody in the family is inclined in my\
  \ opinion to give the dog the exercise it needs. I\u2019ve been picking out homes\
  \ for the puppies, going to the houses and everything (I really care about them\
  \ being safe), and picking out houses with big yards and ideally people who have\
  \ experience with big, intelligent dogs. I have several such people who want the\
  \ puppies and are willing to pay the $200 fee. The $200 includes, by the way, all\
  \ of their shots, deworming, and spaying/neutering.\n\nI told this to my aunt, not\
  \ including the fact that I think she\u2019s a bad pet owner\u2014just that I think\
  \ she doesn\u2019t have the resources for such a big and intelligent dog. She latched\
  \ onto the $200 fee and started yelling at me for judging her because she\u2019\
  s not rich and just because my Dad is rich doesn\u2019t mean all of us are, I just\
  \ want to sell the puppies and get money, she can\u2019t afford a big houses and\
  \ her kids still deserve a dog, etc etc. I just got mad and told her to get out\
  \ of my house and agitating the dogs. Kids are crying.\n\nI\u2019ve been fielding\
  \ calls all this past week how I\u2019ve ruined the kids\u2019 Christmas, I\u2019\
  m shallow and care only about money, why would I give the dog to a stranger rather\
  \ than give it to my aunt and I can see it every day, etc etc. I still feel like\
  \ I\u2019m in the right but I don\u2019t know now, especially with pressure from\
  \ my Mom. My Dad says that I should just sell the dog but since he\u2019s divorced\
  \ from my Mom I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s biased against her + her sister. AITA?"
