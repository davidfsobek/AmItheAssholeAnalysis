selftext: "I made this account just to post this.\n\nI manage a luxury retail store\
  \ in a mall. I hired this guy (35M) when I was in a bad staffing spot, against my\
  \ better instincts. It has been a big regret the entire time. He is socially unaware,\
  \ rubs customers and other employees the wrong way, and doesnt follow my instructions\
  \ despite weeks of training. I also hired him with an open availability, and a month\
  \ ago he told me that he got a full time job and now can only work from 6PM-close\
  \ Monday thru Friday. \n\nThe cherry on top happened the other day. He arrived to\
  \ work visibly high, with droopy red eyes and his behaviors were very different\
  \ from normal. For example, he was dropping stuff all over and asked me twice in\
  \ 20 minutes what I had for lunch that day. After I left, he spent 90 minutes outside\
  \ of the store sleeping in one of the chairs in the mall! On the clock! \n\nThis\
  \ is definitely grounds for termination and I am pissed to say the least. The only\
  \ thing that is stopping me is that it's the week before Christmas. I feel really\
  \ bad firing someone just a few days before the holiday, WIBTA if I fired this guy\
  \ a few days before Christmas?"
