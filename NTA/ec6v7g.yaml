selftext: "I have a LDR with my girlfriend, and she visits me every Christmas, along\
  \ with some of her friends. But there's this one guy friend that she's close with\
  \ and he's coming to visit/hang out as well. They met before I came along through\
  \ an online game. So the thing is, he's going to rent an AirBnB, and she's going\
  \ to stay with him alone at the AirBnB for a few days, and they're going to share\
  \ the same bed because it's a really small AirBnB. I completely trust her, but it\
  \ just feels weird that she's going to sleep in the same bed, with a different guy.\
  \ Her reason for this is because, she wants to stay out late when she's here, but\
  \ doesn't want to come back to my place extremely late because she's worried she'll\
  \ be bothering my parents and doesn't want to accidentally wake them up in the middle\
  \ of the night while coming home (They sleep early 11pm-ish, and get up early for\
  \ work). (I'm still really young, like fresh out of college young, so I still live\
  \ with my parents).\n\nAITA for telling her that I'm uncomfortable with her sleeping\
  \ in the same bed with another guy, instead of just crashing at my place like she\
  \ usually does? I told her it's fine if she stays out late, my parents won't really\
  \ care. She still insisted that she will stay there. Then I suggested that I crash\
  \ there with them, I wouldn't mind sleeping on the couch alone, and she told me\
  \ the place is just really really small.\n\nSorry for the long-ish post, but note\
  \ that I do completely trust her, she won't go around messing with other guys, and\
  \ I am definitely not in denial or anything so please don't accuse her of cheating.\
  \ But AITA for feeling uncomfortable about this whole thing?  \n\n\nEdit: Okay for\
  \ everyone saying she's going to cheat on me. IF she were to, a really big IF, she\
  \ would have done so secretly. She would have told me she was coming a later date,\
  \ but actually arrived an earlier date. She wouldn't have asked me about it first,\
  \ maybe I shouldn't have left this out. About a month earlier she asked if it was\
  \ okay, at first I wasn't too fond of it, but I had a lot going on, finals/work/family\
  \ stuff, so I kinda shrugged it off. I also trusted the two of them, the guy in\
  \ question isn't a bad person at all, I've met him a few times, and he's a really\
  \ innocent kid. But recently, I'm more free and I put some thought into it, I felt\
  \ more uncomfortable about it"
