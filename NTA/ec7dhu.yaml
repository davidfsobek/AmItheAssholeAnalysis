selftext: "I hate some of my Dad\u2019s friends. One guy in particular is my Dad\u2019\
  s former carpenter. He\u2019s a super Uber Christian and is a raging homophobe.\
  \ I don\u2019t mean like \u201Coooo I disagree with gays politically no gay marriage\
  \ sanctities of marriage.\u201D He literally talks about gay people dying and burning\
  \ in hell gleefully. He has mentioned how gay marriage will lead to sex with children\
  \ and animals, and has said Russia has the right idea with the gay bashing\u2019\
  s. I have expressed to both my parents how much I HATE this guy and his homophobe\
  \ wife, but they continue to invite these people to our house and force me to interact\
  \ with them. \n\nSo Carpenter pulls me into a conversation I don\u2019t really want\
  \ to have at the party. I told him about college apps and going to Cape Cod this\
  \ summer with my friends. He commented \u201Coh, God hasn\u2019t burned that place\
  \ down or thrown it into the ocean yet?\u201D I was super mad so I responded, \u201C\
  Guess I didn\u2019t notice, I was too busy having sex with other girls!\u201D I\
  \ apparently was really loud, because a lot of people looked over. My Dad immediately\
  \ ran up and started doing damage control mostly \u201Cohhh teenagers say the darndest\
  \ things lol how silly!!!\u201D But both Carpenter and his wife were mad at the\
  \ \u201Cdisrespect\u201D and left. Now both of my parents are super mad at me but\
  \ I\u2019m mad at them for forcing me to play nice with this guy for so long, even\
  \ though they\u2019ve known I\u2019m a lesbian for years.\n\nAITA?"
