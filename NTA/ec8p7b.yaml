selftext: So my older sister called me yesterday and tells me she is having a tough
  time financially. This isn't anything new for her. So she tells me she is unsure
  if she will be able to afford gifts for my niece and nephew for Christmas this year.
  She then asks me if I could help her out this year. I told her I would be happy
  to. Within that same phone conversation she then proceeds to tell me the only person
  she has bought for is her boyfriend (he is a deadbeat, can never keep a job, 12
  years older than my sister, and I fucking hate him.) So basically she tells me she
  spent around $250 on him. I then proceeded to tell her that she is out of her mind
  and I will absolutely not help her buy gifts for my niece and nephew but rather
  I will buy them gifts and make sure they know that they are from me. I already get
  them gifts anyway but this year will be much more to make up for the lack of gifts
  from their mom.  In my mind she is telling the world that she cares about her piece
  of shit boyfriend more than her kids and expects people to condone this behavior.
title: AITA for telling my sister I'm not going to help her with gifts for my niece
  and nephew?
