selftext: "Let me preface this by saying that I (24m) and my gf (32f) who we'll call\
  \ Liv, have been seeing each other for close to a year now. I've been living in\
  \ a shared house with 8 blokes in a small 2x2m room that barely accommodates a single\
  \ bed. This is the sole reason why she doesn't sleep at mine. I'm saving a lot on\
  \ rent living here even though the living conditions are poor.\n\nNow, I've been\
  \ staying at my gfs house 4 nights a week for the past few months. Her beds bigger\
  \ for starters and I cant cook at home because it's always congested, so Liv and\
  \ I cook a meal twice a week at hers. She has a roommate who we'll call (Bianca)\
  \ that she's known for quite a few years and they get along fine. I've tried my\
  \ best to get to know Bianca but it's not reciprocated and I can feel the awkward\
  \ tension between us a mile away. She's never asked a question about what I do for\
  \ work, or anything of the like, and typically responds with one word answers.\n\
  \nLiv told me that Bianca feels very uncomfortable living with me. I hate being\
  \ the cause of her discomfort. Whenever I'm at Livs house, I don't use the living\
  \ room and go straight to Livs room whenever i arrive (usually late after work).\
  \ Besides cooking with Liv, I'm usually mindful of my time spent in the bathroom.\n\
  \nHere's where Liv and I may have screwed up. We were taking a shower together and\
  \ took a bit longer than usual (20-30mins). All of a sudden Bianca comes out of\
  \ the room and slams the front door shut and sends Liv an angry text about taking\
  \ too long and that she needed to use the bathroom and that she's selfish etc. \n\
  We both put ourselves in her situation and said we would've knocked on the bathroom\
  \ door to ask us to hurry up if we were busting, but she's a bit more timid than\
  \ we are.\n\nTheir relationships gone down the gutters since I came along and I\
  \ can't help but feel responsible. \n\nOn an end note, Liv and I want to move in\
  \ together within a few more months after her lease finishes, but for now we're\
  \ stuck in this predicament.\n\nMy mates telling me I'm an asshole for staying over\
  \ 4 days a week rent free and I should respect the roommates boundaries and not\
  \ see her as frequently. But I see it as the next step before moving in together,\
  \ that I'm only there at night and it's normal for couples to see each other more\
  \ frequently before they move in. So AITA?"

  and causing her to flip out?
