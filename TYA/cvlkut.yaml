selftext: "So my situation is a little difficult so I thought I would confide in the\
  \ good professional people of reddit. Couple days ago me and my brother we\u2019\
  re hanging out late night doing regular guy things drinking, watching sports, etc.\
  \ We haven\u2019t seen each other in maybe 5-6 years so naturally we started talking\
  \ about life and what\u2019s been going on the past few years. Towards the end of\
  \ our conversation we started to get to the \u201Csecrets\u201D I mentioned something\
  \ along the lines that I smoked weed for the first time and did various other substances\
  \ (This was hard for me to tell because my whole life I was pretty much anti-drugs\
  \ and such.) We both laughed about it saying \u201CJust don\u2019t let mom find\
  \ out\u201D The joke died out after a little bit and then he just blurted out \u201C\
  I cheated on my wife...\u201D At first it didn\u2019t register until I saw his face\
  \ and he was dead serious. I for one hate cheaters, but I try to do my best not\
  \ to judge anyone for their actions. He begins explaining this was something that\
  \ happened about 4 years ago when his wife was always busy with work. She would\
  \ travel a lot and be away for weeks at a time. He told me they were going through\
  \ a tough time back then lots of arguing, not communicating, and that he felt really\
  \ lonely. During this same time my brother met a girl at his local gym, started\
  \ off as friends, slowly kept bonding and you guessed they did the sex. He told\
  \ me this occasion only happened once and pretty much cut her off after that night\
  \ because he started to feel guilty for a short while. Few months later his relationship\
  \ turned for the better for him and his wife. Pretty much after his wife\u2019s\
  \ travels slowed down his whole relationship has been great. They\u2019ve both gotten\
  \ promotions, bought a house, more family vacations. (They have a kid) \nHe told\
  \ me life has been good to him now and he\u2019s just thankful things have finally\
  \ worked out. \n\nAs stated before I hate cheaters and I\u2019ve always felt that\
  \ the person being cheated on always has the right know. I know for sure this would\
  \ probably destroy their marriage and there would be a fight for the kid. My heart\
  \ tells me I have to tell her because it\u2019s the right thing to do, especially\
  \ because I\u2019ve known my brother to cheat one other time on an ex-girlfriend\
  \ couple years before his current wife. My brain tells me it\u2019s none of my business\
  \ and I should keep my mouth shut. I don\u2019t want to see their kid go throughout\
  \ that kind pain either. On one hand I betray my brother if I say something on the\
  \ other hand I betray our close family friend because I know this secret and I don\u2019\
  t say anything. I wish he never told me, ignorance is truly bliss. So there it is,\
  \ WIBTA if I said something?\n\nTLDR: Brother Cheated on his wife years ago because\
  \ he was depressed, now everything is better and he told me about it, but now I\
  \ feel obligated to tell his wife because she\u2019s a close friend. WIBTA?\n\n\
  Edit: I\u2019m referring SIL as close family friend because my family and her family\
  \ have known each since elementary school days and thus are Very close lol. I thought\
  \ this iteration would make the relationship sound stronger than just SIL, but it\
  \ looks like I was wrong.\n\nSecond Edit: Wow this is on the front page, I never\
  \ intended nor expected this blow up as it did! I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t reply\
  \ to everyone, but there will be some kind of update."
