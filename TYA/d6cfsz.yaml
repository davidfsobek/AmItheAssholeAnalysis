selftext: "Let me just preface this by saying this: **I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO PROBLEM\
  \ WITH INTERRACIAL RELATIONSHIPS.** Now that the air is clear, let me continue.\
  \ \n\nMy daughter (Anna) has recently started to date an African American man (Jamal).\
  \ While I'm not exactly what you would refer to as \"liberal\", he's a nice young\
  \ man and as long as my daughter is happy, I'm happy. The problem is Anna is rather\
  \ naive about the community she lives in. While her friends are quite content to\
  \ see a relationship like hers, more than a few tongues are wagging in the community\
  \ and a few people have privately expressed their concern to me. As I said, I have\
  \ no problem with mixed relationships and I've set them straight, but I am painfully\
  \ aware of how these matters are viewed by certain segments of the population.\n\
  \nMy parents are planning to come and stay with us for a week and Anna expressed\
  \ a desire to introduce Jamal to them now that things were getting more serious\
  \ between them. I told her on no uncertain terms that this wasn't going to happen.\
  \ I may have no problem with Jamal, but they *absolutely will*, and even when the\
  \ relationship ends they won't forget it. They might even go as far as to cut her\
  \ off entirely. Anna was extremely upset by this and implied I was a racist and\
  \ more concerned with what my parents think than how she feels.\n\nAs I said, I\
  \ know my parents. They simply aren't okay with mixed relationships and if Anna\
  \ were to bring Jamal over even as a friend, they would be furious both at her *and*\
  \ me.\n\nAnna is currently staying with Jamal and doesn't want to speak with me\
  \ right now. My wife stands by me given she knows very well how my parents are (they\
  \ had a problem with her for months over the *length of the skirt* she wore when\
  \ I introduced her to them, for christs sake), but a close friend I confided in\
  \ told me that I have behaved like an ass and that I needed to focus more on my\
  \ daughter than pleasing my parents.\n\nNo advice needed, but I have to know. Have\
  \ I been an ass?"

  to her grandparents?
