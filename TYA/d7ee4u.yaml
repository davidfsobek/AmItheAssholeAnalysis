selftext: 'I (17M) eat a good amount of food. Based on my body type and physical activity,
  I''ve been eating well over 4,000 calories a day to maintain my current weight.


  My aunt got married last weekend in a venue close to my parents'' house. It was
  originally scheduled for the morning, but problems with catering and the venue/DJ
  meant that they rescheduled it for that evening at the last minute.


  This was problematic because I needed to attend my afternoon swim practice that
  day, as I had only been excused for the morning one. I ended up going to both practices,
  had to change into my tux right outside the weight room, and drove directly there.
  I only ate a protein bar during the drive, so I was thrilled to find a well-stocked
  buffet after the reception.


  I loaded my plate, then went back for seconds. I was going to get a third round
  when my mom pulled me aside. She had been giving me weird looks during the meal,
  and told me to cut it out, and that if I was still hungry I could make something
  when we got home.


  Now, I would have ordinarily agreed with her, but when we helped chip in for the
  wedding, we paid for two meals instead of one for me. I ate a good amount, but I
  doubt it was more than double whatever everyone else was eating.


  She eventually gave in and let me get a third serving. I would have eaten more,
  but she put her foot down. There was still some extra food left once the meal service
  ended.


  Once we left, my mom went on a rant about how I was "making aunt and her fiancee
  fund my cheat day." I told her that it was the guests paying for the catering, not
  them, and I wasn''t depriving anyone else since I went back for more once most people
  were done.


  I''m not sure if I violated some social norm, but I feel like I was justified. AITA,
  Reddit?


  EDIT: I don''t know if this matters, but I was mainly eating chicken and lamb, not
  veggies or rice/bread. There was still some leftover, though.'
