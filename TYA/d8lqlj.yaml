selftext: "I work at an office where I\u2019m allowed to have a beard and long hair,\
  \ but my manager is stringent on the \u201Cno jeans policy.\u201D She frequently\
  \ ensures that no one is wearing jeans and is wearing professional attire. \n\n\
  Problem is, for the past few months that I\u2019ve been here, the women of the office\
  \ have always worn jeans. Tight, dark, professional looking jeans, but jeans nonetheless.\
  \ That is, until a few days ago. \n\nI love wearing jeans, and have always felt\
  \ I could make them professional too. I was complaining about it to a friend and\
  \ coworker when my manager walked into the staff room. She said something basically\
  \ confirming her stance on jeans. \n\nI said \u201CWell, the girls get to wear jeans.\u201D\
  \n\n\u201CNo they don\u2019t.\u201D\n\nThen, my coworker, Amanda walked in wearing\
  \ jeans. I pointed that out. My manager confronted Amanda, telling her that she\
  \ wasn\u2019t allowed to wear jeans. \n\nIn the moment, Amanda appeared playfully\
  \ mad at me. But I went over her house last weekend, and she brought up the incident\
  \ twice, again sort of playfully, but I think she may actually be mad. I apologized,\
  \ saying I didn\u2019t want to ruin jeans for women but to prove that someone can\
  \ look professional in jeans. \n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT/ UPDATE: Wow, did not expect all\
  \ of the responses, though I can\u2019t say I\u2019m surprised about the polarization.\
  \ At work today, it wasn\u2019t bad. Only one other girl spoke to me, and she too\
  \ was more playfully mad than anything. I do feel bad that I ruined jeans for the\
  \ women, though perhaps one day I will work in a place where jeans will be permitted\
  \ for all. Thank you for all of your input and the silvers!"
