selftext: "Ok so me (f25) and my fiance (m24) are getting married next year and like\
  \ many people our age we are pretty grossed out by the wedding industry and are\
  \ trying to keep our wedding as cheap as possible.\nSo for example we are having\
  \ the ceremony and reception at my uncle\u2019s farm (free of charge) out in the\
  \ country, my good friend from college who owns a catering business agreed to do\
  \ our catering for free as a wedding gift, and my fianc\xE9\u2019s good friends\
  \ with a band that will play at our wedding for free also as a wedding gift. We\
  \ got my dress and his suit from Goodwill and got them altered. Everything said\
  \ and done we will be paying less than $2k for our wedding. \n\nNow we get to the\
  \ alcohol. We\u2019re having a semi-big wedding (150 people - we have a ton of friends\
  \ and family coming from all over) and the idea of paying for all of that booze\
  \ is making us stressed out. It\u2019d be at least $1k. We thought about it and\
  \ decided to do a cash bar. We figured we could buy the booze and pay one of my\
  \ cousins to be bartender for the night, and we realized we could probably recoup\
  \ some of our costs on the other wedding expenses by charging moderate prices for\
  \ drinks - win-win! We were set on this idea until I brought it up with one of my\
  \ bridesmaids and she flipped out and said that would be incredibly tacky.\n\nI\
  \ was sort of taken aback by this. I\u2019ve looked online and cash bars at weddings\
  \ are pretty common. it seems ridiculous to pay to get everyone drunk. My other\
  \ friends and family seem pretty split and I\u2019m starting to wonder if this is\
  \ actually a faux pas. Am I the asshole?"
