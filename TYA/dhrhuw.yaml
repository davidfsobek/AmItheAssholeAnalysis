selftext: "Healthy eating is super important to me. I have small children at home,\
  \ and a large part of my mental space is occupied by thinking about how I can ensure\
  \ that my family has a generally healthy diet. I'm not completely obsessed. The\
  \ kids eat cake and ice cream at parties. We take them out to ice cream now and\
  \ then. I give them a few pieces of chocolate in their lunches. We do a special\
  \ breakfast once a week where the kids can vote on pancakes, waffles, crepes, etc.\
  \ But I see healthy eating as one of the most important values that I can instill\
  \ in my family.\n\nThe kids usually choose crepes for their special breakfast. These\
  \ are the richest and least healthy option. I make pancakes and waffles with wheat\
  \ and oat flour, but crepes I do by our traditional family recipe--butter, sugar,\
  \ white flour\u2026 It's a special treat, and I want them to enjoy it. The only\
  \ filling we use is pure maple syrup, and the one thing I ask is that we don't use\
  \ a ton of it. Crepe batter is super rich, maple syrup has lots of sugar, and it\
  \ is very expensive. I tell them a little goes a long way. Plus, it's healthier\
  \ to use just a little!\n\nWe roll our crepes like a burrito, and just like putting\
  \ ingredients in a burrito, I ask everyone to apply a single line of syrup down\
  \ the center along the roll rather than pouring haphazardly all over the surface.\
  \ Not only does it help us use less, but it\u2019s reasonable given the burrito\
  \ roll method. (When you cut it into small sections, each bite will have the same\
  \ amount of syrup in the center.) The kids get the rationale, and I make sure that\
  \ I lead by example.\n\nMy wife can't get behind the single line of syrup thing\
  \ though. She likes sweet things and uses lots of syrup on her crepes. She pours\
  \ in a spiral over the whole surface, using about 3x what anyone else does. For\
  \ a long time, when she helped the kids fill their crepes, she refused to pour a\
  \ single line, instead slathering syrup all over. I think it was a sort of protest,\
  \ as she sees me as being too nitpicky. After a lot of complaining on my part, she\
  \ did change, but it was a real headache.\n\nI want her to jump on board with the\
  \ syrup thing so that we can send a consistent message to the kids. I have suggested\
  \ this to her on various occasions and explained my reasoning carefully. I don't\
  \ think it's unreasonable or irrational to think that we should have a family policy\
  \ around this, and I have trouble understanding why this should represent a significant\
  \ problem for her.\n\nShe thinks I'm being unreasonable and irrational in asking\
  \ this of her--that it's purely a matter of preference and that I shouldn't be pressuring\
  \ her in any direction. I want us to be a team on this. This is the only breakfast\
  \ for which I feel the need to have such family standards--I don't say anything\
  \ specific about pancakes, waffles, etc. (you need to spread syrup all over the\
  \ surface of those, although I do still want people to be modest about syrup use).\n\
