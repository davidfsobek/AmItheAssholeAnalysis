  \ here. I will do my best to keep my big mouth shut in future and avoid further\
  \ fuck-ups and general assholery. \n\nHowever I would like to point out that most\
  \ of the people who have identified themselves as \u2018asian\u2019 in the comments\
  \ have indicated NAH or NTA. I suspect there may be a bit of a cultural divide here.\
  \ \n\nThanks for the amazing laughs you\u2019ve all given my wife and I! \n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\
  \nI posted this on tifu, and several redditors suggested I should cross-post here.\
  \ \n\nMy kid is half Chinese and half Caucasian. He was born in Hong Kong. I\u2019\
  ve lived in hk for a really long time, so despite my completely western appearance,\
  \ I speak Cantonese at a nearly native level. That said, I\u2019ve never had to\
  \ learn medical terms related to infants, so therefore I was learning a lot on the\
  \ fly.\n\nJust a few days after my son was born, we had to take him for a regular\
  \ check-up. At the check-up the did the usual weight/length measurements and asked\
  \ us about his eating habits.\n\nAfter a fairly extensive check, the nurse said\
  \ she was worried about his digestion and asked us to hang around and see a specialist.\n\
  \nAfter spending about half an hour worrying what may be wrong, the specialist called\
  \ us in and examined my son.\n\nAfter a minute, she announced (in Cantonese) that\
  \ he was \u2018very yellow\u2019.\n\nMy immediate response was \u2018Of course he\
  \ is, he\u2019s half Chinese.\u2019\n\nBoth my wife and the doctor turned to me\
  \ with horrified looks on their faces. The doctor then clarified that \u2018yellow\u2019\
  \ in fact meant jaundice. Apparently, it can be fatal and his situation was pretty\
  \ critical.\n\nNeedless to say, the ride to the hospital with my wife was icily\
  \ quiet.\n\nTl;dr I confused the Cantonese word for yellow with the word for Jaundice,\
  \ leading me to make something of a racist joke in front of a doctor treating my\
  \ newborn son and my wife."
