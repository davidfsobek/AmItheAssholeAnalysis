selftext: "I know how the title sounds, but try to imagine being around someone who\
  \ never even tells little white lies that every other person routinely does. He's\
  \ a great guy, I love him to bits and he doesn't have a malicious bone in his body\
  \ but he prioritizes being honest above everything. He's not one of those \"brutal\
  \ honesty\" people, and he doesn't give his own opinion without it being solicited\
  \ and pass it off as just being honest, but he will tell the truth without sugarcoating\
  \ it as well.\n\nExamples would be when a mutual friend who is *extremely* obese\
  \ was upset about not being able to find a partner and asked us why he wasn't having\
  \ success. My boyfriend asked him if he actually wanted his opinion, and when our\
  \ friend said yes my boyfriend said \"because you're obese, you don't take care\
  \ of your health and people don't see that as an attractive quality in a partner.\"\
  \ I know he was trying to help and actually really likes this friend but holy shit.\
  \ \n\nOther times, I've bought him gifts for birthdays or christmas and he's said\
  \ \"I appreciate the time you put into choosing this for me, but it's not really\
  \ something I'd enjoy. I'd rather you return it so you don't waste your money\"\
  \ or he'll sometimes stop eating when I cook something. I'll ask \"Not feeling well?\"\
  \ and he'll say \"I feel alright, I just don't like this but thank you for cooking\
  \ tonight.\" Same deal if I cut my hair or get a new outfit. He'll always tell me\
  \ I look beautiful, but if I ask him what he really thinks he'll be 100% honest\
  \ as in \"it makes you look like you have a muffin top\" or \"I think that style\
  \ ages you\" if he doesn't like it. \n\nThis came to a head recently when I brought\
  \ him to a party with people from my work. We were mingling and my token nosy coworker\
  \ started to chat him up. It was going well and he was entirely polite to her, until\
  \ she started oversharing stories about her upbringing despite us not reciprocating\
  \ and then said \"ok, your turn!\" to him. He said \"No thank you.\" She said \"\
  Was your childhood really that boring!?\" at which point he says \"I wouldn't say\
  \ so. I just find the question to be extremely invasive and I don't feel like sharing\
  \ that information with you, I've just met you and I'm not sure why you'd share\
  \ what you've shared with me.\" I pulled him away after that and scolded him.\n\n\
  I really do appreciate the fact that I can trust he'll always be honest with me\
  \ and I don't need to worry about hidden feelings. And he's never cruel in his honesty\
  \ and only speaks up when directly asked or put on the spot like at the party. But\
  \ at the same time I'm used to literally everyone else telling white lies. Just\
  \ saying \"thanks\" for small gifts and pretending they like it, or saying \"yeah,\
  \ I had a big snack earlier\" when they don't eat a meal you made or even telling\
  \ small lies or at least hiding the truth to annoying people in social situations\
  \ for the sake of keeping the peace. \n\nI don't know if I'm the asshole or if he\
  \ is, or if this is just a personality difference."
