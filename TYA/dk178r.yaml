selftext: "Several months ago I lent \"John\" some music equipment so we could make\
  \ some covers just for fun. This includes recording equipment, an electric guitar\
  \ and an amp. He was living with his parents at the time of the accident and had\
  \ all of my gear in his room. I would often come over and we would jam and have\
  \ fun, and I got on well with his parents too. His parents were aware that he didn't\
  \ own the equipment as he didn't have a job (he was just out of highschool), so\
  \ they must have known that I was the actual owner.\n\nAbout a fortnight ago he\
  \ went out on his motorbike to see his gf. Her house is also in the same suburb\
  \ as us, but has roundabouts everywhere with concrete curbs in the middle. I've\
  \ seen the marks across it, but evidently he hit this curb, lost control and fell\
  \ off the bike. \n\nI got called by his brother the next day, saying that John had\
  \ passed away in hospital overnight after being injured in an accident. Obviously\
  \ I was crushed, we weren't best friends but this is the first time someone in a\
  \ social circle of mine has died. We talked for a little bit, and then there was\
  \ an awkward silence which I didn't know how to deal with. I brought up the music\
  \ gear and basically asked for it back. His brother got angry, started shouting\
  \ and swearing and then hung up. \n\nLater his parents called mine and mine came\
  \ and confronted me about it. It turned into an unnecessary argument because they\
  \ thought that I was completely apathetic to his death. Apparently John's brother\
  \ had spun the story that I didn't consider him a friend and that's why I wanted\
  \ the equipment back immediately. He told this story to his parents and they told\
  \ it to my parents. I couldn't even contest the claim because my parents don't care\
  \ about context or that I didn't mean anything bad by it.\n\nI didn't go to his\
  \ funeral. When other friends asked, John's brother told them his story, which pissed\
  \ me off so badly. Now my family and friends are calling me an asshole, and my explanation\
  \ doesn't make sense to them because they can't (or refuse to) empathise with someone\
  \ who is simply bad at dealing with social cues. What pisses me off even more is\
  \ the family shutting down any chance for reconciliation by going dark. What do\
  \ they expect me to do about it?\n\nOn top of dealing with the loss of John I have\
  \ to deal with all of these people burning bridges. I might actually be fucked.\
  \ Did I bring this upon myself?"
