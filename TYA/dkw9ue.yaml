selftext: "Hello all, very intrigued as to opinions on the following:\n\n&#x200B;\n\
  \nI am a heavy sleeper, and I mean a HEAVY sleeper. Because of this my first alarm\
  \ wakes me up 3.5 hours before my shift at work starts, and in case I don't wake\
  \ up I have alarms every 30 minutes to periodically wake me up and ensure I don't\
  \ go back to sleep/oversleep etc so I can get to work on time every day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\
  \nLately the person who lives in the apartment below me has been banging on the\
  \ wall/ceiling when my alarm goes off, which I'm guessing is because it goes off\
  \ at 5.30am.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis morning, my alarm went off at 5.30am and there\
  \ was no banging, but I was too tired to get up and slapped the snooze button. 5.40am\
  \ the alarm finishes it's snooze cycle and goes off again, at which point I turn\
  \ it off.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n5.45am I hear loud banging on my apartment door, very aggressive\
  \ and continuous banging. I would describe it as \"open the damn door\" knocking.\
  \ I ignore it because I'm too tired to deal with confrontation and I don't want\
  \ to end up in a shouting match that wakes up the rest of the residents. Then they\
  \ go downstairs outside the building, and start pressing the buzzer for my apartment\
  \ and just holding it so it's a constant buzzing. Then I unplug the receiver and\
  \ the noise stopped.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have emailed my building manager to advise\
  \ of the situation and for them to suggest the best course of action moving forward,\
  \ but I have the following questions:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Am I the asshole because\
  \ my alarm is too early?\n2. Am I the asshole if I'm a heavy sleeper and require\
  \ 3/4 alarms over a 2 hour period to wake me up?\n3. What actions would you take\
  \ in response to the actions of my neighbour?\n\nEDIT: Fair to say I didn't expect\
  \ this many responses!\n\nA bit of additional info for those who have related comments,\
  \ I go to bed at 10pm and my first alarm is at 5.30am if I start work at 8am. I\
  \ leave the house at 7.30am.\n\nI've tried setting my alarm for 7am but after 9\
  \ hours of sleep I find myself really struggling to find the energy or 'get up and\
  \ go' and end up being late for work. Those of you who get up easily will call me\
  \ lazy, those who are in the same boat I thank you for your understanding.\n\nMy\
  \ alarm does not go off the entire time, it goes off for about 3/4 seconds at 5.30am,\
  \ 6am, 6.30am and 7am.\n\nThank you for all of your comments. Some of them are ironic\
  \ as you are calling me an asshole while being an asshole yourself but lots of helpful\
  \ comments here and thank you to those who said YTA and delivered their response\
  \ respectfully. I'm not a rude or disrespectful person but I've not lived in a complex\
  \ like this before and I've lived with many roommates over many years who have never\
  \ complained about my alarms so this is more about ignorance on my part.\n\nI'll\
  \ make changes to make my alarm go off later and quieter; person downstairs can\
  \ hear because my bedroom is directly above hers. It's worth noting that I don't\
  \ think my alarm is THAT loud, and my partner rarely wakes up to my first alarm.\n\
  \nTo those of you who suggested earphones I actually sleep with earphones in but\
  \ they always fall out by morning time; suggestions welcome.\n\nTo those of you\
  \ who suggested moving my alarm/phone across the room I will try that.\n\nTo those\
  \ of you who suggested something buzzing or flashing I will look into it, open to\
  \ suggestions if there are affordable products available.\n\nTo those who said the\
  \ neighbours actions were justified, I still disagree. There are more amicable ways\
  \ to deal with things like this, hence me not answering the door (to avoid an aggressive\
  \ neighbour) and putting this post to see opinions so I can empathize with the neighbour.\
  \ I don't want to piss them off, I just want to get to work on time and I have a\
  \ hard time forcing myself to get up quickly in the morning.\n\nThanks again for\
  \ all the helpful comments\n\nEDIT 2: I do ignore my alarms or sleep through them.\
  \ The alarm goes off, I wake up and turn the alarm off. Then in my tired state I\
  \ fall back to sleep and the next alarm goes off 30 mins later. Today's occurrence\
  \ was when I hit snooze while I was half asleep, and then it went off 10 mins later\
  \ instead of 30.\n\nWhen I use the phrase \"heavy sleeper\" I don't mean that it's\
  \ impossible to stop me from sleeping, I mean that even after 7/8 hours sleep I\
  \ still find it difficult to wake up fully, resulting in me falling back to sleep\
  \ very quickly.\n\nEDIT 3: apologies if those who are voting YTA don't like my edits,\
  \ people are asking for more information and I'm just trying to answer questions\
  \ this way rather than replying to a thousand comments!\n\nPlease note one of my\
  \ edits where I did say that I'm going to make my alarms later and make it quieter,\
  \ and also look at the silent alarm options. I'm trying \U0001F602 set my alarm\
  \ for 6.30am today, no banging from my neighbour and only 1 alarm went off. Sat\
  \ here with a coffee trying to 'wake up' (i.e I'm awake but I feel groggy)\n\nThanks\
  \ again for all the suggestions in this post and I think while I live in this cardboard\
  \ box of a building I'll start by finding a quieter way to wake up at 5.30am, and\
  \ see a doctor about my sleep and my levels of tiredness.\n\nFINAL EDIT: Thank you\
  \ again for all the responses, opinions and suggestions and they have been delivered\
  \ in such a wonderfully varying manner of ways. Thanks also for the personal messages/chat\
  \ messages etc as well and the advice etc. My inbox has completely exploded! Due\
  \ to the volume, I won't continue to respond to any more comments or make further\
  \ edits, if you want to discuss this and would like a response then I will respond\
  \ to direct messages still :)"
