selftext: 'My wife and I are expecting our first in May.  We''ve been together 10+
  with 7 of them married so naturally we''ve discussed all things baby, family, etc.  One
  of the things that has come up before is the day of our little ones arrival.  I''ve
  stated in no uncertain terms that I believe the only ones in the delivery room outside
  of medical professionals should be her and I.  My wife however, has expressed that
  she''d like her mother to be in the room.  We haven''t discussed this in some time
  and definitely not since finding out we''re expecting, but I do anticipate the topic
  coming around again soon.


  I take issue with my MIL being there bc while she has been very supportive throughout
  the process (unsuccessful attempts for years followed by several rounds of IVF)
  I''m of the opinion that this is one of those bonding moments for us and us alone
  since we are the ones directly involved in this event.  I''m not saying she shouldn''t
  be at the hospital, or even come in to see her before the procedure begins - I''m
  fine with all of that.  But when it comes time for the main event so to speak, I
  feel it''s time for her to head to the waiting room.  I want this time alone with
  my wife to laugh, to cry, to enjoy our child privately before they become a spectacle
  for everyone else.


  I''ve learned quickly that pregnancy hormones are a very real thing, so I''m not
  entirely certain what to expect when this conversation happens again.  So I''m wondering
  AITA if I stick to my guns on this one, or am I better off taking one for the team,
  sucking it up and letting my MIL (in my opinion) ruin the moment.

  \*Edit: forgot to mention that barring any unforeseen circumstances she''ll be having
  a planned c-section, so unless the kid arrives unexpectedly we won''t be doing hours
  of labor, etc.'

  our 1st child is born?
