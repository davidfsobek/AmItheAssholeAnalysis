selftext: "Just for context, I am 6'2 and my wife is 4'11. She is insecure about her\
  \ height and while I try my best to tell her that she is stupendously beautiful\
  \ the way she is, she got bullied about it pretty bad and it's just an aspect she\
  \ doesn't like about herself.\n\nWith this in mind, we recently went to one of my\
  \ favorite places to eat. Now, this restaurant has a really large counter and my\
  \ wife is petite, so the cashier couldn't really see her. \nWe ordered our food,\
  \ and were heading out when the cashier held out a giant piece of candy and said\
  \ 'for your lovely daughter' to me.\n\nI honestly couldn't help but burst out laughing\
  \ to the point that I had tears in my eyes and I had to compose myself before driving\
  \ back home. \n\nMy wife was obviously pretty pissed. AITA?"
