selftext: 'Edit: Message received, I''m the controlling asshole. Thanks especially
  to those who talked about the element of writers wanting privacy from their friends
  more than from strangers, and those who talked about it not necessarily being a
  sex thing - I wasn''t really aware of those aspects. I''m dropping any attempt to
  try and find her work, apologizing a *lot*, and will work on my insecurity and our
  shared trust.

  We are both in our early 20s and have been together two years.


  A few years before we met, my girlfriend was very into erotic fanfiction and wrote
  some herself, along with plain romantic fanfiction. I was aware she used to write
  fanfiction but I thought it had been private. I know basic details, like the fandom
  and that it was apparently very kinky.


  Turns out it is still public, and she still occasionally gets comments on it. When
  checking her emails she noticed she had a new comment on a fanfiction from years
  ago, and happily told me about it. Apparently the person commenting thought it was
  really hot. I was shocked. I asked if I could read it, but she refused to let me.


  So on my own I started trying to find it, looking for other usernames I know she''s
  used in the past, and into the fandoms I know she was in, but I couldn''t find it.
  I told her I was doing this, and she said she was uncomfortable with me reading
  it. However, she is comfortable with total strangers reading it. I told her I was
  uncomfortable with total strangers getting their rocks off to something she''d made,
  and that she needed to delete it, or I''d keep going till I found it.


  She thinks I am an asshole, because she wrote them long before meeting me and is
  now embarrassed by them. (Not embarrassed enough to delete them though.)


  I think if anyone should get to see erotic stuff from my girlfriend, it should be
  me, not *literally anyone in the world except me*. I''m asking here to make sure
  I''m not being too controlling really. AITA?'
