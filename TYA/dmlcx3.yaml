selftext: "Longtime lurker here. Hoping some of you guys can weigh in on what has\
  \ become a really frustrating situation with a close friend and his partner.\n\n\
  So my wife (29F) and I (29M) have been hosting dinner parties a few times a year\
  \ for as long as we\u2019ve lived in our current city. We like to go all out and\
  \ cook elaborate multi-course meals, so we limit our invitations to just a few close\
  \ friends, since cooking such a complex dinner is an all-day affair and the food\
  \ costs add up quickly. We have about four to six people we invite to these events,\
  \ depending on their availability, and it\u2019s become a great tradition in our\
  \ social circle. \n\nOur friend James started dating his girlfriend Sarah about\
  \ a year and a half ago, and when we first extended her an invitation, we were informed\
  \ that Sarah was vegan. I thanked James for letting us know and said she was more\
  \ than welcome to bring her own food so she would have something to eat. He agreed,\
  \ and the two of them have been attending our parties regularly for the past year.\
  \ Everything was fine, until now.\n\nDuring our most recent dinner this past week,\
  \ we noticed that Sarah was very quiet and looked like she was about to cry. My\
  \ wife asked her what was wrong, but she told us not to worry about it and kept\
  \ dodging the question, so we didn\u2019t push the issue. \n\nHowever, after the\
  \ meal, James took us aside privately and told us that Sarah felt hurt because we\
  \ never provided any dishes she could eat at our dinners and it seemed like we were\
  \ deliberately excluding her. He added that he thought we were being rude and inconsiderate\
  \ by not accommodating her, which really pissed me off, and we got into a huge argument\
  \ over it. \n\nMy wife feels terrible that Sarah was so upset and apologized to\
  \ her and James profusely, but I don\u2019t agree that we did anything wrong. I\
  \ like Sarah very much as a person and I don\u2019t have anything against her dietary\
  \ choices, but I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s fair to expect us to change our entire\
  \ menu or make an entire separate meal for one person, especially when so much time\
  \ and effort goes into creating these dinners. For the record, nobody else has any\
  \ dietary restrictions. AITA?"
