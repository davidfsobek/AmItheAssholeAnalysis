selftext: "Someone I went to high school with happened to be in New York like 3 days\
  \ before 9/11 and stayed at an hotel near the World Trade Center. Every 9/11 he\
  \ makes a bullshit post on Facebook about his he feels survivors guilt and he\u2019\
  s thankful to be alive. I got sick of this shit so I called him out for it on Facebook\
  \ telling him to stop making this about him and to stop seeking attention and sympathy\
  \ on Facebook. Millions of people were in New York when this happened who were more\
  \ affected than he was. He\u2019s not special or unique and what he\u2019s doing\
  \ is pathetic. Most people supported me while others said I need to be more sympathetic.\n\
  \n\nWe\u2019re from Vermont, this guy happened to be in New York on vacation 3 days\
  \ before 9/11. Wasn\u2019t personally affected at all"
