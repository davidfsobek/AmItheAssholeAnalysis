selftext: "So this actually happened a few months ago, but I mentioned it to a friend\
  \ who said it was a real dick move. Since I've had some time to cool down from the\
  \ situation I'm worried she may be right. \n\nI'm a brown woman (23) working in\
  \ an especially white male dominated branch of engineering. I graduated a couple\
  \ years ago and landed a job at a small (15 people) firm, where I was the only POC.\
  \ While I have an engineering degree, the company required that all new graduates\
  \ start in a tech position. There was this guy, Drew (30), a full time tech (not\
  \ an engineer-he graduated with a two year degree from community college) and had\
  \ worked there for 3 years already. \n\nDrew made really racist and sexist remarks\
  \ constantly while I was there. In my first week, he left an article on my desk\
  \ about an indian father who flew into the US to beat his daughter. He loudly asked\
  \ me if my brother and dad take turns beating me, and if my husband would do the\
  \ same. He'd make comments about my chest size (\"I can't imagine someone breaking\
  \ up with a girl who's got a rack like that\" -Drew, to me, at the Christmas party).\
  \ He tried to show up to my house randomly once, but neighborhood security would\
  \ not let him in. \n\nI made lots of complaints against him, but the owners really\
  \ loved him for some reason. They paid him around $10k more than me a year, even\
  \ though I graduated from one of the top engineering schools in the country and\
  \ he didn't have an engineering degree (this is something I found out because he\
  \ came and bragged to me about it. I asked the owners why he made so much more,\
  \ and they said it was seniority). \n\nWithin the first 3 months I had surpassed\
  \ him in drafting and had to help him all the time. He would stop trying on difficult\
  \ work because he knew I would fix it. He would harass me during these times and\
  \ I couldn't focus on my own work because I was always helping him. So I went to\
  \ management and asked if they would let me make training documents instead to limit\
  \ my interaction with him. They agreed, so I ended up making a manual around 200\
  \ pages long for him to reference. He'd always complain that it was too hard for\
  \ him to understand, though. However, the company really valued it and would use\
  \ it to train new employees. \n\nAnyway, I landed a new job and put in my two weeks.\
  \ I refused to train Drew during this time. On my last day, I deleted my manual\
  \ from the servers in a way that it could not be recovered (I handled the office\
  \ IT as well). \n\nI've gotten calls from the company asking about it, and I said\
  \ I didn't know what happened and that it's on them. I know they're really struggling\
  \ to train their new employees on these workflows that I've developed because Drew\
  \ never learned them properly and they now have no reference. My friend said it\
  \ was a real dick move of me because they had paid me to develop that, and the new\
  \ employees who have never done me wrong are the ones suffering. I just didn't want\
  \ Drew or the company to benefit from it after their treatment of me, but now I'm\
  \ not so sure. \n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: There are a lot of people concerned for my professional\
  \ references from this company. I just wanted to say that the actual owner/founder\
  \ (whose name carries a ton of weight in my industry) loves me and has given me\
  \ great recommendations. I work with him a lot still and we have a great relationship.\
  \ He's *very* old fashioned and would not get involved in \"office drama\" (what\
  \ he calls anything having to do with HR). As for legal repercussions, this company\
  \ has a history of shady business practices that would make it difficult for them\
  \ to pursue anything against me. I have consulted a lawyer with far more information\
  \ than what is included in this post.\n\nAnother Edit: A couple things worth addressing\
  \ considering the attention this post has received. \n\n1. I did not mean to imply\
  \ that I was better than Drew because of his degree compared to mine. His degree\
  \ does not help him in his role, and his contributions in his 3 years at the company\
  \ were pretty minimal. This is why I mentioned it, to point out that neither his\
  \ degree nor contributions to the company justify his higher salary. I also am able\
  \ to make design decisions as a drafter, which is something he refuses to learn\
  \ how to do. He did the bare minimum. There's  reason it only took me a few months\
  \ to surpass him. \n\n2. When the company reached out to me about the manual after\
  \ I quit, they never accused me of deleting it. They reached out asking if I had\
  \ a version saved somewhere because they had lost access to theirs. They've been\
  \ having server issues causing files to revert back to previous versions on several\
  \ files, not just this one. They're still having server issues. I have theories\
  \ on this, but I'll put away my tin foil hat for now.\n\n3. When I said not recoverable,\
  \ I meant by the people at the company. Of course if they ever decided to hire an\
  \ IT company (or some sort of computer company? Idk much about all that) to fix\
  \ their server issue and restore files, they'd probably pretty easily be able to\
  \ recover this doc. When we first started having these server issues I tried to\
  \ convince ownership to contact someone who could help because it was beyond anything\
  \ I could figure out. They were fine with using our workarounds instead. The company\
  \ I worked for is NOT an IT company. It was a tiny engineering firm. Anyone with\
  \ a background in environmental, civil, agricultural, etc can attest to the fact\
  \ that there are plenty of engineers in the field without a strong computer background."
