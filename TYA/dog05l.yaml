selftext: "I am a high school teacher. At my school, we accept late work without docking\
  \ points, and we don\u2019t grade on things like participation.\n\nI do not assign\
  \ homework. The work students do for me is done in class, because I generally don\u2019\
  t believe in adding to students\u2019 schedules. \n\nThis student, Alex, was given\
  \ bountiful time to read and write various essays in class. \n\nThe issue began\
  \ when Alex missed an essay we wrote. I allowed her to come to my study hall to\
  \ write it with my help. This was about 5 weeks ago. She did not write it. When\
  \ I asked her if I could help, she would ask questions that made it evident she\
  \ had not even begun to read.\nExample: \u201Cwait, is Gatsby the narrator?\u201D\
  \n\nShe is fully able to to read and has demonstrated so.\n\nLast week I began reminding\
  \ students that the last day I would accept late or missing work was Friday. Alex\
  \ now had two essays she hadn\u2019t written. The second essay was based on readings\
  \ of the students\u2019 choice. She had not done any reading, and so had nothing\
  \ to write about. \n\nWhen I informed her that she would need to read at least three\
  \ short stories to write the paper, she said \u201CI\u2019ve never had to read to\
  \ pass an English class before.\u201D \n\nIf a student doesn\u2019t complete the\
  \ essays, the class is marked incomplete and they must retake it. She knew this,\
  \ so she spent the entire day Friday writing both essays. \n\nInstead of doing what\
  \ the rest of the class was doing, Alex spent the hour typing her essay. I repeatedly\
  \ told her not to, and she replied with \u201CI\u2019m writing my essay though.\u201D\
  \ She had been given over a month to write these papers, including extensive in-class\
  \ time before they were actually due. \n\nAnother teacher mentioned to me that she\
  \ spent the entire period in his class on Friday typing her essay for me, even though\
  \ she had missing work for him and he asked her to focus on his class, not mine.\
  \ She refused.\n\nFinally, at the end of the day Friday she turned both essays in\
  \ and said \u201CI\u2019ve been around the block a few times, I know how to not\
  \ do any work and still pass the class.\u201D She then pranced out the door, shouting\
  \ \u201Cyay, I\u2019m not going to fail!\u201D\n\nThe point system at my school\
  \ works in such a way that when I put the grades in for those essays, regardless\
  \ of quality, she will pass my class with a D. \n\nHowever, she hasn\u2019t learned\
  \ anything from the class. She didn\u2019t do the required reading, and she repeatedly\
  \ refused to do what other students were doing throughout.\n\nI talked to administration\
  \ and was told that if she fails my class no one will fight me on it. \n\nPoints-wise,\
  \ she passes, but I feel like allowing her to pass when I know she didn\u2019t do\
  \ any work whatsoever, and ignored work in other classes to scrape through last\
  \ minute, would be sending the wrong message about how to succeed in the world.\
  \ \n\nShould I just pass her and be done with it, or WIBTA if I failed her?\n\n\
  EDIT: I would definitely BTA. I was having a moment grading her terrible essays.\
  \ But I absolutely can\u2019t take my frustration with the policy out on her when\
  \ I didn\u2019t provide any consequences beforehand or modify my own rules to follow."
