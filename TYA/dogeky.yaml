selftext: "My wife (29) and I (32) share cooking responsibilities about 50/50. We\
  \ are childless so we just cook for ourselves. \n\nWe have a system where we try\
  \ to plan out our dinners a few days in advance. We both work full time and get\
  \ off around 4:30, so it\u2019s important for us to know what we want. \n\nLate\
  \ last week I had gotten somewhat sick with a stomach virus and was still recovering.\
  \ However, the day I got really nauseated I ate a salad with a small burger and\
  \ threw everything up. You know when you eat something while nauseous and throw\
  \ it up, you kind of turn against it? Well that\u2019s what happened.\n\nSo I warned\
  \ my wife on Saturday: this week I want no salad or burgers. She said ok. Today\
  \ we get home from work, I ask what we are eating since we both were indecisive.\
  \ She said she didn\u2019t know but would get it started. I told her I would go\
  \ take a shower and would be down. \n\nAs soon as I exit the shower, I smell meat\
  \ cooking. I go down and she literally made hamburgers. I told her \u201Chey, I\
  \ thought we agreed no burgers for awhile after I got sick?\u201D She replied \u201C\
  well there isn\u2019t anything else to eat, so this is what we are having. Besides\
  \ you aren\u2019t sick anymore\u201D. \n\nI sat in stunned silence for the remainder\
  \ of the cooking and when she gave me the plate, I got up and threw it in the garbage\
  \ and we got into a spat. I then yelled \u201Cyou did the exact f*cking opposite\
  \ of what I said not to do\u201D and I kicked the trash can and then told her I\
  \ was leaving to go out to eat. I then slammed the door and sped off. \n\nShe texted\
  \ me calling me rude. I ignored her and enjoyed my meal outside. Was I an asshole\
  \ for doing this?"

  \ told her I didn\u2019t want it?"
