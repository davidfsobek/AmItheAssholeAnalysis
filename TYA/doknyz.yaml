selftext: 'So I started out in a commission only job for a small commercial real estate
  firm a could years ago.  About 3 days into the job the person in their Accounts
  Payable/Accounts Receivable position went to lunch and never came back.  They offered
  me the job, they lowballed the pay but hey it was better than working nights at
  Walmart so I took it as it fit my experience.  I was tasked with putting together
  a manual for the position, now this struck me as odd since the only person that
  would perform the duties of the job was the controller who had been there for years.  I
  dragged my feet putting it together but fast forward about a year and I could sense
  some major bad vibes from the controller.  She didn''t like me, I tried to be cordial
  but quite frankly she was a horrible manager.  The owner called me into his office
  one day to review my position, said I was doing a great job but he really wanted
  me to finish that manual and make sure my email was well organized (major red flag).  I
  put together the best manual they''ve seen (nobody in the office knew dick about
  Microsoft office), put it on the company network and let the boss know it was ready.  The
  next day he called me into his office telling me I''m always too late (I had been
  one minute late 3 times in the last 6 months) so I smelled something fishy.  I locked
  the manual with a relatively simple password and the next day made sure I was in
  on time the next day.  After lunch I got called into the office and told I was late
  so I could resign or be fired.  I walked, they called me two weeks later asking
  for the password, I told them they were a bit late on their request.  AITA?


  EDIT: thank you for the lively discussion!  To clear up a few points I was not solely
  tasked with writing the manual, I did the job and wrote it as time was available.  I
  also finished a number of other projects aside from the manual, took about a year
  because that''s the amount of time you''d need to fully grasp all aspects of the
  position (in the financial world there are a periodic processes you don''t do every
  day/week/month)'
