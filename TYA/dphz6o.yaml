selftext: "My college has an annual event where local kids can safely trick or treat\
  \ in the dorms the day before Halloween. The students are required to buy their\
  \ own candy and have to pray they don\u2019t run out before the event is over, which\
  \ happened to me last year.\n\nSo tonight was this event and I was pretty strict\
  \ with the \u201Cone candy per kid\u201D rule, but I was really uncomfortable when\
  \ a parent would approach the door with a baby (and I mean less than 1-2 years old)\
  \ and expect me to give them candy on their behalf. This happened with parents who\
  \ had other, more appropriately aged kids with them too, which was I guess more\
  \ understandable. But mainly it happened with parents who had nobody else but the\
  \ baby- they would just show up to my door holding a costumed baby and a bag and\
  \ said \u201Csay trick or treat!\u201D as if they deserve something for that.\n\n\
  After this happening more than a few times, I decided to put my foot down and deny\
  \ candy to kids who weren\u2019t old enough (can\u2019t walk, can\u2019t hold their\
  \ own bag, doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on). From that point on I said to\
  \ everyone else that night: \u201CWe have limited candy and want to make sure the\
  \ \u2018big\u2019 kids get some.\u201D\n\nI wound up getting some criticism from\
  \ a few parents, some made shocked or disgusted faces and one couple even said they\
  \ wanted to complain to the resident manager of my building, who is 100% on my side\
  \ on this.\n\nAm I the asshole for thinking that it\u2019s wrong for parents to\
  \ use their baby, who is too young to remember their first or second Halloween,\
  \ to get free candy for themselves by trick or treating?\n\n**EDIT: I\u2019m definitely\
  \ NOT against giving candy to teenagers. Hell, I\u2019ve even seen a few of my fellow\
  \ students trick or treating at this event! And I\u2019m most definitely not bashing\
  \ new parents for showing off their kid\u2019s cute costume. My problem solely lies\
  \ with parents taking advantage of us and using their costumed baby to get candy\
  \ for themselves and then getting angry with me because I\u2019m refusing to \u201C\
  give their kid\u201D any candy."
