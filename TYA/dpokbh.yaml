selftext: "My girlfriend (22f) and I (23m) have been dating for 8 months. Around 4\
  \ months before I met her, my sister announced she is having a destination wedding.\
  \ Being that I was single, I asked my friend (22f) if she wanted to go with me.\
  \ There has never been anything romantic between us and that is one of the things\
  \ we value about our friendship. I promised her that even if I got into a relationship,\
  \ we would still go because I think it would be shitty of me to take that away from\
  \ a long standing friend and give it to a relatively newer girlfriend. After a few\
  \ months, we both ended up in happy and supportive relationships. As it turns out,\
  \ my friend and gf went to the same high school together, but did not interact much\
  \ as they were very different people back then. To give some perspective on the\
  \ gf, she is someone who goes far out of her way to accommodate others and make\
  \ people feel comfortable, putting her own happiness second to those around her.\
  \ We are both great communicators and are always able to talk through our problems.\
  \ I brought up the destination wedding trip and details early on in the relationship\
  \ so it wouldn't be a surprise, and it didn't seem to be an issue initially. Over\
  \ time, her friends (who I believe were only looking out for her) expressed concern\
  \ that I was going to a romantic destination wedding with someone that is not her,\
  \ and that they think it is inappropriate. When she met my family, they brought\
  \ up the wedding on multiple separate occasions forgetting that she was not going,\
  \ and when we reminded them of this, she was met with \"oh we wish you were going.\"\
  \ Reasonably, these things got to her and built up to her being adamantly against\
  \ the concept of the trip. By this I mean that she never asked me not to go, and\
  \ she never asked me to let her go instead of my friend, but she said that she does\
  \ not want contact with me while I am gone, and does not want to hear about the\
  \ trip. She has stated that when I return, if she can forget it ever happened and\
  \ move on, then we will be fine, but if she can't get past it, then our relationship\
  \ is likely over. I feel like I am doing the right thing by keeping my promise,\
  \ but she feels like the right thing would have been for me to realize months ago\
  \ that this is inappropriate and to take her instead (even though she did not ask\
  \ me to do that). AITA? \n\nEDIT: There is no time to change plans. The flight is\
  \ tomorrow morning and there are no more rooms in the resort. GF has no passport,\
  \ so this is impossible at this point.\n\nUPDATE: For those of you saying \"You\
  \ probably won't have a girlfriend when you get back\" and \"Waiting for the edit\
  \ saying your GF broke up with you\" prepare to be disappointed. The wedding was\
  \ a lot of fun, and we talked every day. She had a good weekend visiting a sibling\
  \ and we hung out when I got back. She made me brownies and I gave her some rum\
  \ cakes from the trip and we caught up and joked around. We are already planning\
  \ a getaway trip for her birthday with just the two of us, so things are really\
  \ looking up. Every relationship has bumps and mistakes; not everything has to be\
  \ a deal breaker."
