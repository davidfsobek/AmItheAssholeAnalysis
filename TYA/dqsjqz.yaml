selftext: "I'm M28 and my GF is F27 and we've been together for about 2 years living\
  \ together for the past 6 months. I moved out of my condo about 6 months ago (that\
  \ I own) and into my GF's place since her roommate was leaving and we agreed to\
  \ split the rent and utils 50/50. I'm trending to make \\~250k this year and she\
  \ makes about 60k. She can easily afford our rent and utils but recently came to\
  \ me asking me to pay more of the rent and utils as I make a lot more or for me\
  \ to pick up the tab on date night more often. We usually split date night or she'll\
  \ pay for a few then I'll pay for a few. I told her no, a 50/50 split is fair on\
  \ rent and utils and groceries and I told her I'd pick up the tab on date nights\
  \ a little more but thats it. She called me an asshole and her sister later messaged\
  \ me saying I wasn't being a \"man\". \n\nAITA?"
