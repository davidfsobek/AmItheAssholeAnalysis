selftext: "The title sounds absolutely terrible.\n \nMy wife and I are high school\
  \ sweethearts. We started dating the junior year of high school. We broke up when\
  \ we went back to college, but we made a pact that if we were single and once we\
  \ finished college, that we\u2019d date again. I hooked up with a couple women throughout\
  \ college. No long relationships, but I did have sex. My wife was \u201Csaving herself\u201D\
  \ for me. \n \nI didn\u2019t tell her about the hookups because I thought that wasn\u2019\
  t relevant to our relationship and that it would make unnecessary struggle. But\
  \ alas, lies don\u2019t last forever. Someone recognized me as their ex, and we\
  \ began to talk. She introduced herself as my ex, and my wife was pretty mad at\
  \ me for not telling about what I did. I\u2019m arguing that we weren\u2019t in\
  \ a relationship while we were broken up. She said that having sex with other people\
  \ is pretty important to tell her.\n \nWe have 8 year old twins. And this is causing\
  \ some friction between us. If AITA then I will apologize. If I\u2019m not, then\
  \ I\u2019ll probably still apologize. \n \nSo, AITA?"
