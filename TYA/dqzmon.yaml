selftext: 'I (26M) and roommates with (30M). Let''s call him Mark. Mark told me that
  he is considering to buy ticketed to a porn convention and my first reaction was
  to laugh. He asked why I laughed so I just explained.


  I said that I can understand people who are in the industry who go, so men/women
  looking to further their career. But the dudes who go as fans that aren''t in the
  industry are just weirdos and losers. I''ve seen videos/pics and they look just
  as you''d expect them to.


  I think it''s a bizzare and sad thing to actually be fans of pornstars to the extent
  to visit them at conventions..

  Well Mark called me asshole but tbh I don''t see how I''m wrong. I asked other people
  and they agreed that people who go to these cons are weird and creepy. AITA?


  **Edit - I ain''t wrong Pete.**'
