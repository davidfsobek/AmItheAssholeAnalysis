selftext: "My little sister Olivia is 17 and is currently battling cancer. As a result,\
  \ every birthday that she has is a blessing to our family and we celebrate it. \n\
  \nMy older brother Adam has always been super close to Olivia and is protective\
  \ of her. Her and I are also close, as one of Olivia\u2019s older brothers, but\
  \ I\u2019m less close with Adam. \n\nI\u2019ve suffered from substance abuse issues\
  \ for the past few years. As of right now, I\u2019m a month clean. \n\nOlivia\u2019\
  s 17th birthday was this past weekend. I knew that my family was putting together\
  \ a small party for her.  I got a call from Adam last Thursday that said I wasn\u2019\
  t \u201Cwelcome\u201D to Olivia\u2019s party because I\u2019m not trusted enough\
  \ to not steal her pain killers, or to ruin the party.  He said that I also haven\u2019\
  t been sober long enough to earn that trust. \n\nI told him that if he doesn\u2019\
  t trust me not to steal my little sister\u2019s pain killers, then he doesn\u2019\
  t need to be around me at all. He said that if I showed up, then there would be\
  \ problems. \n\nThe thing is, there\u2019s no way I was gonna miss one of Olivia\u2019\
  s birthdays. Every birthday is a gift, and I\u2019m not going to miss it for anything,\
  \ despite what Adam days.\n\nSo yesterday on Saturday, I made my way to my parent\u2019\
  s house for Olivia\u2019s party. I walked in and immediately saw on Adam\u2019s\
  \ face that he wasn\u2019t happy. I ended up just ignoring him and going to say\
  \ hi to Olivia. She was excited to see me and gave me a huge hug.\n\nAt one point,\
  \ I went upstairs to pee and on my way back down the stairs, my brother asked me\
  \ to turn out my pockets. I did, just so he could look like an idiot. He told me\
  \ that it was \u201Cfor my own good and because he loved me.\u201D\n\nOlivia got\
  \ tired not long after this so we all headed out. My parents stopped me as I was\
  \ leaving and told me that while they are happy that I \u201Cseem to be doing well\u201D\
  \ but that they wished I would have talked to Adam before just showing up as it\
  \ caused tension over the evening. \n\nI told them that he had no right to ban me\
  \ from seeing Olivia and that she was happy to see me. They then said that they\
  \ understood but to just be more accountable next time. I then just left. \n\nI\
  \ really don\u2019t think that I was out of line. Olivia was happy to see me and\
  \ I suspect that Adam didn\u2019t talk to her about not inviting me. I was never\
  \ once tempted to steal my sister\u2019s pain killers. But I know the pain I\u2019\
  ve caused my family, so I don\u2019t know. \n\nI am looking for some outside perspective\
  \ on whether what I did was truly assholish or not. \n\nThat being said, AITA?"

  \ that I was going to steal her pain medication?"
