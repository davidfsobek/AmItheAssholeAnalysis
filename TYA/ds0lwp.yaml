selftext: "\nI was kind of awkward back in high school. I was chubby, with long emo\
  \ style hair, quiet, talked funny and didn\u2019t have too many friends. I was a\
  \ kind of a target for bullies, both guys and girls. One of the girls, let\u2019\
  s call her J was kind of mean to me in a weird kind of way. She would pick on on\
  \ me when others were around and when it was just us 2 (which was often because\
  \ we both got to school early) she would kind of make fun of me in a condescending\
  \ way while pretending to be nice. I can\u2019t really explain it but I could always\
  \ tell she was mocking me. The most embarrassing thing she ever did to me was walk\
  \ up to me and say \u201Cif you let me touch your tits I\u2019ll let you touch mine\u201D\
  \ in front of a bunch of people. Being awkward of course I put my head down and\
  \ said no. Everyone laughed. I\u2019ve never forgotten that moment.\n\nAnyways that\
  \ was all over a decade ago. Nowadays I\u2019m more confident and happy, I\u2019\
  ve lost weight, I look good and feel good. I have a good job and hobbies that make\
  \ me happy and feel fulfilled. I am successful and close to having my dream career.\
  \ I have gotten on Instagram recently, and been posting about my life. I have been\
  \ getting a lot of old classmates following me. One of which was J. She\u2019s still\
  \ good looking, she has a kid and is a single mother. She commented on one of my\
  \ pictures, we chatted and that eventually led to DMing. I won\u2019t bore you with\
  \ details but a couple of weeks later we hung out, and I slept with her. The entire\
  \ time we talked though I couldn\u2019t stop remembering how she teased me in high\
  \ school and how I went home and cried. \n\nwe went out a few more times and I slept\
  \ with her a few more times. I don\u2019t know why but I started feeling more and\
  \ more jaded each time I saw her. One night we were hanging out and I had this rage\
  \ building in me, even though she had already apologized. That night we were at\
  \ a bar watching a game and I excused myself to the bathroom but just left. She\
  \ called me but I ignored her. I was already a bit drunk but I got home and drank\
  \ a lot of tequila and I felt like I had to get it off my chest, I made a post on\
  \ Instagram, saying something to the effect of \u201Cyou laughed at me in high school,\
  \ who\u2019s laughing now?! Hit it and quit it\u201D then I tagged her. \n\nShe\
  \ responded with \u201Cwtf\u201D then blocked me, a few other people we went to\
  \ school with also unfollowed me. A bunch of other people all commented asking me\
  \ what happened and what was wrong with me. Then one comment really hit me, someone\
  \ commented saying \u201CI don\u2019t know the story, but I don\u2019t know that\
  \ you\u2019re no where near as happy as your posts suggest, I feel sorry for you\u201D\
  \n\nAfter that I deleted my entire account and lost all my likes and followers but\
  \ I felt embarrassed. Was I an asshole here? I felt anger every time we had fun\
  \ together because all I could think of was teenage me hurting because of her. I\
  \ don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019ve thought of calling her and seeing if I could\
  \ apologize see if I could take her out to make up for it. Idk you guys tell me."
title: AITA for calling out a high school bully almost a decade later and after we
  had been on a few dates together?
