selftext: 'My son went a few states over for college this year. I get it - he doesn''t
  want to check in with Dad every day and wants to do his own thing. My issue is that
  I am paying for him to do his "thing" and want to know what''s going on. I am not
  pushy. It''s like he ghosted me. My ex is not helpful because she will just send
  him whatever he wants, no questions asked. She''s broke though so the only time
  he responds or contacts me is when he has no one else to ask. I got tired of it
  so I cut him off financially. Now he''s in a bind because he was counting on money
  coming that ain''t coming. I''ve done more for that brat that his mom and I feel
  the best way to teach him a lesson is to struggle. Also, I want this to be an example
  to his younger brothers.

  Edit: The money he was counting on was for a Thanksgiving flight back home. I took
  that off the (Thanksgiving) table so now he''s either can fly home or not eat until
  December.

  Edit: I hear from him no more than once a week and most of it is his asking for
  money. And I am the one calling. He calls his mom and games with his younger brothers.
  That bastard called me up today to ask me about buying a safe and I missed his call.
  I called him back three times and not once did he pick up. Dude, you are not that
  fucking busy.'
