selftext: "I'm asking this for both myself and my husband.\n\nI used to work for the\
  \ private school in question. One of the perks was heavily discounted tuition for\
  \ my kids. So both of my older sons went to the school and have graduated.\n\nLast\
  \ year, I got a new job in a different school. It's a very good state school. It\
  \ was an incredibly good career jump for me. My husband works remotely so he had\
  \ no issues moving. My son was just about to start his final year of highschool\
  \ but after much thinking and getting his input, we ended up moving because I don't\
  \ think I'd ever get a career opportunity like that again.\n\nEverything was going\
  \ well until it was time for college applications.\n\nWe were very surprised to\
  \ hear that my son wanted to go to the same private school as his brothers. The\
  \ out of state tuition for that school without my discount is absolutely unaffordable\
  \ for us. Especially with some recent medical bills we had.\n\nHe then proceeded\
  \ to list another private school in our state but again, we cannot afford that kind\
  \ of tuition. \n\nWe were never the kind of family that put emphasis on ivy league\
  \ schools. And our son was never vocal about going to private schools either. Both\
  \ my husband and I went to state schools.\n\nI told him the school I work for is\
  \ excellent and we'd save a lot of money with my benefits.\n\nThis conversation\
  \ ended very poorly. He said he would have never agreed to the move if we'd told\
  \ him this would happen. This was a mistake on our part I must admit.\n\nOur son\
  \ went ahead and applied to the private school anyway and got accepted. But my husband\
  \ and I were firm that we would not be cosigning any student loans. We are not in\
  \ a place to do that.\n\nHe's made accusations of favoritism which I refuse to accept.\
  \ Our kids went to schools based on what we could afford at the time.\n\nOur son\
  \ ended up going to the school I work at and is doing very poorly. He hates the\
  \ school and has generally stopped talking to my husband and I. His brothers have\
  \ tried talking to him and he's just lashed out at them, accusing then of using\
  \ all of our funds. That's created a whole other conflict.\n\nMy husband got told\
  \ by our son that he might be failing some midterms. It's extremely disappointing\
  \ because our youngest has always been the most academically gifted.\n\nNow we're\
  \ wondering if we stunted his potential. We will likely pull him out for a semester\
  \ and get him in counseling. He's been very angry at us and regularly accuses us\
  \ of ruining his life. I've cried a lot over it. \n\nWere we the assholes?"
