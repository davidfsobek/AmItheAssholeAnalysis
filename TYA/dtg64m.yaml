selftext: "Throw away because I don\u2019t want Reddit to know that I\u2019m Mormon.\
  \ \nSome background information is relevant here. \nMy first wife and I got married\
  \ way too young. We both grew up Mormon, but she soon started having doubts and\
  \ left the religion. Even though we were only married for two years we have a daughter\
  \ together. She ended up leaving the church, I stayed. I have primary custody of\
  \   my daughter. She only goes to my wife Friday-Sunday every other weekend. Her\
  \ mother is an artist, so she\u2019s a lot less stable income wise, and lives in\
  \ a studio apartment. \nI am remarried and have two other children with my current\
  \ wife. \n\nDaughter is 14 and beginning to be a bit rebellious. I get it. Since\
  \ she stays with us however, she is required to go to church, and she must look\
  \ presentable. \nA while ago, when she went to stay with my ex she allowed her to\
  \ get what is called a bar piercing in her ear. My daughter already has two lobe\
  \ piercings in each ear. I don\u2019t like it, but I chose to pick my battles and\
  \ not say anything about it. After the bar piercing I told my ex that she had to\
  \ consult me if she was going to alter my daughter\u2019s appearance in any way\
  \ from now on. I let her keep the bar piercing in her ear as long as she covers\
  \ it with her hair while at church. \nLately my daughter has been wanting to dye\
  \ her hair. I have told her that she\u2019s not allowed to. She can color her hair\
  \ when she is no longer under my roof. \nWell this weekend she want to my ex\u2019\
  s, and guess what she comes back with? Bright blue hair! The hair is not completely\
  \ blue, a good four inches of it is blue at the bottom. I am pissed.\nI demand her\
  \ mother to give me money to take her to a salon to dye it back to a natural color.\
  \ We go to the salon, and they try to dye the hair back to a normal color but it\
  \ comes out a mucky green color. \nI tell the stylist to cut it off, into a pixie\
  \ style. My daughters hair is already short, a bit longer than chin length, and\
  \ she has had short hair before. But now since her ears will be showing at church,\
  \ the bar piercing needs to come out as well. \nMy daughter is refusing to speak\
  \ to me and is very upset, and my ex-wife is threatening to take me to court. \n\
  I thought that I handled this appropriately but now I\u2019m staring to doubt what\
  \ I did. \nAITA?"
