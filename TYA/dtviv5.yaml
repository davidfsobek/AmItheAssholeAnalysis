selftext: "My family comes from a middle class background, but my younger sister Nicky\
  \ married into old money and now lives a very comfortable lifestyle. She and her\
  \ husband Joel don\u2019t have children yet, and they love to spoil my kids, who\
  \ are 6 and 4. \n\nMy problem is, every time Nicky and Joel buy my kids gifts or\
  \ takes us on vacation, Nicky tells them that they should study hard and get straight\
  \ A\u2019s in school so that they\u2019ll have a lot of money to buy the things\
  \ they want when they grow up. \n\nI don\u2019t want my kids to feel pressured to\
  \ excel academically, because that\u2019s what my parents did with me and Nicky\
  \ and I hated it. I also don\u2019t want them to grow up materialistic or think\
  \ that money is the most important thing. \n\nThe tipping point for me was when\
  \ my husband Ben and I were looking at TV\u2019s online and I made a comment about\
  \ how I like a certain model but it\u2019s too expensive. My son said something\
  \ along the lines of \u201CWhy don\u2019t have you have the money to buy the TV\
  \ you like? Didn\u2019t you get good grades when you were in school?\u201D, which\
  \ is definitely something I don\u2019t want him to say to other people.  \n\nThe\
  \ next time Nicky had gifts for my kids, I took her aside and said that while I\u2019\
  m very grateful that she and Joel are so generous to us, I want her to stop telling\
  \ my kids that they should get straight A\u2019s so they\u2019ll have money when\
  \ they grow up. \n\nNicky was surprised. I explained my reasons, and she replied\
  \ that she just wants my kids to be happy that\u2019s why she buys them gifts, and\
  \ she wants to encourage them to do well in school at the same time. She said that\
  \ I get the final say about my children so she won\u2019t say that anymore, but\
  \ she doesn\u2019t understand why I think it\u2019s wrong to say that since our\
  \ parents said that to us too when we were younger. \n\nI told her that our parents\
  \ saying that made me miserable because I felt pressured to get good grades. She\
  \ said that I might not have liked being told that then, but it was for our own\
  \ good and because of it we are now in a good place financially. \n\nAt that point\
  \ I felt that she was being passive aggressive, because she knows I didn\u2019t\
  \ do as well as she did academically and I\u2019m not yet in a good place financially.\
  \ So I asked her if it was really straight A\u2019s that got us there because for\
  \ me it\u2019s my work that puts food on the table and not my grades, and she and\
  \ Joel don\u2019t even use their degrees because Joel\u2019s trust funds cover everything.\
  \ \n\nBen said that I went too far by bringing up Joel and Nicky\u2019s finances\
  \ and making it seem like Nicky wouldn't have money if it weren't for Joel. My best\
  \ friend Kim says it\u2019s fair game because it was a fact that I just pointed\
  \ out, and as Nicky said herself, I get the final say about my children so she should\
  \ have left it at that and not asked me to justify myself. \n\nThoughts?"

  \ A\u2019s in school so they\u2019ll have a lot of money when they grow up, especially\
  \ since she herself has money mainly because she married a rich guy?"
