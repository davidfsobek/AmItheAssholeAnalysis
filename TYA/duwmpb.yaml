selftext: 'So I recently became debt free after moving in with my girlfriend, greatest
  feeling ever. She; however, is no where near debt free (20k+ in CC debt and a car
  that is worth only about 5k). Every time that I bring up that she needs to get on
  a budget and make a plan, she gets really defensive and hopeless saying that she
  is just going to accept it. Last week I told her that we should stop eating out
  and save our money so that she could work on paying off her debt. She agreed.

  Well yesterday, I went out for some beers with my friend and we watched the football
  game. I asked my girlfriend and our roommates if they had ever been to that place
  before. My roommates answered but then my girlfriend went into the chat and started
  saying, "Oh you can go out with your boys, but if I want you to take me out then
  it''s ''No we have to save money''?" and she went off on me and she aired our dirty
  laundry (regarding finances) in the household chat.

  Airing dirty laundry is 100% unacceptable to me. I told her that I said what I said
  because she HATES when I tell her that I am debt free and she thinks I throw it
  in her face. So I just lumped myself in there and said we should both work on not
  spending money. I also told her that if she aired our dirty laundry like that again
  then I would break up with her because that''s unacceptable to me.

  Am I the asshole? Am I being too hard on her? I don''t think so. I call it tough
  love.'
