selftext: "My brother\u2019s Will\u2019s wife April recently passed away from cancer.\
  \  He has a seven year old daughter, Lacey. The thing is, there is a strong possibility\
  \ that Lacey is actually my daughter. \n\nApril had an affair with me shortly after\
  \ they had gotten married. I\u2019m not debating the assholeness of us having an\
  \ affair. I know that I\u2019m a huge asshole in that regard. After we slept together,\
  \ she got pregnant. \n\nWe had a mutual agreement that we were never going to tell\
  \ Will what happened as it would devastate him. \n\nAs Lacey grew up, she began\
  \ to look more and more like me. I don\u2019t think Will ever clued in. April and\
  \ I talked about it a few times and she said that just based on the timeline of\
  \ when we slept together, there is a decent chance that Lacey is mine. \n\nWhen\
  \ April got cancer, Will was obviously devastated. Near the end of her illness,\
  \ April told me that eventually she would like Will and Lacey to know what happened\
  \ between us. She made me promise to tell them. I promised her that I would just\
  \ to give her some peace.\n\nShe passed away last month. I still have not told Will\
  \ and I don\u2019t think I ever will. He has been hyper depressed since April died\
  \ and telling him this would just devastate him, let alone ruin our relationship.\n\
  \nFor all practical reasons, Lacey is his daughter. He is the one that has raised\
  \ her and neither of them know any different. Especially since April died, I think\
  \ it would just be cruel to tell him that his daughter might not even be his daughter.\
  \ \n\nOn the other hand, I did promise April that I would tell him, and if she is\
  \ actually my daughter, I don\u2019t know if it would be better for that to be out\
  \ in the open or not. \n\nAgain, I\u2019m not debating the assholeness of the affair.\
  \ That\u2019s not the question here. \n\nAITA for not telling my brother?"
