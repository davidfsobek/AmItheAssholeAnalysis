selftext: "Not exactly NSFW, but here it goes. \n \nMy friend, let\u2019s call her\
  \ Sharen. Sharen got an unsolicited dick pic. Then she proceeded to share it with\
  \ everyone with his name. I have never given anyone a dick pic, other than my wife,\
  \ but I still feel sorry for the guy. Sure, he did something extremely disgusting,\
  \ but I think what Sharen did was equally as bad. \n \nSharen asked me how funny\
  \ what she did was. I responded honestly \u201CI think he\u2019s a prick for sharing\
  \ it unsolicited, but I think you\u2019re equally as bad for sharing his nudes,\
  \ plus you also sent an unsolicited dick pic\u201D. She then proceeded to call me\
  \ an asshole for siding with a person who shared a dick pic.\n \nSo, AITA?"
