selftext: "I (36M) have been with my wife for 16 years, we\u2019ve got three children\
  \ together who are 10, 3 years old (in a little under 6 weeks) and a 7 month old\n\
  \nWhen I was really young my mother met my father, he had a daughter who was 6 years\
  \ older than I am but despite this we grew up extremely close.\n\nMy sister passed\
  \ away on her 21st  birthday, I\u2019ve told my wife this but haven\u2019t gotten\
  \ into much detail about it nor have I shown her pictures \n\nAnyway my wife stumbled\
  \ upon the pictures I had of my sister, she assumed the worst and just tore them\
  \ all up, without asking who the woman in the pictures was.\n\nShe claimed she was\
  \ hormonal from the baby (she is *not* pregnant she gave birth 7 months ago)\n\n\
  \nI struggled to find words through the anger I felt and just asked her to leave,\
  \ she did (not without blaming me \u201Chad you told me I wouldn\u2019t have!\u201D\
  \ Etc)\n\n\nI\u2019ve been receiving texts from her friends all calling me TA for\
  \ overreacting since I have copies of the photos on my pc \n\nAITA?"
