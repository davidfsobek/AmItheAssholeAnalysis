selftext: " I work in a rather nice office, so some of the higher ups make very good\
  \ money. This colleague does not work in my department, so he is not my boss, but\
  \ he is definitely much higher up than I am. \n\nWe were recently seated at the\
  \ same table for a work related dinner event in which families were invited. He\
  \ brought his wife and his adult daughter and son, and I brought my husband. I have\
  \ occasionally met his daughter a few times when she was a teenager, and she always\
  \ struck me as a big daddy's girl. Now she is 21, and since she was seated next\
  \ to her father all night, I got a glimpse at how weirdly affectionate they are\
  \ together. \n\nThey would giggle and take goofy selfies, she would give him repeated\
  \ kisses on the cheek and would tease him about it leaving a lipstick mark, she\
  \ would link arms with him and snuggle into his neck, they held hands, and they\
  \ shared a single dessert and ate off each other's plates. And she had no issues\
  \ with finishing multiple glasses of wine in front of him. It was so weird, the\
  \ whole night. The whole family was there but it was like the two of them were sharing\
  \ every inside joke, just them. I could understand if she was a little kid, but\
  \ she's an actual adult. \n\nAs we were leaving a couple of us from our table were\
  \ having a smoke and I joked \"Do you think [colleague] is going to bed with his\
  \ daughter or his wife tonight?\" When they gave me a weird look like they didn't\
  \ get it, I said that there was clearly something weird there but they told me to\
  \ drop it. \n\nBack in the office a couple people have chastised me for starting\
  \ \"malicious rumours\", but it really was just a joke. I am now worried this gossip\
  \ will reach him, and since he is well-respected and well-liked, people will side\
  \ with him. I know my joke may have been a bit off colour, but was it really that\
  \ bad?\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: Okay, clearly I fucked up. At least now I know what it's\
  \ like to have a post make the front page? Everyone's responses, especially the\
  \ ones describing their relationships to their parents, have been informative. My\
  \ family was never physically affectionate at all, and so to me it genuinely was\
  \ weird, concerning, and over the top. I see now I was wrong. I see now fucked up\
  \ the joke was. I am going to apologize to the coworkers I said it to, and I'll\
  \ have to pray it doesn't continue to spread around the office."
title: AITA for a joke I made about how weirdly close my colleague seemed with his
  adult daughter?
