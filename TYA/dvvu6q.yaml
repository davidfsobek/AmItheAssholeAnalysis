selftext: "\nI work about 4 miles from home and I really want to cut down my reliance\
  \ on cars, for fitness and environmental reasons. So I got a bike, and had been\
  \ meaning to learn to ride it for a while. I never learned as a kid. \n\nI didn't\
  \ feel comfortable riding on city streets at first, so I asked my boyfriend to come\
  \ with me to bike trails in the suburbs and teach me. I started getting the basics\
  \ of it quick enough but I never felt too confident on a bike. \n\nI know that confidence\
  \ only comes with practice, but I just wasn't getting enough practice on the occasional\
  \ trips to the bike trail. So for a while, my bike sat neglected. \n\nThis week,\
  \ I decided, fuck it, the only way I'm really going to learn is by doing, so I asked\
  \ my boyfriend for one last lesson, this time in the city, and then I faced my nerves\
  \ and started biking to work.\n\nNow, I'm slow, I'm wobbly at times, once I step\
  \ down at a stop light it takes me a minute to get going and balanced. I'm especially\
  \ slow up hill because even with a good gear ratio I'm struggling because I'm not\
  \ in that good shape yet. But I'm getting better fast. And I'm feeling so good,\
  \ with the extra exercise.\n\nBut the streets near me are narrow and have a lot\
  \ of parked cars on either side so there's usually not room for cars to pass me\
  \ when driving. And a lot of drivers get pissed off at me for holding them up, for\
  \ taking a second to get going after a stop light, etc. I've had people yell at\
  \ me to get off the roads, yell nasty shit at me suggesting I'm mentally challenged,\
  \ in not so nice terms. Honk at me impatiently, etc.\n\nI try to be polite by pulling\
  \ off to the side of the road for a minute to let people pass, if I notice a big\
  \ line of cars behind me. Because I get it's annoying. Especially since it's rush\
  \ hour and everyone has somewhere to be.\n\nBut I really want to get better at biking\
  \ and that just comes with time and practice.\n\nAITA for biking to work even though\
  \ I'm bad at it currently?"

  I'm kinda bad at it?
