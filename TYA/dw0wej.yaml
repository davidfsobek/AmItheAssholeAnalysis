selftext: "So obviously the title is bad, and taken out of context clearly it's an\
  \ asshole move, and I agree on principal with that. I believe I'm justified for\
  \ what I said. I'm tired of being called an asshole by my family though, and I'd\
  \ like some unbiased opinions.\n\nMy family has struggled a little bit the last\
  \ couple of years financially. We've had bills paid, thank god, but not a ton of\
  \ extra money to do things I wish I was able to do with my kids.\n\nMy wife and\
  \ I have a 6 year old daughter and 3 year old son together. \n\nHolidays have been\
  \ rough the past couple of years, I can't even lie. Money isn't what's most important,\
  \ but there's a real pain of looking at your daughter see others who get more and\
  \ are better off. \n\nThat being said we tried to do the best we could to make the\
  \ holidays as special as possible. Our daughter got a ton of little gifts that when\
  \ wrapped made the presents under the tree look like a ton. She was happy of course,\
  \ she has such a positive attitude all the time, but when she receives something\
  \ she's extremely grateful and I couldn't be more proud of how she handles herself.\
  \ Last year Santa brought her a bike as the big present. \n\nMy wife has 2 brothers\
  \ and a sister. The sister is married and has 3 kids with her husband. One in particular\
  \ is awful, let's call her Sid. Hell raiser classic type. Ruins every family outing\
  \ or tries too anyways, is rude to the other kids in the family, talks back and\
  \ doesn't listen. \n\nShe's a little older than my daughter but around the same\
  \ age so they are around each other quite a bit. \n\nThe other day all 3 of the\
  \ kids are at our house. I'm in the kitchen cooking. My daughter and Sid are at\
  \ the table in the dining room. The conversation is Christmas and what they are\
  \ expecting and would like to get. \n\nSid won't stop bragging about the presents\
  \ she got last year. I didn't catch all of it or know what they all were but obviously\
  \ expensive and glamorous enough to make my daughter envious. My daughter questioned\
  \ out loud, \"I wonder why Santa brings you more than me.\" To which Sid replied\
  \ basically with her being better than my daughter. She wasn't good enough to get\
  \ the gifts Sid gets. I could see my daughter processing this and believing something\
  \ about how she is wasn't good enough compared to this spoiled brat. So I couldn't\
  \ take it. I told Sid in front of my daughter Santa wasn't real. It was her parents\
  \ that supply the gifts. She definitely should never think getting material things\
  \ makes her better than anybody. \n\nThis was news to Sid and my little girl. Neither\
  \ knew how to react, tho once explaining everything to my daughter I'm proud of\
  \ the lesson that came out thru all this. My wife's sister is pissed at me for telling\
  \ her daughter this. Said they were talking like normal kids and I ruined something\
  \ for her. I say she was getting the wrong message anyways and I wasn't going to\
  \ stand by her relaying her point of view on my daughter. AITA?"
