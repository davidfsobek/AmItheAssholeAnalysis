  &#x200B;


  I have 3 wonderful daugthers that I love with my entire heart but I''ve always wanted
  to have a son. My wife is expecting our 4th child and we had a gender reveal party
  last week. When I saw that we''re having another daugther I really lost it. I didn''t
  show it to everyone but I really melted inside. I went to the bathroom and cried
  for about 20 minutes until my wife came inside and saw me crying. She got really
  upset about it.


  I will love my new daugther as much as I love my other children but I''ve just really
  always wanted to have a son aswell who I can take hunting, teach him everything
  I know etc.


  So am I the asshole for getting upset that I''m probably never going to get a son?'
