selftext: "My ex husband and I share custody of our 10 year old daughter and 12 year\
  \ old son. We have a 2-2-3 schedule which usually looks like I have the kids Friday\
  \ after school and then he gets them Monday after school. I get them back Wednesday\
  \ after school and then he gets them Friday after school and then the week flip\
  \ flops. We've done this since our divorce 5 years ago and it works well. I'm a\
  \ nurse in the OR so I schedule my shifts for the days during the week when they\
  \ are with their dad and my one call weekend every 6 weeks is a weekend they are\
  \ with their dad. \n\nRecently, the kids said they want to try splitting up on the\
  \ weekends, so instead of both of them being with one us during the weekend, one\
  \ will go with dad and one will be with me. My son said he would make sure he was\
  \ with me on call weekends because he can stay by himself if I have to get called\
  \ in or can hang out at the hospital until I'm done. My ex is on board with this\
  \ because he says it will allow us to spend one on one time with the kids and will\
  \ allow the kids a break from each other (they squabble occasionally and annoy one\
  \ another). While they have a point- sometimes it is hard to not feel like you are\
  \ disappointing one by trying to accommodate the other, I do not want to give up\
  \ my free weekends. It took me a few months to get used to not having my kids all\
  \ the time after the divorce but now my weekends without them are filled with activities\
  \ or travel. My ex agreed if there was a weekend trip I wanted to take he would\
  \ be fine having both the kids that weekend but I honestly don't want to have to\
  \ take his schedule into consideration when planning my trips, and sometimes they\
  \ are spontaneous trips. \n\nI was talking to my family about this at breakfast\
  \ this morning and they are all kind of appalled by me not wanting to do this. My\
  \ sister pointed out that if I was still married, then I wouldn't have all the child\
  \ free time I have now and many mothers don't get a break from their kids like I\
  \ do. My mom said she can't believe I'd deny my children quality time with their\
  \ parents for selfish reasons like not wanting to give up my weekends. My SIL seemed\
  \ to understand where I was coming from but said that she would still do it and\
  \ just incorporate the child into whatever I was doing and pointed out my daughter\
  \ would love to go on the NYC shopping trip I had planned for December and my son\
  \ would happily join me for my Saturday morning spin classes. I considered that\
  \ but my SIL loves taking her kids everywhere so I don't know that she is aware\
  \ of how nice it is to just be an adult without the responsibility of a child wherever\
  \ you go. They were really making me feel like an asshole though. AITA?"
