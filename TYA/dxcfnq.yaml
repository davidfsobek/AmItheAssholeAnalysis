selftext: 'Groom here. My fiancee and I are getting married in about a year. She''s
  already started shopping for her wedding dress and asked me to start taking a look
  at suits. Honestly, though, I''m really not much of a suit and tie kind of guy,
  and I dress extremely casually in my day-to-day life. Obviously, I''m going to make
  a point to look sharper than usual for the wedding. I''m planning to wear my favorite
  pair of jeans with a blazer and a decent button-up shirt, which should be comfortable
  while still looking nice.


  My fiancee got really upset when I said I wasn''t going to wear a suit. She thinks
  jeans are way too casual for a wedding and says I''m going to look ridiculous and
  underdressed. But I don''t think that''s true. It''s not like I''m showing up in
  overalls and no shirt or something dumb like that, and I was a groomsman in a wedding
  just last year where all the guys wore jeans and suspenders.


  I would never in a million years tell my fiancee what to wear to our wedding, because
  that would be insanely controlling, so I don''t think she should get a say in what
  I wear. AITA?


  Edit: The wedding is in the woods at a forest preserve, if that makes a difference.'
