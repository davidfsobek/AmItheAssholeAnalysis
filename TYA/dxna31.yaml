selftext: 'Hi Reddit,


  I''m (Indian, 29M) a graduate student dating a post-doctoral researcher (Chinese,
  33F) working in the same lab as me. We have been together, rather rockily for the
  past 4 years.


  Last night, I got back to the States after a vacation in India, 25 flight hours
  away. I picked up some gifts for my girlfriend while I was there. She did not like
  any of them. She said, they seemed like "cheap stuff you would get from the Dollar
  Store." She compared it to the $150 handwatch that I bought for my mom and \~$150
  cosmetics I packed for my sister, who got married last month. While I was in India,
  she was shopping online for clothing and accessories from expensive brands I had
  not even heard of. So, I had a feeling her reacting like this was on the cards.
  Nevertheless, I thought she might appreciate the gesture.


  Specifically, I got her earrings, a sunglasses case, a contact lens case and a scarf
  from a store that specialized in making the products feel very Indian, so they made
  for nice souvenirs. The lining inside the sunglasses case had slightly de-bonded
  which we only found out on unboxing the thing. She did not try on the earrings because
  they looked "rusted and scratched." I had bought her a phone case as well, but the
  seller mis-marked the model and it did not fit her phone. (To be honest, I would
  not be buying from that store again.) The monetary value of the gifts would amount
  to \~$50. I think I put some thought while choosing things that might be useful
  to her. But, I had not anticipated some of the QC issues we encountered. I knew
  beforehand that it would not be enough for her and had planned on getting her a
  \~$150 handbag here. Her birthday is in 2 days.


  The same thing happened 2 years back when I came back from another vacation. I got
  her a few souvenirs back then and she basically fought with me the entire night.
  I appeased her by buying a bicycle that she used for maybe 1-2 times. She dries
  towels on it these days. During these 4 years, I have bought her gifts (sometimes
  expensive, sometimes cheap) and such, only to see them catching dust in some corner
  of her apartment. I have felt hurt every time, but I quickly get over it and brush
  it off as a part of her nature.


  So, I''m thinking she acted like an asshole here. I might also post to r/relationship_advice
  based on the feedback here.


  EDIT: Not the one I wanted to make but anyway. So, after the above happened last
  weekend. We decided to put this episode behind us and go forward. It was also decided
  that I would not buy her any present for her birthday (even then I asked her a few
  times last weekend) and neither would she due to all this. Except. We spent time
  together this weekend, returned her stuff back to the malls, shopped and general
  hanging out at her place. She is going back home for 6 weeks in about 15 days and
  has been shopping for her family and friends. Today, she was expecting her packages
  and so she went home early. A couple of hours back she sent me sent me a picture
  of  bag asking if it looked good. I said it was good. She said it was meant for
  her sister. A few moments later, 2 more pics of handbags. She had asked my opinion
  on one of them when I was in India. She said it was a great deal that day and so
  she ordered away. The other one is for her mom. Then she asked me if I would like
  to reimburse for the handbag she had purchased as her birthday gift. I declined
  saying she should have let me bought it instead. She then offered to return it and
  have me buy it. At this point, I did not know what to say -- I felt hurt, to say
  the least. I took a breath, stopping what I was doing and thought it over. 5 mins
  later, I asked her how much was it and then transferred the money. I then decided
  to call it a day and walked home trying to understand her actions. Meanwhile, I
  missed her video call and have been helping her decide if she wants to pick a better
  one for her mom. I don''t know what I should be feeling. Certainly not anger.'

  her?
