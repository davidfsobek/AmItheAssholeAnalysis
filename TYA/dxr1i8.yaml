selftext: 'I have 2 children who live at home. My son is 30 and moved back home 1
  year ago; my daughter is 19 and has been a vegetarian for about 2 years. She does
  her own cooking and cooks 4-5 times a week, sometimes just for herself but 1-2 times
  she cooks a meal special for her and I and occasionally for the whole family (but
  her father and brother will add meat in that case i.e to tacos). She''s a very good
  cook and I don''t think she''s ever made a meal I''ve disliked.


  However often the meals she makes 1-2 times a week for the two of us are not adaptable
  to have meat - vegetarian lasagna or a curry etc. Her father will not eat a meal
  without meat but to his credit is accommodating when my daughter makes such meals
  and will cook whatever won''t be in her way. Often it''s leftovers from the night
  before, or if he knows she only needs the oven for our meal, he''ll maybe cook a
  steak and rice on the stovetop.


  The problem for us has become my son. He will sometimes decide he doesn''t want
  either the vegetarian meal or the meat meal my husband makes - my husband usually
  cooks the same 4 dishes or has leftovers; my son is sick of those. If I''m cooking
  for the 3 of us and my daughter is only cooking for herself, he''s fine to eat with
  us. It''s only when my daughter is cooking and my husband is doing his own thing
  it''s a problem. He''s a chef so I can kind of understand he may think our meals
  are too basic... My son will want to make himself something else for dinner BUT  still
  want to eat with us so he''ll want to cook at the same time as us and then we have
  3 different meals/people in the kitchen. I understand he wants to eat with us as
  a family but he often doesn''t even eat lunch until 3-4 so I don''t understand how
  he''s so hungry as to need to cook his own meal for dinner with us at 6-6:30? There
  is always too much going on, too many dishes and our kitchen is just too small to
  accommodate this. We also hardly ever know until the late afternoon whether my son
  will even be home for dinner or if he''s not happy with the dinner and wants his
  own thing.


  Last week, my daughter was cooking for us and there was strife for my daughter and
  husband as he was in their way while they were trying to cook. My daughter didn''t
  make a big deal of it at the time but later told me she was done cooking for the
  2 of us unless we knew 100% for sure her brother wouldn''t be home, as it wasn''t
  worth the headache of trying to coordinate and do dishes for 3 different meals.


  I don''t want my daughter to stop cooking for us. Her vegetarian meals are good
  and healthy and  I''ve started to sleep better and lose weight since even eating
  1 vegetarian dinner a week. I would rather ask my son to either eat her vegetarian
  meal with us or eat their father''s meat meal so we only have 2 different dinners
  going on, or at least wait until after we''ve finished in the kitchen for him to
  cook. I don''t want to be unfair to him or either of my children but it''s clear
  this isn''t working. WIBTA if I asked this of him?'
