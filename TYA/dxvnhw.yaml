selftext: "Throwaway, keeping some details vague so as to not be identified.\n\nI\
  \ (30F) have one older brother, John (32M). Our mother isn't in the picture and\
  \ hasn't been since we were young. Our dad (64M) passed away a few weeks ago from\
  \ longterm health complications, and I was shocked to discover that he had left\
  \ almost everything to me in his will, including investments in various stocks/bonds/other\
  \ assets and a significant amount of cash. He left John one small sentimental item,\
  \ a guitar he used to play for us when we were little.\n\nDad and I had a great\
  \ relationship, while his relationship with John was much more strained. He was\
  \ the kind of person who believed in tough love and had high expectations for both\
  \ of us. I know he didn't like a lot of my brother's life choices (he got poor grades\
  \ in school, dropped out of college his freshman year, and was directionless for\
  \ a long time before finding a stable job), while I excelled academically and have\
  \ been fairly successful in my chosen career path. I can only make assumptions as\
  \ to why Dad wanted to divide his will this way, and this is the best guess I have.\n\
  \nThe thing is, this is a life-changing amount of money. Dad always lived frugally\
  \ and worked hard, and he made some solid investments. My husband and I crunched\
  \ the numbers, and if we invest responsibly, we could both retire now. We've been\
  \ wanting to start a family, and this could give both us and our future children\
  \ a life we could never have dreamed of otherwise.\n\nJohn and I aren't close at\
  \ all, but we talk occasionally and get along fine whenever we do see each other.\
  \ I know he was deeply hurt when he found out how Dad had divided up our inheritance.\
  \ He has not asked me to split my portion with him, but I can tell he's really bothered\
  \ by the situation.\n\nI loved my dad very much, and because of that, I'm reluctant\
  \ to go against his last wishes. He may have had valid reasons for not sharing the\
  \ money with John that I know nothing about. But at the same time, while my brother\
  \ isn't the most driven/responsible guy, he is also not a bad person, and I obviously\
  \ wouldn't be posting here if I didn't have any doubts about this decision.\n\n\
  **Edit: I would like to thank everyone for the feedback I've received. I want you\
  \ to know that I've read all of your\_comments, every single one, and I appreciate\
  \ all of the perspectives,\_thoughts, and advice you've provided. As I posted above,\
  \ I would not be here\_if I didn't feel troubled or conflicted by this situation.**\n\
  \n**I have no more answers than any of you as to why this happened. I don't know\
  \ if Dad wanted to teach John some sort of lesson, if he didn't think he would be\
  \ responsible with the money, or if he just thought he didn't deserve it. Maybe\
  \ he wrote the will in anger after an argument. Maybe he regretted not changing\
  \ it before he died. Maybe he did it for all of these reasons, or for none of them.\
  \ I don't know, and I don't think I'll ever know for sure. John swears he doesn't\
  \ know why Dad made this decision, and I'm going to take him at his word.**\_\n\n\
  **After a lot of reflection, I have decided to go with\_the most charitable possible\
  \ interpretation of the will, which is that Dad meant for both of us to split his\_\
  estate evenly but wanted me to be the one to distribute the money and make sure\
  \ John uses it\_wisely. So that's what I'm going to do.** \n\n**I will give John\
  \ 50 percent of everything I received. I'm going to set up an appointment with an\
  \ attorney to figure out the best way to do this, because I know there will be a\
  \ lot of taxes involved if I gift it all at once. Setting up some sort of trust\
  \ for him may be a better option. The remaining half of the estate will still give\
  \ my husband and me a significant head start on an early retirement if we continue\
  \ to work hard and save. It will just be a bit later down the line.**\n\n**I don't\
  \ know what else to say. This has all been so difficult to process, and it's all\
  \ wrapped up in this very raw, different sort of grief, the kind that comes from\
  \ knowing someone you loved was maybe not the person you thought they were. My God.\
  \ In some ways, that's a thousand times more painful than knowing that he's gone.**\_"
