selftext: "This isn't sexual, just about sleeping arrangements. Sorry for any unintentional\
  \ clickbait.\n\nMy husband, his parents, his brother and brother's fianc\xE9, and\
  \ my mother and I all went on a cruise together recently. My husband's parents really\
  \ wanted the cruise to happen. We got a 2 bedroom suite. My husband's parents paid\
  \ for 90% of the room and for everyone to have the non-alcoholic drink packages\
  \ because they wanted to, I guess. I'm not saying no. My mother had just lost her\
  \ husband (my father) and while she was finally free, she could use a fun trip.\
  \ So as a Christmas gift to her and to not make her a burden to my husband's parents,\
  \ we paid what would be her portion of the room, about 1k. Not bad at all. \n\n\
  My husband's parents took one room, and room two was going to be for the couples\
  \ to trade off, but my mother is old, turns in fairly early, and has back issues,\
  \ so we gave her the second room. This put all four young ones in the living room.\
  \ There were enough beds, but zero privacy. \n\nI had the worst time trying to sleep,\
  \ and lack of it combined with how...much energy a cruise demanded was getting to\
  \ me. My BIL and SIL were always snoring and making noise, the boat noises were\
  \ intense, and the Pullman bed was too thin. My mother offered for me to share her\
  \ room with her, and it was an easy choice. I love my husband, but it's not like\
  \ we were able to have sex or even cuddle, and I can't exactly enjoy a cruise when\
  \ I'm ready to pass out.\n\nI was able to be fun and happy for the remaining 5 days\
  \ of the trip, and I think we all had a great time. I'm now hearing that it's a\
  \ big Problem that I didn't share a room with my husband (and two other people,\
  \ mind), and that only a child would choose to share a bed with their mother over\
  \ a spouse.\n\nI don't think I did anything wrong, but I'll accept criticism."
