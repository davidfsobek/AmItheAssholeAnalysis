selftext: "I recently moved into a new apartment building. As you exit the elevator,\
  \ my neighbour's door is on the right, and mine on the left. We have one shared\
  \ wall between our doors. There is a bare wall to the left of my door, and a wall\
  \ to the right of my neighbour's door which they have panelled as an extension of\
  \ their front door. This means they cannot hang any decorations on that wall.\n\n\
  When I moved in, the wall between our doors was a shrine. There was a large religious\
  \ painting in the center, surrounded by religious adornments, and two tables under\
  \ them also covered with religious adornments. I decided to be upfront and rang\
  \ my neighbour's bell, introduced myself and explained I wasn't comfortable living\
  \ with religious iconography outside my door. I spoke to the wife, who was home\
  \ at the time, and she seemed genuinely nice. She explained my apartment had been\
  \ vacant so no one minded, but she would move it if it made me more comfortable.\n\
  \nWhat has followed is six months of pure hell. Each time I spoke to her she said\
  \ she would clear the wall, she just hadn't gotten around to it yet. After reminding\
  \ her, at first gently and intermittently, and later less nicely and more frequently,\
  \ she finally took down most of the religious adornments. The tables were the first\
  \ to go (they were a fire hazard any way), then the other ornaments, and finally\
  \ only the painting was left. It's very large, it's the first thing I see when I\
  \ come home, and as a non-religious person it makes me angry that I am being forced\
  \ to live with iconography outside my front door that does not represent who I am\
  \ as a person.\n\nOnce it became clear she was not going to moving the painting,\
  \ I escalated the matter to the building society, who at first sympathised with\
  \ me, but later said they could not help. I have since found out my neighbour is\
  \ on the board of the society, and obviously has some pull. After refusing to drop\
  \ the matter, I have even been accused of stirring religious disharmony in the building,\
  \ which I find ridiculous. One board member went so far as to say since it's a religious\
  \ painting, I CAN'T ask her to take it down.\n\nMy friends are telling me that I'm\
  \ overreacting and it's better to keep the peace. On some level, I understand that\
  \ certain people feel the need to \"protect their home\" with religious iconography\
  \ outside their door. But it's not my problem that they decided to panel the wall\
  \ to the other side of their door, so they cannot use it to display their reverence.\n\
  \nSince the society won't help me, I am tempted to do something truly petty, like\
  \ fill every available inch of wall space on BOTH sides of my door with images from\
  \ ALL religions. Which abides with the unofficial building rule that we can't ask\
  \ people to take down religious pictures.\n\nI really can't tell if I'm justified\
  \ in my anger, or I'm just being an asshole about this?\n\n**EDIT:** I am not an\
  \ atheist, nor have I at any time claimed to be one, so kindly stop attacking me\
  \ about that. Since I apparently have to spell my beliefs out, I do believe in God\
  \ but I am not a religious person. In fact the amount of suffering and violence\
  \ perpetuated in the name of \"religion\" (and I'm speaking here both generally\
  \ and from personal experience) make me incredibly uncomfortable around ANY over\
  \ the top display of religious fervour. And yes, having an extremely large religious\
  \ painting hanging outside my front door does fall into that category for me. And\
  \ yes, I've had this conversation with my neighbour, several times, where she's\
  \ said she sees where I'm coming from and agreed to move her stuff. But then just\
  \ didn't. \n\nI'd also request people taking the time to respond to actually read\
  \ the post instead of assuming things. No, my neighbour is not an \"old lady\",\
  \ nor is she my \"roommate\". If you insist on assuming which religion I'm talking\
  \ about, even though I've been clear about not specifying it, you're just making\
  \ an ass out of you and...well...you. And just because I used the idiom \"pure hell\"\
  \ does not make me sheltered, I've been through enough in my life, but if calling\
  \ me sheltered makes you feel superior and helps you sleep at night, go for it.\n\
  \nI'm done reading replies because the majority of people replying are more interested\
  \ making up stories in their heads and calling me names (everything from dick and\
  \ moronic baby to edge lord...that last one had my colleagues cracking up). Will\
  \ post pictures of my flying spaghetti monster once I put it up. It will be put\
  \ up on my own wall though, because (a) contrary to the names people are calling\
  \ me here, I'm not an evil human being (though I can be petty sometimes...never\
  \ claimed I was perfect) and (b) there's no space on the \"shared wall\" anyway.\n\
  \nHave a good one! And thank you to the kind stranger for the silver :)"
