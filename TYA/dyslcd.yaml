selftext: "I was having dinner with my extended family and my brothers wife and daughter\
  \ were sitting next to me. I don\u2019t love my sister in law, honestly I didn\u2019\
  t really want my brother to marry her because I find her to be a bit disrespectful\
  \ and kind of a ditz at times, but I try to be cordial.\n\nHer daughter started\
  \ talking to me and asked me what I do for a living. I told her I\u2019m a college\
  \ professor. She asked my sister in law what a professor was, and my sister in law\
  \ called me a \u201Ccollege teacher.\u201D I found this pretty rude since I studied\
  \ for a long time to get this position and I primarily do research in a pretty prominent\
  \ lab rather than teaching, so I corrected her and said that I am actually a researcher.\
  \ \n\nLater my brother pulled me aside and told me that I was rude and should have\
  \ just let it go. I said that I didn\u2019t but realize correcting someone was rude.\
  \ I worked hard for my job and I prefer to be given that credit. My brother called\
  \ me pretentious. My wife agrees that my sister in law didn\u2019t describe my job\
  \ properly but thinks I should have let it go. Am I the asshole for correcting her\
  \ for calling me a teacher when that\u2019s not what I do?"
