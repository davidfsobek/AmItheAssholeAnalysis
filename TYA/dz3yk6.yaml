selftext: "My sister and I are both pregnant. I'm due a few weeks before her. We both\
  \ went to dinner with our parents yesterday.\n\nAt dinner we were chatting about\
  \ some ''cutest baby'' competition on facebook and were joking about entering it.\
  \ I have red hair, and Lauren (my sister) jokingly said her and her baby could play\
  \ against my ''little ginger baby''. \n\nLauren has a disability. She has extremely\
  \ bad eyes. Worn glasses since she was a baby and even with them on cannot see well.\
  \ Without them she can't see anything except colours. \n\nLauren and I both have\
  \ ''dark'' senses of humour, and have both said things that are maybe not appropriate\
  \ to each other. When she made the ginger baby joke, I shot back that we'd happily\
  \ go against her ''little blind baby with it's tiny glasses''. Soon as I said this\
  \ everyone looked shocked. Lauren excused herself and later left without saying\
  \ goodbye. \n\nI did text Lauren to apologise but she hasn't responded. My parents\
  \ were both very upset with me for what I said, even though Lauren and I have had\
  \ banter like that with no issue at all. I told my husband what happened and he\
  \ thinks that while I made an inappropriate comment, it wasn't meant to be malicious\
  \ and that everyone is being unfair. \n\nAITA?"
