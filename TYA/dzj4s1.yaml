selftext: "I am a resident physician and also a PhD candidate. My wife is a full time\
  \ graduate student.\n\nLast night we were at a social function where we wanted to\
  \ make a good impression and we met someone new. Our new acquaintance asked what\
  \ I did for a living, and I said I was an OBGYN. She then turned to my wife and\
  \ asked what she did, my wife replied she was a PhD student. \n\nThis I why I might\
  \ be an asshole, because I kinda butted in and said \u201Coh yeah, I\u2019m actually\
  \ a PhD student also\u201D. It had just occurred to me.\n\nWhen we got home my wife\
  \ asked why I always feel the need to mention that I\u2019m a PhD student too. That\
  \ isn\u2019t it enough that I\u2019m a doctor. I can understand why in this case\
  \ I might have been rude because I kinda butted in, but all the times I\u2019ve\
  \ mentioned it in the past I normally remember to do so at the beginning \u201C\
  I\u2019m a OBGYN and a PhD student\u201D but I forgot this time. Her mentioning\
  \ it reminded me! \n\nShe seems to think I shouldn\u2019t mention it at all to allow\
  \ her to shine. She pointed out that people tend to ask me before her and so it\
  \ makes her feel silly replying \u201Cjust a PhD student\u201D after I\u2019ve given\
  \ out my response. But I don\u2019t see why I should keep my accomplishments hidden.\
  \ After all we are a team and 2 PhDs are better than one!\n\nAITA?\n\nEdited: clarifications\n\
  \nEdit 2: I am already a doctor, I have my MD in hand. I am still working on my\
  \ PhD. I am not in a combined MD-PhD program."
