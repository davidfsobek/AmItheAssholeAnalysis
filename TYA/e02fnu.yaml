selftext: "I work in a big office setting but there's a woman who sits near me, Mary,\
  \ who talks about her kids a lot. I live in Canada. Mary is from Haiti and moved\
  \ here a few years ago with her husband and then they had two kids. Mary was telling\
  \ a bunch of us about an upcoming Pajama Day at her kid's school. Mary didn't think\
  \ it was appropriate that kids go to school in their pajamas, which she equated\
  \ to underwear. I don't have kids, so I didn't say anything, and I dunno maybe pajamas\
  \ at school are weird these days. So I was happy to stay out of the conversation,\
  \ but Mary turned to me during the discussion and said \"Officepossum you were born\
  \ here. Did you have these Pajama Day things when you were a kid? It seems so weird\
  \ to me, we would never do that back home.\" I said yeah we had them as a kid, and\
  \ my sister's kids have them, it's just a thing here.   \nMary: \"I think it's disgusting,\
  \ I'm not sending them to school basically in their underwear! First it's Halloween\
  \ and I have to pull them out because the school does a parade and we don't celebrate\
  \ Halloween so they have to stay home or they don't get included. Now I have to\
  \ keep them home for this Pajama Day thing! Why do you do these things here? They\
  \ make no sense!\"  \nAnd where's where I was an asshole according to some of my\
  \ coworkers. I said \"That's what we do in Canada. Kids do fun things like dress\
  \ up in costumes or wear pajamas to school. That's why people want to come here.\"\
  \  \nMary immediately got huffy, would not speak to me for the rest of the day.\
  \ Later on I was told around the kitchen that what I basically said was \"If you\
  \ don't like it go back to Haiti\". I do not think that's what I said, at least\
  \ that's not what I meant. But maybe it's how it came out? So looking for some clarification.\
  \   \nTLDR: I told a coworker that's just what it's like in Canada, but she took\
  \ it as \"...so if you don't like it go home\". AITA?"
title: AITA for basically telling my coworker if she doesn't like this country, go
  home?
