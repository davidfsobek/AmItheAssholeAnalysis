selftext: "A month ago as I was commuting back home on a bus. The buses in my city\
  \ have priority seating in the front for different-abled people and the seats are\
  \ clearly coloured coded for everyone to see.  Since it was rush hour, and there\
  \ was no immediate elderly/disabled/pregnant lady, I decided to sit in the priority\
  \ seating and play on my 3DS to pass the time.\n\nNow I want to emphasize that whenever\
  \ the bus stopped and let passengers in, I would take a glance to see if there anyone\
  \ who needed priority seating and if there wasn't, I would just go back to my game.\
  \ \n\nNow a new batch of people has come in and I take a glance, and decided no\
  \ one needed priority and go back to my business while a young couple has moved\
  \ in and stood in front of me. A few minutes in, an elderly man who is sitting next\
  \ to me offers his seat to the woman in front of me and she politely takes his offer\
  \ and sits next to me. I think cool, an old school gentlemen and go back to my game.\
  \ Moments later, this lady's husband angrily mumbles about rude people on the bus,\
  \ playing their games to pay attention to anything. Immediately I know he is talking\
  \ about me, and I snap at him to shut up and ask what his problem was. He tells\
  \ me that if I was paying attention, I would've noticed his wife was pregnant and\
  \ that an old man wouldn't have to give up his seat for her. \n\nTo my embarrassment,\
  \ and I profusely/half angrily apologize and offer my seat to the old man (which\
  \ he takes).  The old man tells the husband to forgive me and for me to stop talking\
  \ (which I do and move away).\n\nAfter awhile I take a glance at his wife and I'm\
  \ estimating she is maybe 3-4 months pregnant (I just had a baby this year) but\
  \ it's not immediately obvious as she's not skinny and wearing a loose blouse but\
  \ the old man was able to notice so maybe it's my fault.\n\nMy wife tells me NTA\
  \ because the husband could've asked me to give up my seat (which she reminds that\
  \ I've done for her when she was pregnant) but I'm not too sure, thoughts reddit?\n\
  \n**EDIT:** To address people saying I shouldn't have sat there in the first place,\
  \ the priority bus seating is like handicapped washrooms, it's not exclusive for\
  \ handicapped individuals but they take priority.\nSecondly, I'm **from Toronto**,\
  \ and when you're in rush hour, everyone is tired and everyone wants to sit on their\
  \ long commute home. It is common for ALL seats to be filled regardless if its priority\
  \ seating or not, it's just the city culture. People either had to be observative\
  \ when sitting there or just politely give up their seats when asked to by the bus\
  \ driver or the differently-abled person. I appreciate all the passionate comments\
  \ about this topic though.\n\n**EDIT 2:** I'm a dude, some people were confused\
  \ when I said \"I had a baby\" when it was my wife who did, I'm just used to saying\
  \ this in real life and I understand how it sounds on written/screen when you're\
  \ not specific.\n\n**LAST EDIT 3:** Lots of people are questioning my opinion about\
  \ how actually far along the pregnant lady actually was and calling me TA for even\
  \ mentioning her body. I think we can respectfully talk about the diversity of women\
  \ bodies and the numerous ways they can look during various stages of pregnancy.\
  \ This lady has a very similar body to my wife, and my wife's pregnancy is still\
  \ very fresh on my mind since I have a 4 month old. My wife didn't look pregnant\
  \ either at 3-4 months, and you could've argued she might have had a big lunch lol."
