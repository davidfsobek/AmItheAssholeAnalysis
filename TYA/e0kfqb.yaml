selftext: "This happened earlier this morning.\n\nI needed a new set of passport photos\
  \ for visas. I took my thumb drive to CVS and printed out a 39 cent 4x6 with a 6\
  \ passport photo template. I asked the guy at the counter if I could borrow the\
  \ paper cutter. I\u2019ve done this before and the employees let me\nuse it and\
  \ I\u2019ve never had a problem.\n\nInstead the employee says to me with a very\
  \ dry tone, \"you're not allowed to print passport photos yourself here.\" I seriously\
  \ thought he was just joking and giving me shit and I smiled and laughed. He was\
  \ totally deadpan. He repeated himself again. I laughed again, and he was still\
  \ deadpan. I said to him, \u201Cyou're kidding around with me, right?\" he said\
  \ \u201Cno, we charge $14.99 for passport photos, you're not allowed to print passport\
  \ photos yourself here.\u201D\n\nI said again, \u201Cman, you're kidding, right?\"\
  \ he said he wasn't. I told him they're already printed, and he stupidly repeated\
  \ that the machines aren't for passport photos. I said who cares what they are it's\
  \ a 4x6 photo. Then he said i'm not allowed to purchase the photos.\n\nI figured\
  \ i'd just ignore him and go to the cashier with my payment slip and pay my 39 cents\
  \ so I could get my damn photo and not have to go to another cvs/walgreens. I\u2019\
  d have to cut them with scissors at home. I did so, and friendly cashier rang me\
  \ up and i paid the 39 cents plus tax.\n\nThen I realized I needed an envelope for\
  \ the photo because i didnt want to mess it up. I went back to the photo counter\
  \ and asked for an envelope. The same twerp refused to give me an envelope. I said\
  \ I paid for the photo, i'm entitled to an envelope. he said I need to pay $14.99\
  \ if i want passport photos.\n\nAt this point I was furious. I told him it doesn't\
  \ matter what they're for or what they are. I said, \"I could print 6 two by two\
  \ pictures of my butt on a 4x6 photo using the machine, and it doesn't matter if\
  \ it's my face of my butt, it\u2019s still 39 cents!\u201D\n\nI then went behind\
  \ the counter and took an envelope, as he said, \"don't go behind the counter.\"\
  \ Then he got on the loudspeaker and said \"manager to photo, manager to photo.\"\
  \n\ni told him, \"you\u2019re a moron\u201D and walked out of the store. No manager\
  \ or other employee tried to stop me.\n\nAITA\n\n**EDIT: wow this blew up!**Was\
  \ not expecting it to get to the front page. Just wanted to clarify a few things:\n\
  \n1) ive done this before both for myself and for family thats why i was saying\
  \ \"youre kidding right?\" incredulously. Ive never once ha d a problem printing\
  \ the photos or them not meeting the requirements.i know what im doing\n\n2) photo\
  \ guy had the same deadpan monotone the entire time with no voice inflection even\
  \ when he told me to not go behind the counter and called for the manager\n\n3)\
  \ i was only behind the counter for like a second. I saw the envelopes and put like\
  \ one foot in and then reached over and grabbed one envelope and left. By the time\
  \ he finished saying \"dont go behind the counter\" i was out"
title: AITA for printing out my own passport photos from my thumb drive at CVS for
  $0.39 instead of paying $14.99 for passport photos?
