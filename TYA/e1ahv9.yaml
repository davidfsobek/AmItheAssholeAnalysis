selftext: 'The title makes me sound like TA off the bat, but hear me out... Last year
  for Christmas, my husband asked what I wanted and I asked for a pair of Samsung
  wireless earbuds in yellow. I told him please don''t bother if he couldn''t find
  them in yellow and to get me something else or maybe a gift card so I could order
  them online. I''m usually not very picky, but I was really clear on this because
  I really really just wanted the yellow ones. It''s silly, but I love yellow and
  I was excited to have the yellow earbuds.


  My husband bought the black ones. When I opened them on Christmas, I was a little
  taken aback because I only had one request. He had also gotten them the day after
  I told him what I wanted, so by the time I opened them, it was too late to exchange
  them and get yellow or anything. He said he couldn''t find any in yellow and just
  bought the ones they had available at the store. I was honestly disappointed, but
  can''t justify not wearing them or something silly like that. So I use them and
  like them.



  Now my husband wants a pair of Samsung earbuds for Christmas---in black. WIBTA if
  I just gave him the old ones and bought myself the yellow ones? I didn''t want black
  to begin with, plus I don''t want to buy him a black pair and deal with them getting
  mixed up all the time!


  **UPDATE: I talked to my husband. I will be just giving him the black earbuds (he
  is super psyched to have them!) and buying him the other things on his Christmas
  wish list. He will be returning the main present he bought me and just buying me
  the yellow headphones I originally asked for last year. Thanks for all the responses.**'
