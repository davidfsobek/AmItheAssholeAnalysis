selftext: "My oldest daughter turned 16 this spring and got her driver\u2019s license\
  \ this summer. My wife and I agreed to add her to our insurance policy on the condition\
  \ that she continues to earn a 3.6 GPA or higher each quarter. Our daughter is a\
  \ very good student and gets mostly As with the occasional B, so we didn\u2019t\
  \ think this would be an issue. She doesn\u2019t have a job outside of school, so\
  \ we expect her to focus on academics and keep her grades up. Our daughter agreed\
  \ and said this was fair. \n\nHer first-quarter report card came in the mail last\
  \ week, and she has a C in two of her classes, honors calculus and AP Chemistry.\
  \ We asked her about this, and she said she doesn\u2019t know why she isn\u2019\
  t doing well and that they\u2019re just hard classes. We offered to get her a tutor,\
  \ but she got angry and refused, saying she\u2019s not stupid and doesn\u2019t need\
  \ one. \n\nWe reminded her of the agreement we made and said since she hasn\u2019\
  t held up her part of the bargain and won\u2019t work with a tutor, she will no\
  \ longer be allowed to drive my wife\u2019s car. We\u2019ll reevaluate in a few\
  \ months when her semester grades come in. She\u2019s been mad at us ever since.\
  \ \n\nI talked to some of my colleagues about it at work, and they think we\u2019\
  re being too harsh, so I was curious and decided to post here. AITA?"
