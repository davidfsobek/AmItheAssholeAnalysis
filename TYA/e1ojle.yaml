selftext: 'My wife is very attractive and is in her late 20s. I''m still not sure
  how I managed to get her. She works as a medical rep and makes very good money.
  I was always certain that and does use her beauty to sell her products. Most people
  talking to her you can see do want to do things that she says just to please her.
  She gets free drinks at bars all the time. It is kinda weird


  We went to a party together and one of the doctors that she sells to saw her over
  there work me. She introduced me and the doctor was really surprised she was married.
  That some weirded me out. I asked her why he would think that especially when she
  wears a massive ring as well. She then mentioned that she never wears a ring when
  she tries selling. This really annoyed me. Her reasoning was that she thinks that
  her sales dropped after she got married and started wearing a ring. I told her that
  the only reason that is true is if they think that by buying the products they can
  get in your pants. We got into bit of an argument. But right now we are both ignoring
  that we had a fight. So what do you think? AITA for wanting her to wear a ring?


  Edit: I have never seen much except the first two episodes of big bang theory. But
  apparently there is an episode that is similar. I might watch that episode


  Edit2: I don''t consider her my property, I might have some insecurity about this
  relationship as well. But I think my major issue was that she had never mentioned
  this to me before. If she did, I might have been ok with this.


  Edit3: I have never thought she is cheating. She is a natural bubbly and friendly
  person and attractive and can make the other person think she is flirting. But I
  have never had any reason to think she would cheat.'
