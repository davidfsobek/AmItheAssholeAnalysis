selftext: "I have two sons from a previous marriage ages 8 and 9. I've had full custody\
  \ for the last three years and it's just the step mom and me now. Their mother is\
  \ no longer in the picture.\n\nThey were so excited about christmas last year. There\
  \ were many presents for them under the tree from the grand parents and us, and\
  \ they were constantly checking them out trying to guess what was in them. \n\n\
  They could hardly wait for Christmas day and begged us to let them open some presents\
  \ early. So we allowed them to open one present that was gifted to both of them.\
  \ It was the heaviest package under the tree and you could feel their excitement\
  \ when I told them they could open it on Christmas eve. They tore into it like a\
  \ couple savages. I'd wrapped it very well to make it take a little time to get\
  \ at the goods. \n\nAs the final paper was ripped off the present, the oldest was\
  \ going like \"it's a..it's a\" and the final paper came off, \"brick\". I thought\
  \ it was hilarious. The looks on their faces was priceless. Unfortunatly they were\
  \ somewhat upset, tears were shed etc. So we let them open one more present to calm\
  \ them down.\n\nAm I the asshole for wrapping a brick as a present?"
