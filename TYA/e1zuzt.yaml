  two Group as I am the asshole, and the other Group laughs with me.


  So I work in a restaurant/pub, and as the night starts up, it is inevitable to have
  people, who are under 18, so we cannot serve them alcohol. They used to annoy me,
  because they hold up the line, and other costumers who can drink have to wait more.
  Not much, but frustrating.


  But it has changed. When I spot people, who are definitely underage, I have my personal
  fun time.


  This is how it usually goes down:


  The kids come to the counter, and when I spot them I immadiately put on my best
  costumer service smile. When they ask for a beer, or something else, I don''t ask
  for their ID right then and there. No. I ask back, how they want it to be made.
  Shall I put ice in it, large or small beer, etc. At this point they start to become
  more confident, and I even hold the glass, ready to pour the stuff in it. But before
  that, I ask them, if they would like anything else, something harder drink, ect.
  Playing with their head. They getting even more confident.


  And at the last moment, I ask them for their ID. It is always amazing to see their
  big smile disappear. Some try to act cool, and convince me that they can drink,
  but no ID, no serve.


  People say that I am the asshole, because I was underage too, and tried to pull
  off these stuff. To be fair, I did do that, but I just don''t like kids in general.
  Also don''t want to get into trouble for serving alchol to underage people, and
  want to have fun while working.


  So reddit, Am I the asshole?'
