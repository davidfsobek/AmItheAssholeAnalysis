selftext: "With winter coming up I was talking with my wife about my grandmother.\
  \ She lives in the middle of nowhere and he health has been declining of the years.\
  \ So I wanted to bring my grandmother into my home for the winter but only before\
  \ it is suppose to start snowing ( she has told me she doesn't want to live with\
  \ us). My grandmother's house wouldn't even be considered habitable by most standards.\
  \ Large portions of the house the ceiling is falling down and two rooms you can\
  \ even see outside. \n\nThe thing is my wife hates my grandmother with a passion.\
  \ My grandmother is very opinionated and isn't afraid to speak her mind (which even\
  \ bothers me sometimes). However, that comes out a lot as \"talking shit\" to my\
  \ wife. But honestly I believe she doesn't mean to hurt my wives feelings. It will\
  \ be things like \"I don't think marijuana can be medication\" and \"Don't you ever\
  \ cook nice dinners?\" (My wife usually only makes a main dish.) \n\nSo my wife\
  \ blew up yelling \"I don't want that old bitch here!\" I admittedly lost my temper\
  \ and said \"I think you need to find someplace to stay if you don't want to be\
  \ around her because I can't leave my grandmother stranded if the snow gets bad.\"\
  \n\nMy mother (part owner of the house) said I was being an asshole even though\
  \ she agrees with me that we should move my grandmother in with us temporarily.\
  \ She thinks my wife will come around if we keep trying to talk it out. My wife\
  \ is a very stubborn person and will never change her mind. AITA?\n\nEdit: I am\
  \ not kicking my wife out. Only stating my grandmother is coming and if she can't\
  \ handle it (two or three months) she should find a place to stay.\n\nEdit: I am\
  \ now a bigger asshole for realizing that I was the asshole in this situation."
