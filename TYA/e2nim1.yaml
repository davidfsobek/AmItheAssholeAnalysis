selftext: "In our cafeteria there was this lunch lady that often gave black kids extra\
  \ food / free food. For example when it came to fries she would always give more\
  \ to back students. And in general is way nicer to them.\n\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just\
  \ me I heard from other black students bragging about how she gave them food for\
  \ free. \n\nI found this really unfair and racist, so I reported her to the university.\
  \ No one did anything then I shared it in SGA and after that she was transferred\
  \ off campus to our satellite university. She now has to commute an extra 50 minutes\
  \ to work.\n\nSince then me and any student who supported her getting in trouble\
  \ has been labeled an asshole. I haven\u2019t been singled out it\u2019s mostly\
  \ the black in the sga. But still I feel like I did the right thing and now I\u2019\
  m being punished."
