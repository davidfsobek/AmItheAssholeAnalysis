selftext: "My son (12) has been addicted to all kinds of instant noodles lately. He\
  \ eats them all the time at home and he says he eats them at school for lunch sometimes\
  \ too. My son eats healthily otherwise and plays sports, but I don\u2019t want him\
  \ to consume that empty calorie junk anymore. I talked to my wife about this. At\
  \ first, she didn\u2019t think this was such a big issue, but I successfully convinced\
  \ her to not buy instant noodles anymore. \n\n\nI told my son that there would be\
  \ no more instant noodles in this house after he finishes this package. He got mad\
  \ and said he was saving me money eating this. I told him about the unhealthiness\
  \ of instant noodles and why it\u2019s terrible for growing boys. He said he\u2019\
  ll just buy more at school to make up for it then. I just hope he\u2019ll be sick\
  \ of it soon."
