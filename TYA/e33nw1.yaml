selftext: "My sisters boyfriend came over for thanksgiving. Me and this guy both get\
  \ along great we both served in the Navy, he left and now works as a regional manager\
  \ for banks. \n\nBefore thanks giving too we been playing the new modern warfare\
  \ together as well. We were talking about politics and he said that he was pro life.\
  \ \n\nI said that its tough that he was able to overcome my sisters past abortions\
  \ ( I don\u2019t remember the wording it was more natural in person) And he was\
  \ like what abortions.. I don\u2019t know I thought she told him before?? They later\
  \ talked and he got pissed and he left and went back to Virginia.\n\nMy family absolutely\
  \ hates me rn, how was I supposed to know?? My sister told me they share everything,\
  \ and in general my sister when she got her abortions it wasn\u2019t like this hush\
  \ family secret she even posted on Instagram about it last year about speaking out\
  \ in support of women\u2019s reproductive rights that she is proud of hers.\n\n\
  Now my family is hating the fuck out of me, sister won\u2019t even talk to me. My\
  \ dad said I ruined it, that my sister is 31 and it\u2019s already tough for her\
  \ dating and that I should not remind guys of her mistakes from her past? I can\
  \ see if she was secretive but again she bragged about it."
title: AITA for telling my sisters boyfriend that she has had multiple abortions when
  she bragged about them last year??
