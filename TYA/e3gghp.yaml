selftext: "My sister and her husband passed away in a car accident when their daughter\
  \ was 2. I was her only living relative and I got custody of her. \n\nShe is 10\
  \ now. She has always called me Aunt X. And everytime I go to a meeting or function\
  \ at school, I always refer to myself as Lucy's aunt. \n\nThe school has planned\
  \ for a Career's day next week. She asked me to come and speak. Tonight, I was practicing\
  \ in front of her and asked her what she thought. \n\nIt went like, \"Hello everyone.\
  \ I am Lucy's Aunt. My name is X... \". \n\nAfter I was done, she asked me if I\
  \ can introduce myself as her mother. I was a little blindsided. I was just like\
  \ blinking and staring at her cuz I didn't know what to say. She also said that\
  \ she wanted to call me mom from now. \n\nI just hugged her and then said something\
  \ along the lines of \"Honey. You know I love you. But I am not your mother. <my\
  \ sister's name> is. And just because I am not your mom doesn't mean I love you\
  \ any less. She loved you so much and I don't think she would want you to call me\
  \ mom.\" \n\nThen she started crying and saying it was unfair and went up to her\
  \ room. I went up after sometime and had another chat with her. She is adamant that\
  \ she wants to call me mom. I just hugged her, told her I loved her and then said\
  \ I will think about it. \n\nBut, honestly? I don't think I can. I love her to bits.\
  \ I love her like my own daughter. I love her enough that I am not planning to have\
  \ any kids. But that doesn't change the fact that she isn't is my daughter. My sister\
  \ and BIL loved her to bits. If they hadn't died, they would have been such wonderful\
  \ parents. \n\nTo me, Lucy calling me mom is like slapping my dead sister in the\
  \ face. I remember when Lucy was really small, she called another woman Ma and my\
  \ sister called me crying (She knew she was being stupid but she was still hurt\
  \ and couldn't help it). \n\nAfter a few days, I am planning to tell Lucy that she\
  \ can't call me mom because I am not her mom. \n\nI was telling my fiancee and some\
  \ friends, they all think I am being unreasonable and this is going to only hurt\
  \ Lucy. \n\nSo, reddit. Am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: Thank you guys. Lot of people\
  \ helped me sort through my feelings. Adopted children, step parents and children\
  \ who have lost their parents personally messaged me their experiences. They all\
  \ helped me immensely. \n\nThough I still need some more time to adjust to \"mom\"\
  , I will talk to her tomorrow and let her know that she can call me whatever she\
  \ wishes. I would prefer mum or mummy instead of mom (for now, at least). \n\nThank\
  \ you guys. \n\nI couldn't respond to everyone. Sorry about that. But I read almost\
  \ all of them. \n\nHave a nice day, people. Warm hugs to everyone."
