selftext: "My wife and I have always stressed the importance of school, and we were\
  \ lucky enough to be able to put away a considerable amount of money towards out\
  \ kids' education. The deal with our kids was that we would pay for four years of\
  \ undergrad, and as much post-grad school that their tuition fund could cover, which\
  \ is most of it. \n\nOur two oldest took advantage of this fully. My oldest (29M)\
  \ had his undergrad paid for, and most of his medical school. Our middle (25M) is\
  \ currently working on his PhD, also paid for. \n\nOur youngest (23F) has been more\
  \ difficult. In her third year of undergrad she nearly flunked out due to mental\
  \ health issues, and has since been at school part-time, and as a result she will\
  \ be finishing her degree in 6.5 years instead of 4.  She is currently in the middle\
  \ of her fifth year. \n\nBecause of this extra time, her need to repeat courses,\
  \ and the extensive amount of therapy she has needed, her undergraduate degree is\
  \ costing us almost $25,000 more than her brothers. We have told her that because\
  \ of this, we will be cutting her tuition off after this semester, and the rest\
  \ of her funds will be available if she chooses to get her Masters degree or her\
  \ PhD, just like her brothers. \n\nShe says this is completely unfair, and that\
  \ she will have to take loans out, but since she has a full-time job I don't think\
  \ her loans will be extensive. I don't think it's unreasonable to ask a 23 year\
  \ old to pay for her own school. I think this is fair, since we are honouring the\
  \ agreement that has always stood, and the rest of the money will be available for\
  \ her if she needs it. \n\nShe hasn't spoken to us since, and texted us that she\
  \ will be working over the holidays and therefore will not be able to come home\
  \ for Christmas, which is breaking my wife's heart. My sons are telling me I should\
  \ just pay for her school, but I don't want her to think that withholding visits\
  \ is an appropriate way to get what she wants. \n\nAITA?"
