selftext: "Sorry if it has a lot of error, English is not my first language.\n\nA\
  \ little background. I live with my girlfriend in our own house. We have been together\
  \ for around 6 years so we can say that it\u2019s a very stable relationship. We\
  \ also have good jobs so we are also stable in that aspect.\n\nMy sister has a little\
  \ daughter ( 5yo ) and we often take care of her when my sister and his husband\
  \ can\u2019t. Like when they are on a travel or something. Both I and my girlfriend\
  \ love my niece, we love to be with her and take care of her.\n\nAnd this past week\
  \ we had to take care of her because his parents were having a little vacation with\
  \ their in laws. But before they arrived they suffered an accident and both died.\
  \ Like you can imagine this was devastating for all of my family. I hasn\u2019t\
  \ been easy, specially because I had to tell my niece what had happened.\n\nNow,\
  \ she is staying at my home for now. I thought that this would only be temporal,\
  \ until we figure out what we are going to do with her. But when I bring up this\
  \ topic with her grandparents they all thought I was going to adopt her. Because\
  \ the thing is that the only sibling of my sister is me and his husband didn\u2019\
  t have any siblings, and both my parents and my sisters in-laws are to old to raise\
  \ a child.\n\nAn look, I and my girlfriend both love my niece. But the thing is\
  \ that we are not sure if we want or can raise a child ( financially we can but\
  \ we don\u2019t know if we are ready ). We had thought about having kids but not\
  \ now. And it\u2019s kinda difficult to suddenly have to raise a child like your\
  \ own. There is a big difference between taking here the weekends and raising her.\n\
  \nI talk to some of my friends and they said that a possible solution was to put\
  \ her into adoption or foster care. But all of my family is against this, saying\
  \ that I\u2019m \u201Cbetraying my sister\u201D. And in a way I feel like I\u2019\
  m being a piece of shit for even thinking this but I also think I\u2019m not ready\
  \ for this."
