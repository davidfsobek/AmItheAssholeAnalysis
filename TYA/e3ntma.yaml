selftext: "Hi reddit. My husband and I were eating at chick-fil-a with our two sons.\
  \ I\u2019m pregnant and just getting out of the first trimester so my stomach is\
  \ still a little sensitive. We sit down and this woman a few tables away looks like\
  \ she\u2019s on a date. She\u2019s a nurse and is telling story after story of really\
  \ disgusting medical procedures and things going wrong in the OR. Our food gets\
  \ to the table and I take a bite of my sandwich and she starts talking about a patient\u2019\
  s stomach filling up with poop. I lose it. I sprint to the bathroom and puke. My\
  \ dinner is ruined. While I\u2019m in the bathroom my husband politely (he doesn\u2019\
  t have a mean bone in his body) asks her to talk about something else because I\u2019\
  m pregnant and she made me sick. I get back to the table to let my kids and husband\
  \ finish eating. While I\u2019m waiting, she\u2019s whisper yelling about inserting\
  \ 5 feet of something into a patient and another patient bleeding out. My stomach\
  \ turns and I end up running out of the restaurant puking. My husband gives the\
  \ woman a look like \u201Cyou said you were going to stop talking about this\u201D\
  \ and she says \u201Cwell I was whispering. That\u2019s why we chose chick-fil-a\
  \ and not ruby tuesdays.\u201D Which I don\u2019t understand because the restaurant\
  \ was packed with children. We ended up leaving and the woman continued talking\
  \ the entire time we were there. The guys she was with didn\u2019t say a single\
  \ word the whole meal. We\u2019re we wrong?\n\nEdit: moving tables wouldn\u2019\
  t have helped. We could hear her from the play place. Her \u201Cwhispering\u201D\
  \ was louder than anyone else\u2019s normal talking."
