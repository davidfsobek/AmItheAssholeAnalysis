selftext: "My wife and I have been trying for a kid for a year and a half. It has\
  \ been harder than we thought it would be (especially considering her 2 sisters\
  \  got pregnant very easily) and she has had 2 miscarriages that have been really\
  \ heartbreaking for us. I can also tell they have put a lot of stress on her. \n\
  \nWe have a vacation planned to Costa Rica from December 12-December 23. My mom\
  \ is Costa Rican and my aunt owns a big house there that is a 5 minute walk to the\
  \ beach. We were planning on spending 5 days at a resort and then 5 days with my\
  \ aunt. My mom and older brother will also be going to Costa Rica for a few days\
  \ so it would be a big family early Christmas celebration with my Costa Rican family.\
  \ My wife has never met my Costa Rican side of the family so we were looking very\
  \ excited for this vacation and also thought it would be a good time to destress,\
  \ take a break from our conceiving struggles and enjoy the warm weather (we live\
  \ in Michigan) \n\nWe just found out she was pregnant 2 days ago and of course we\
  \ are ecstatic, but also a little cautious considering her 2 past miscarriages.\
  \ However my wife has been freaking out and she wants to cancel our trip because\
  \ she doesn't want to do anything that would but our baby at jeopardy. She says\
  \ that she needs to be home and in a familiar environment and that she can't risk\
  \ length plane travel and being in a \"3rd world country\" on her baby's health\
  \ and safety/ \n\nI think this is absolutely ridiculous. I've done research there\
  \ is no evidence that plane travel has a negative affect on a fetus's health and\
  \ we even got a  few vaccines as a precaution for out trip, even though I didn't\
  \ think we needed it (I have been to Costa Rica multiple times without getting any\
  \ vaccines) We're going to be in a resort and with my family for the whole trip.\
  \ There is no risk. My wife is not listening to any of my reasoning and is just\
  \ insisting that she can't put herself through the stress of worrying about her\
  \ pregnancy and would just rather stay at home.\n\nI do admit I got a bit annoyed\
  \ and said that if she doesn't go I'm not going to waste all the money and I would\
  \ go without her She then got mad at me and said that she can't believe I would\
  \ even consider leaving my pregnant wife alone. This is just completely ridiculous.\
  \ I don't even have anyone to talk to about this because my wife refuses to discuss\
  \ our pregnancy struggles with anyone in my family. \n\nAITA here?"
