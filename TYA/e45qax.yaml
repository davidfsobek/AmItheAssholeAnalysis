selftext: "I\u2019m due in February with my daughter. My husband has been very lenient\
  \ on the name because he understands how hard pregnancy is. \n\nWe are both from\
  \ India and so I wanted to name our daughter Neelakshi, an Indian name meaning blue-eyed\
  \ girl. We\u2019d call her Nikki for short. \n\nWhen I told my husband this he was\
  \ taken aback but ambivalently accepted it. When I decided to tell all our family\
  \ at Thanksgiving they were very disapproving, saying how I was setting her up to\
  \ be misspelled, mispronounced, and made fun of for life. \n\nBut I\u2019ve always\
  \ wanted to name my first daughter Neelakshi, though now everyone is mad at me over\
  \ it. \n\nWIBITA for naming my daughter Neelakshi?"
