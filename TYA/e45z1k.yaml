  \ this morning asking me if everything was ok. I said yeah he asked me why I didn\u2019\
  t go to the party. I told him because he didn\u2019t invite me. He says he\u2019\
  s talked about the party for weeks in front of me and I knew I was invited. I told\
  \ him that he personally texted others about it and asked them if they could help\
  \ set up or bring stuff. He didn\u2019t reach out to me to personally invite me\
  \ or ask me to help in anyway so I figured I wasn\u2019t invited. He told me he\
  \ feels like I\u2019m being childish about the whole thing? Our other friends agree\
  \ with him and say I\u2019m being vain and insane and an asshole for making this\
  \ about me."
