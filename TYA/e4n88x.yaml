selftext: "So background information, I'm 19, still live at home (senior year in high\
  \ school)\n\nA week ago, I ordered 50 trees because my favourite tree farm was shutting\
  \ down. When my mom found out, she got mad and hasn't talked to me since. \n\n-\
  \ I've ordered trees from there before and paid for everything myself.\n- The trees\
  \ are still very small (around 30 cm tall) and won't grow over 2 meters till I have\
  \ already moved out (I will take them with me)\n- The trees stay in containers so\
  \ they are easily movable.\n- My mom knew I was ordering trees, just not how many.\
  \ \n- I plan to place the trees in a part of the garden no one uses anyways. (I've\
  \ told my mom all this)\n- It wasn't a VERY expensive purchase, around $250 total\
  \ (including soil and containers)\n\nI didn't feel like I needed to ask my mom first,\
  \ because I'm an adult and can buy what I want. So, tell me, AITA reddit?\n\n\n\
  EDIT: Forgot to add, I already have 58 trees I bought a year ago, I did inform her\
  \ I was purchasing those and she was okay with that and helped me bring them home"
