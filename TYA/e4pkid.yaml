selftext: "I may have lost a friend over this, which sucks, but I honestly don\u2019\
  t believe I was in the wrong. (Obviously posting here so people can tell me if I\
  \ was though). \n\nMy girlfriend had a baby about a year ago. To be clear: I am\
  \ a woman and have 2 kids of my own so I know that losing weight post-baby is HARD.\
  \ \n\nOkay so my friend and I went out for drinks the other night and she was saying\
  \ her husband admitted to her that he wasn\u2019t attracted to her post-baby body.\
  \ (I\u2019m paraphrasing to make this short and he apparently said it more tactfully\
  \ than that - but the message was what it was).  \n\nHe also said that this lack\
  \ of attraction is the reason their sex life is now virtually dead. (Might seem\
  \ like TMI for some, but my friend and I have always shared a lot with each other\
  \ so talking about personal stuff is normal for us). Anyway she starts ranting and\
  \ telling me she thinks he is a piece of sh*t for saying that and she can\u2019\
  t believe how shallow and horrible he is. \n\nI was like...well, what do you think\
  \ he should do? She says he should love her unconditionally, which includes sex\
  \ even when she\u2019s not at a \u201C10\u201D. I said I had to disagree. He might\
  \ love her but people shouldn\u2019t have sex they don\u2019t want. I also said\
  \ that he had at least given her the gift of TRUTH so that she knows what the issue\
  \ is, when he could have  just avoided the topic. She was sooo angry with me. It\
  \ was bad. We went back and forth and, sadly, the conversation ended with her calling\
  \ me a terrible friend and person. \n\nWe haven\u2019t talked since. I\u2019m completely\
  \ gutted but, at the same time, I don\u2019t see how I\u2019m wrong for expressing\
  \ my opinion?? To be clear, I have never shamed my friend for her weight or anything\
  \ and I would never. But it just felt wrong to listen to her bash her husband (who\
  \ is also my friend) without at least trying to offer a different perspective. \
  \ \n\nOkay, now, in the spirit of candor, feel free to let me have it. AITA?\n\n\
  **Edit: I get it. People think I\u2019m TA. But is it really necessary to downvote\
  \ EVERY reply I make into oblivion? Glad I used a throwaway for this, sheesh. I\
  \ won\u2019t respond anymore since everything I say will get buried regardless,\
  \ but thank you to those who offered genuine feedback.**"
