selftext: "A friend recently approached me, she asked me if I could help her find\
  \ her sister that was adopted at birth, she had been looking for over 2 years. She\
  \ was denied a reunion from the parents of the adoptee. I was given her birth date,\
  \ birth name, hospital, and both birth parents name.\n\nI had done some looking\
  \ online and matched up the information to the parents of the adoptee via adoption\
  \ registries. The process took me weeks of my free time. \n\nI used this information\
  \ to track them down to their currently living address, and checkout out their social\
  \ media. I was able to find her sister who looked exactly like her if not a spitting\
  \ image, the Instagram and Facebook accounts were inactive for 3 years. \n\nI looked\
  \ over the Facebook timeline of the parents to find no pictures or any information\
  \ until I seen a photo of the sister\u2019s grave.\n\nShe died in a fatal car accident\
  \ 3 years ago, at only 16.\n\nI have yet to tell my friend because I wouldn\u2019\
  t want to let her know her sister she had been waiting to meet is dead.\n\nWould\
  \ I be the asshole if I tell her I couldn\u2019t find anything? I view it as saving\
  \ her a world of pain?\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nEdit INFO: \n\n\
  I\u2019m only friends with the person and have only gone to high school with them.\
  \ I wouldn\u2019t consider us close, but rather I was asked because I\u2019m great\
  \ with computers and researching.\n\nI don\u2019t want to be the message man of\
  \ such terrible news."
