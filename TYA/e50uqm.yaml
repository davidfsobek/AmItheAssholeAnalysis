selftext: "I had a MacBook pro, my parents bought it for me as a gift after I was\
  \ accepted to college. This was 6 years ago. \n\nI always babied that laptop, it\
  \ looked brand new and ran like new after 6 years. The only work I needed to have\
  \ done on it was a battery replacement after about 4 years.\n\nIt's the nicest thing\
  \ I have, hell, it's worth more than my car, worth more than anything else I own.\
  \ So yeah I take real good care of it. \n\nLast week, my roommate had her niece\
  \ over for the weekend, and they were hanging out in the living room while I worked\
  \ at the kitchen table in the kitchen. The girl was being bratty, whining about\
  \ stuff, and I went to get my headphones so I could have some music on while I worked.\
  \ I came back to the kitchen and when I walked in, the girl was throwing a total\
  \ fit, running in and screaming. Then before I could do anything, she grabbed the\
  \ table and pushed it over. I was shocked she was able to honestly.\n\nMy laptop\
  \ fell and landed on the corner. The screen shattered, the corner got all bent out\
  \ of shape. The hinge broke. I've since taken it to the Apple store and they've\
  \ confirmed it's basically destroyed. They recovered my data from the hard drive\
  \ but the laptop itself is gone.\n\nI asked my roommate to pay me back for it, and\
  \ she said she'd pay me back what laptops from my year are going for on eBay, $600,\
  \ so I can replace it\n\nI said that wasn't OK, with a laptop from eBay, you've\
  \ got no idea what you're getting, how well someone else took care of it. But I'd\
  \ assume most people didn't baby their laptops like mine. Also the ones on eBay\
  \ she was looking at were not specced out like mine, they were mostly base models\
  \ when mine had the top specs.\n\nPlus mine was sentimental to me, it was a gift\
  \ from my parents when I got into engineering school. It's the nicest thing I've\
  \ owned and I've had it with me all through school. It's not something that could\
  \ be replaced with a probably bashed up old laptop from eBay.\n\nI wanted her to\
  \ pay me for about what it originally cost, $2,700. Or at least $2000 so I could\
  \ be sure I was replacing it with a mac that's in good repair.\n\nShe said no way,\
  \ that was insane, it wasn't worth that anymore.\n\nAITA for not being happy with\
  \ what she offered, and wanting close to the new price?"
