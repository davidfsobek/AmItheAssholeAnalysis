selftext: "My girlfriend of 6 months and I were going to go out to dinner for her\
  \ birthday on Saturday. I made a reservation for a nice restaurant for 7:00PM and\
  \ we were going to meet there.\n\nI get there a few minutes before 7:00, and sit\
  \ at our table. At 7:05 I text her that I am sitting at the table at the back (hoping\
  \ she would give me an update) and she did not respond. At 7:10 I called her and\
  \ she did not pick up. At 7:15 I texted her to ask where she was. I called her a\
  \ few more times between 7:20 and 7:30 but she did not pick up, and then at 7:33\
  \ I texted her to let her know that I was leaving. I understand being late, but\
  \ the complete lack of communication is what made me decide that enough was enough\
  \ since I had no clue whether she would even come.\n\nShe responds at 7:38 saying\
  \ \"Oh my god! So sorry I was on the subway and it was delayed and I didn't have\
  \ service!!! I'll be there in a couple minutes\"... But at this point I was on the\
  \ subway leaving, and didn't see the message until about 8:00 when I was off the\
  \ subway, along with some missed calls from her.\n\nAt around 8:00 we finally speak\
  \ on the phone, and she is PISSED that I left. I explain that half an hour had passed\
  \ and I hadn't received so much as a text message, and it wasn't like I was going\
  \ to sit there all night. She said it was her birthday and I ruined it, and it's\
  \ not her fault the subway was delayed and there was no service. I highly doubt\
  \ the subway was delayed for a full half hour, that seems extreme.\n\nShe went to\
  \ her parents' house and we didn't see each other on her birthday. She still maintains\
  \ that I ruined her birthday. I've tried to apologize (even though I think it was\
  \ reasonable for me to leave at that point), but she is still mad at me. \n\nAITA?\n\
  \nUPDATE: the comments here have only re-inforced that I feel that I was right to\
  \ leave. 33 minutes is beyond excessive. I will retract the apology, since as people\
  \ pointed out I didn't actually mean it, and my girlfriend will have to either take\
  \ it or leave it. Hopefully she will apologize for her tardiness when she calms\
  \ down, and I will then take her out for a proper birthday dinner."
title: AITA for leaving my girlfriend's birthday dinner because she was more than
  30 minutes late?
