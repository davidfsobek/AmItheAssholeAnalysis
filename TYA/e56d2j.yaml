selftext: "\n\nMy boss just did one of those 23 and me tests and he bought one for\
  \ all 4 of his kids too. Well as it turns out his oldest daughter isn\u2019t his\
  \ daughter and this is how he found out. \nThe man is devastated. He\u2019s still\
  \ going to be this girl\u2019s dad obviously as he always has been but now he\u2019\
  s going to get a divorce and the woman he thought loved him for 30 some years gets\
  \ half of all of his stuff even tho she\u2019s been deceiving him for almost 26\
  \ years.\n\n\nSo we\u2019re at work and he kind of brought it up and just was like,\
  \ \u201CIf I could go back and do things different I probably should have just tested\
  \ my kids on the sly and then all of this bullshit might have been avoided.\u201D\
  \ \n\n\nI have 3 kids with my wife and they\u2019re all under 5. This whole situation\
  \ has made me a little paranoid not going to lie. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019\
  s because I\u2019m directly seeing this man\u2019s life unravel in front of me every\
  \ work day or what but I\u2019ve been debating on DNA testing my kids. \n\n\nWould\
  \ DNA testing my kids without telling my wife make me an asshole? \nI don\u2019\
  t distrust my wife at all but this guy\u2019s wife also was like a Betty Crocker\
  \ wife, head of her church type lady so my boss for sure didn\u2019t distrust her\
  \ either. And it turned out that the oldest\u2019s biological dad is a deacon at\
  \ their church where his ex wife had worked for 20 years. \n\nMy wife and I have\
  \ been married for 10 years and I know if I told her I was going to do this she\
  \ would be pissed. Like I said, I pretty much doubt the tests would come back not\
  \ mine but just watching this all go down is weighing on my mind."
