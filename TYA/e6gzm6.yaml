selftext: "My stepdaughter is very allergic to dogs. She's asthmatic, and living in\
  \ a house with them is making her breathing problems worse. She's been hospitalised\
  \ twice in 6 months, and 5 times this year. We've tried everything, from keeping\
  \ the dogs as away from her with air purifiers to sectioning off areas of the house.\
  \ Nothing has worked.\n\nAllergy shots aren't an option for medical reasons. BM\
  \ got the judge to agree that she can't live in a house with dogs, and it is abusive\
  \ and harmful. It could literally kill her. We would legally be charged with her\
  \ death if we keep the dogs and the worst happens.\n\nMy two dogs and my husband's\
  \ dog are our babies. My husband is willing to re-home his dog, but I can't do it.\
  \ They're 4 and 6 and won't be able to be adopted. They will be put down if I surrender\
  \ them. I'm sobbing just thinking about it. We just had a baby, so me moving out\
  \ with the dogs isn't really an option. \n\nWe've had to settle on moving to every\
  \ other weekend with my husband taking SD to a hotel for now. I feel horrible about\
  \ this but I don't know what option we have. I can't risk my dogs' lives, and I\
  \ can't risk my stepdaughter's life. BMs friends and family are gloating that they\
  \ were right to tell BM that 50/50 was just a temporary inconvenience she'd have\
  \ to deal with. DH is incredibly down about this and feels like he's abandoning\
  \ SD. I'm trying to justify it by reminding myself that we live two hours away,\
  \ so by the time SD was school age, someone would need primary custody anyway, but\
  \ it's not helping.\n\nEdit so that I'm not \"arguing in the comments\": \n\nWe\
  \ didn't know SD existed when we married, and paternity wasn't confirmed until she\
  \ was a little over a year old. BM was basically a friend with benefits. I did not\
  \ go into marriage knowing I had a stepchild or would be a stepparent.\n\nShe was\
  \ hospitalised 5 times this year, which I'll admit was a lot. BUT, we didn't know\
  \ exactly why. The first time, we just thought it was a bad attack. BM started screaming\
  \ about the dogs, but the allergy wasn't fully confirmed, and I'm not going to immediately\
  \ put down my pets on the word of a stranger who has every reason to lie. After\
  \ visit 2, we confirmed the allergy, and we were making steps to reduce allergens\
  \ AS RECOMMENDED. After visit 3, we doubled down and tried making the dogs outside\
  \ dogs, but it didn't help and wasn't viable as they bark. After visit 4, the court\
  \ summons happened. Visit 5 is very recent."
