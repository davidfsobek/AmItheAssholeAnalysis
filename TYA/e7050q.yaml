selftext: I ordered 140 documents online to be printed at Office Depot. The order
  was supposed to be at the customer service desk, not the print center. I received
  a text that it was ready. I arrived, it was not at CS counter. I went to the print
  center. The clerk was helping someone and she said she would be with me shortly.
  after 15 minutes I interrupted her and asked her if my already paid for order was
  back there. she told me to wait. I finally got a manager and he interrupted her.
  they found it under the counter. My wife said I should have waited. AITA?
title: AITA for getting huffy with the clerk at Office Depot because she kept asking
  me to wait?
