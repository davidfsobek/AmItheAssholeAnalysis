selftext: "My friends and I have a tradition of playing poker after Christmas and\
  \ I am usually hosting. New for this year is that my girlfriend has moved in with\
  \ me. The poker night gets loud, involves quite a lot of beer, and continues until\
  \ 4-5 in the morning so it wouldn't really work if she is home. I asked her if she\
  \ could go stay with her parents for one night but she was reluctant to do so. Now\
  \ it seems like we will cancel poker night this year. \n\nI think I would stay out\
  \ of the apartment if she had something similar so I was a bit surprised when she\
  \ declined. Am I the asshole for asking?\n\nSome relevant info:\n\n\\- We are both\
  \ just over 30 yo. \n\n\\- My group of friends are from \"back in the days\", and\
  \ we almost only get together for poker night. They all live elsewhere which is\
  \ why I need to host. \n\n\\- Her parents live in a suburb 30 min away. She gets\
  \ along great with them so no issue there."
