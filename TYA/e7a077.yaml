selftext: "My fiancee and I have known each other for 14 years, almost half of our\
  \ lives really. We dated on and off in between those years. I never stopped loving\
  \ her.\n\nWhen she was 24, she got married to her boyfriend of 1 year, this great\
  \ guy who she seemed to be really in love with. Of course, I was devastated, because\
  \ I always thought she\u2019d end up with me. Nevertheless she invited me to the\
  \ wedding as a close friend, and I attended. The wedding was a small, intimate occasion.\
  \ She was so emotional during the vows, she was crying all these happy tears. I\
  \ still remember how she looked at him\u2014like he was the only person in the world.\
  \ I remember thinking that she used to look at me that way.\n\nThe whole day was\
  \ really bittersweet. I was genuinely happy that she had found love and happiness.\
  \ It didn\u2019t last, though. They were in a car accident just a month after the\
  \ wedding, and he died at the scene. She became a widow at just 24.\n\nThen, 2 years\
  \ later, we rekindled our relationship. We got engaged a couple of months ago and\
  \ are getting married in the spring. Yesterday I went into her office (where she\
  \ keeps her wedding \u201Cmood board\u201D) for something unrelated, and noticed\
  \ that she had pinned a cropped picture of her outfit at her first wedding under\
  \ the headline \u201Cjewelry\u201D. She was wearing this diamond necklace with matching\
  \ earrings.\n\nIt really didn\u2019t sit right with me, so I asked her about it.\
  \ She said that yes, she was planning on wearing that set of jewelry as part of\
  \ her reception outfit (not ceremony) because it just \u201Clooks better with the\
  \ dress\u201D. I told her that out of ALL the jewelry she owns, why she has to pick\
  \ the ones that she wore at her first wedding? She gave me the same \u201Cit fits\
  \ better\u201D excuse.\n\nAITA if I put my foot down on this? It just really bothers\
  \ me knowing that there\u2019s this connection between her first wedding at OUR\
  \ wedding.\n\nEDIT: She is 29 now, its been 5 years since her first wedding. We\
  \ started dating 2.5 years ago."
