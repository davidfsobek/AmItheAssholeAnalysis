selftext: 'English is not my native language. okay, so when my son was 13 I and my
  wife were going through a NASTY divorce. for whatever reason, he began to Hate me.
  calling me names saying he hates me, breaking my valuables. when the divorce was
  finalized he didn''t want to stay with me and choose to live with his mom. a year
  after the divorce was done, my ex remained to a man with a daughter named K. that''s
  the last time I had contact with him until now


  when my son was 19 he called me saying that he would like to live with me because
  his mother is playing favorites with K. he told me that his mom would pay much more
  for K''s activity and gifts and that she stopped paying for his college saying that
  she needed the money for K''s college in the future. I said no because he never
  wanted contact with me before. and he begged me saying he can''t pay for college
  anymore and now he is working for minimum wage and she gonna kick him out soon so
  he will be homeless.


  I still said no. now he is spamming my messages.


  AITA


  edit: it seems I have been the asshole. I will try to contact my son to see what
  il do.


  final edit: holy sh\^t I reread the story and I acted like an Sh\^t head. I can''t
  let him be homeless. I will talk to him to see if he would want to live with me
  for minimal rent. I thank you all for kicking some sense into me.'
