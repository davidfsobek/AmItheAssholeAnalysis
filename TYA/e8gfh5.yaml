selftext: "TL;DR : Son keeps smoking weed, I keep catching him. He no longer hangs\
  \ out with friends. Does good in school despite smoking. \n\nThis is a long story.\
  \ The first time anything had happened with my son was when he was caught at a party\
  \ drinking and had to go to a substance abuse program after blowing a .076 BAC.\
  \ This was beginning of sophomore year (high school). My wife and I had let him\
  \ off easy, trusting that he would not do this again. We talked about how it\u2019\
  s wrong to drink at this age and he seemed to fully understand and cooperate with\
  \ us, so there was no punishment. \n\nFast forward to January of his sophomore year,\
  \ I had found weed ash outside of his window on the snow the morning after he hung\
  \ out with a couple of friends. I took his phone and he wasn\u2019t allowed to play\
  \ xbox or meet with his friends for about a month. At that point, I decided to start\
  \ randomly drug testing him. \n\nSome time after he was ungrounded, he went on an\
  \ overnight field trip for his business club, where he smoked with his friend and\
  \ I was able to find out after he tested positive for THC. He was once again grounded\
  \ and not allowed to do basically anything for about a month and a half, and because\
  \ of this he didn\u2019t go skiing much and after that the season was over. \n\n\
  He no longer hangs out with his friends because they all enjoy smoking when they\
  \ hangout. My son says he likes smoking and he doesn\u2019t experience any side\
  \ effects which is hard to believe. He has good grades in schools with only a couple\
  \ Bs from 9th grade and the rest are As. He seems to be really upset that he doesn\u2019\
  t hangout with his friends anymore as they don\u2019t include him in many activities.\
  \ I think it\u2019s for the better since he won\u2019t be ruining his childhood\
  \ through marijuana use. He is a very social person so it\u2019s kind of a bummer\
  \ he isn\u2019t with his friends. \n\nSo reddit, AITA for being too harsh?"
