selftext: 'I was discussing the upcoming year last night with my wife and the subject
  of her childhood friends wedding came up, the conversation started something like
  this (these aren''t exact words and I may not be conveying this perfectly, so bear
  with me):


  Her: "we don''t have much travel next year, except for my friends wedding"


  Me: "I didn''t think I was going to that, and I don''t want to go, do I need to
  go?"


  Her: "Yes, she''s family"


  Me: "No she''s not"


  Her: "She''s like family to me, and you need to come"


  Me: "I really don''t want to, I don''t know her that well, and every time I''m here
  for things like this I''m basically assigned to watch the kids (love my kids, but
  they can be a handful) while everyone else has a great time"


  The conversation then proceeded to get into a full blown argument where she said
  she came to all of my family''s weddings and I pointed out she hasn''t come to any
  of my very close friends'' weddings. Basically her argument hinges on her friend
  being family, which is hard for me to understand given she clearly didn''t care
  to come to my friends weddings (to be fair, I didn''t really care if she came as
  it''s not someone important to her and told her so, and she probably would have
  come if I had insisted, but she clearly didn''t want to).


  A bit of background information: I come from a large family (7 siblings including
  me) while she comes from a 2 child household. The friend in question grew up on
  the same block as my wife and they played together most days until around 8-10 ish
  (could be way off on the years, but the friends family moved away before the end
  of high school). They''ve stayed in contact since then, but mostly see each other
  around once a year.


  Relevant information:


  The last time our families got together I was stuck watching my screaming children
  in another room for 3-4 hours while listening to loud laughter floating in from
  the other room. I don''t want a repeat of that


  The wedding will be in another state, and I don''t want to pay \~$1,200 to fly 3
  extra people up to a wedding that has no real importance to anyone but my wife.
  I''d much rather stay home with the kids and have fun there.


  ATIA?

  Edit: Thanks everyone for the replies, I guess as is normal with reddit there are
  lots of people jumping to conclusions, nit picking wording, etc., but I appreciate
  the insight that some of you had.'
