selftext: "My son (24M) and his girlfriend (24F) have only been together for 6 months,\
  \ and she is apparently 4 months pregnant with his baby. They have actually been\
  \ friends since high school, and so my husband and I have known her for a few years\
  \ as well. \n\nShe is a lovely girl, but honestly she is not someone I had hoped\
  \ would be the mother to my first grandchild. First of all, she is a recovering\
  \ drug addict and alcoholic, and while she says she has been clean for 3 years,\
  \ a relapse is always possible. She only finished high school with her GED, and\
  \ she now works as a waitress full time. Her parents died years ago, so she is largely\
  \ on her own.\n\nOur family is considerably better off, and my son is joining his\
  \ father's business, meaning his salary will be quite high and will only continue\
  \ to grow. \n\nSince my son first told us she is pregnant, it can't escape my mind\
  \ that he may not really he the father, and that she picked him out of potential\
  \ others because he would be the \"best\" in terms of support. \n\nMy son is pushing\
  \ us to help her with some of her pregnancy expenses, and I told him we would under\
  \ the condition that she get a paternity test first. He completely blew up at that,\
  \ accusing us of disliking her (untrue) and not wanting to he grandparents (also\
  \ untrue). He says he loves her and trusts her and that he can't wait to meet his\
  \ baby. I get that, but I think he's being idealistic. If he wants our support,\
  \ we want a paternity test first. If the baby is truly his then we would be happy\
  \ to welcome her into our family and we would be happy to help her out. AITA?\n\n\
  Edit: there are 7k replies to this post, and over 200 private messages in my inbox\
  \ that I can't reply to. It's a pretty even mix of YTA and NTA, so clearly the only\
  \ thing everyone can agree with is that it's complicated. I've gotten messages to\
  \ kill myself, I've gotten messages calling my son an idiot, and I have gotten messages\
  \ from the MGTOW subreddit telling me that the girlfriend is clearly a lying sociopath.\
  \ I have also gotten a lot of messages from men who found out their child wasn't\
  \ theirs after several years, who wish they had found out sooner. \n\nIt's a lot\
  \ to read, and a lot to think about. Many people have called out my attitude towards\
  \ this girl and I'll be honest, it is making me think."
