selftext: 'My husband (30M) is defending his PhD in 1 week. He has been a PhD student
  for 8 years working for this. I (30F) live 3 hours from the location of his defense
  and don''t want to go because that would involve driving my kids (1 and 3) 3 hours
  (there is no one to take care of them but me). Paying $100+ for a hotel room. Not
  even getting to listen to his defense (toddlers cant sit that long silently). Going
  to his celebration party, but not getting to participate, since I''ll be taking
  care of the kids, while he is distracted by all the well-wishers. Paying another
  $100+ hotel stay. Then driving 3 hours back, with two unhappy kids. I dont want
  to drive that week then turn around and drive again for Christmas. I don''t want
  to spent money we dont have because of Christmas. I wont be able to listen to his
  defense of participate in the party, I might as well not be there.

  My husband is sad I don''t want to go. He wants me to support him. He wants to show
  off the kids. I think bringing the kids will be a distraction to him and my bad
  mood during the ordeal will be a distraction. He needs full concentration on the
  task at hand.


  EDIT: Thank you for all the replies. I have talked to my husband and I plan on dropping
  the kids off when daycare opens, drive to his defense, stay a little for the party,
  then drive back and pick up the kids before daycare closes. This will allow me to
  support him but not have to worry about the kids or hotel cost.'
