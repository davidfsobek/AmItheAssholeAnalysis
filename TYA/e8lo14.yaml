selftext: "Full disclosure, the event in question took place about 3 years ago, but\
  \ as I\u2019ve only been on reddit for a year, & my wife still brings it up every\
  \ now and again, including this past weekend at a big family get-together, I felt\
  \ it pertinent to ask. \n\nAt the end of each of my daughter\u2019s softball seasons,\
  \ the team always had a pizza party at one of the local pizzerias. Each family just\
  \ pays for whatever they order. No problem. My problem lies in being asked to contribute\
  \ $5 for trophies for a team that went 0-14. During this season, the girls were\
  \ ages 12-13, 7th grade I believe. \n\nI politely told the coach, who is a great\
  \ guy & a pretty good coach, that I just couldn\u2019t do it. It had nothing to\
  \ do with the money, it was simply principal. I feel we\u2019re doing our kids a\
  \ disservice by giving them awards for just simply going out and doing something.\
  \ Trophies are for the team that takes first place. Hell, I can even get behind\
  \ second place trophies. But trophies for not winning a single game? For just showing\
  \ up & trying? I couldn\u2019t, wouldn\u2019t, do it. I have no problem with the\
  \ party, with celebrating the season, but instead of awards maybe we could discuss\
  \ how not everything in life goes according to plan? How you need to get back up\
  \ and keep trying. You can have a bad season and still learn valuable lessons from\
  \ it. I explained to the coach that it would be disingenuous of me to participate\
  \ in that, given the values that I\u2019m trying to instill in my kids. He smiled\
  \ and nodded and of course all the girls (including my daughter) got trophies anyway.\
  \ He did tell me he understood where I was coming from, and there was no ill will.\
  \  \n\nBut boy oh boy was my wife pissed. Partly because I \u201Calways have to\
  \ be difficult\u201D, & partly because she was embarrassed that we were the only\
  \ parents that didn\u2019t throw in $5. Of course, as soon as one parent found out,\
  \ they all found out. And of course, no one asked me about it, they just asked her.\
  \ She understood the point I was making, but felt I should\u2019ve paid just to\
  \ make life easier or something. \n\nAnother disclosure, I was born with and have\
  \ lived my entire life with only one hand, so I don\u2019t get embarrassed easily.\
  \ I\u2019ve also grown rather thick skin growing up as the one handed kid, & frankly\
  \ don\u2019t really give a shit what all the other parents think. I realize that,\
  \ based on this, sometimes my actions do make me an asshole. I just don\u2019t think\
  \ this is one of those times. I\u2019ll also admit that I probably underestimated\
  \ how much focus this would put on my wife. Gossip doesn\u2019t phase me, but I\
  \ recognize that it is difficult for many people to cope with. But truth be told,\
  \ given the same decision, I\u2019d do it again. Like I said, it\u2019s principal,\
  \ & I\u2019m not too willing to budge on this one. But apparently I was an asshole\
  \ because it still gets brought up."
