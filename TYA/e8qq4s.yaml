selftext: 'Without getting into too much breakup detail, there''s a lot of complications
  here. We have a kid together, and I have lived with my ex''s grandparents for years.
  Her Grandpa died recently, but had already sold the house with intent to move. Now
  they''re moving somewhere else but have ~10 days before they can move in after the
  closing here.


  She broke up with me a couple weeks before her grandpa died (still trying to start
  healing tbh) and I just moved into my new apartment on Friday. She''s been helping
  me with the cleaning, moving, etc., even with a broken foot.


  I''m fine storing some of their shit at my place, as it''s actually bigger in terms
  of room space, but WIBTA if I don''t let them (ex, mother, grandmother, and my daughter),
  all stay with me for the next two weeks, and possibly end up homeless (obviously
  not my daughter or her mom) or having to pay >$1k to stay elsewhere?


  And WIBTA if I let them, even though it would be at least one violation to my new
  leasing agreement (pets people parking)? Halp.'
