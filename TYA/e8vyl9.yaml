selftext: "My girlfriend got a 24 pack of cookies for a cookie exchange party at her\
  \ work, her boss told her each person on the team brings in a dozen cookies. I thought\
  \ that since she only needed 12, I could at least have the others and she can put\
  \ them in a separate container. No. I was not to touch a single cookie because \u201C\
  they would notice one missing\u201D. I told her she could put them in another container.\
  \ Also no. And at that point I said to her, \u201Cyou\u2019re being a real fucking\
  \ cookie nazi!\u201D And then she got upset with me."
