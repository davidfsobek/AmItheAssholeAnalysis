selftext: "A lil background, I had a long time job which I was laid off from in 2018.\
  \ The person in charge of our department who made the call was someone I considered\
  \ a (work) friend and watched him climb the corporate ladder at the company and\
  \ was happy for him.  He laid me off a week before my wedding with absolutely no\
  \ warning, even worse his wife helped me pick out my wife\u2019s engagement ring\
  \ - when firing me he basically just said \u201CI am sorry, I know you have some\
  \ things going on\u201D. \n\nAnyways two years later I\u2019m doing alright but\
  \ struggling to re-enter the full time workforce, consulting and whatnot. What makes\
  \ things worse is mine is an industry where being unemployed or with large resume\
  \ gaps can be toxic to finding new work.\n\nA few days back I get a big setback\
  \ in the form of a job I didn\u2019t get that I had interviewed for three times\
  \ and was real close.  While processing the disappointment I see an instagram notification\
  \ that the aforementioned department head had tagged me in a photo on his page.\
  \ I check and it\u2019s a TBT of all of us at a work event.  Everyone is chiming\
  \ in like \u201Cawww, great memories\u201D etc.  However, I was seeing red...so\
  \ I replied:\n\n\u201CHey [boss] long time no talk, know what my fave memory at\
  \ [company] was?  When you called me into your office and laid me and my whole department\
  \ off A WEEK BEFORE MY WEDDING and while [a coworker] was on leave.  But hey I\u2019\
  m glad things are going well for you and all of [his old sub department which he\
  \ didn\u2019t make any cuts in at all].  Who\u2019s got it better than you?  Do\
  \ me a favor and keep me out of your feed, k? Thanks. Byeeeeee\u201D\n\nTurns out\
  \ he deletes the post, but I have be receiving mixed feed back on how I handled\
  \ it. Some thing it\u2019s great I stood up to him because he\u2019s a known sycophant\
  \ and it was a harsh dose of reality.  However others are calling it a dick move\
  \ so I\u2019m not sure, all I know is it made me feel just a little bit better after\
  \ having a bad day. \n\nNever the less,  AITA?\n\nEDIT:  As this picks up steam\
  \ wanted to clarify one thing. I had a team of three working under me and when I\
  \ caught wind some re-org may be happening I asked him if I should be dusting off\
  \ my resume in a jokey non serous way.  The company at the time was like 120 people\
  \ and he was directly above CEO so I knew he\u2019d be making the call.  Even though\
  \ I wasn\u2019t expecting an answer he emphatically said \u201Cno you guys are essential\u201D\
  .  I have good reason to believe he knew then and we even had dinner two days earlier\
  \ when he DEF knew."
