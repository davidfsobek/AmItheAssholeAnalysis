selftext: "I take the train a few times a week and I have to work while I do and the\
  \ nature of my work is I\u2019m constantly taking papers in and out of an awkwardly\
  \ shaped case. \n\nBecause of this I always spring for two seats, otherwise I\u2019\
  m either blocking the aisle or crinkling my papers trying to get them out from between\
  \ my knees or standing up literally every 60 seconds to get the bag from the overhead\
  \ compartment and exchange papers. \n\nI was boarding the train and I sat and put\
  \ my bag beside me and a woman approached me with a very young child (4ish) and\
  \ asked if I would switch seats to one a few rows up so her and her daughter could\
  \ sit together. \n\nI told her I was sorry but I had to stay where I was because\
  \ I was all set up for work. She said \u201CI hate to pull this card, but it\u2019\
  s a full train, and you really can\u2019t take up a seat with your bag.\u201D \n\
  \nI explained the situation and that I had two tickets. She said \u201CI need to\
  \ sit with my daughter. You don\u2019t need to have your bag right beside you.\u201D\
  \ And I reiterated \u201Cyes but I\u2019ve paid for this ticket\u201D and she said\
  \ \u201Cwell you can return it.\u201D\n\nBy this point we were holding up foottraffic\
  \ and a conductor asked what was going on and she said I wouldn\u2019t move my bag\
  \ and the conductor told me to move my bag saying it was a full train. I showed\
  \ her my two tickets. \n\nShe said \u201Cthis woman and her kid need to sit together\
  \ are you really going to die on this hill?\u201D\n\nAnd I basically said \u201C\
  there\u2019s no hill to die on, I have two tickets.\u201D \n\nAlright, so up to\
  \ this point, I think I\u2019m clearly in the right. But half an hour later the\
  \ mother and daughter passed me again. At the time, I thought they were going to\
  \ the bathroom. It didn\u2019t occur to me in all that time they wouldn\u2019t have\
  \ found a seat. \n\n45 minutes later we came to their stop and I realized they\u2019\
  d never found two seats together. \n\nSo now I really feel like a prick. Technically\
  \ I was in the right but morally I don\u2019t think I was. I don\u2019t know which\
  \ should win out, the technical or the moral. So... be blunt. AITA?"
