selftext: "So about 2 months ago we had new tenants move into the flat behind our\
  \ house, previously it was only myself and 3 other people using the WiFi. My parents\
  \ felt generous and gave the tenants our WiFi password, now this wouldn't be a problem\
  \ if they didn't connect 3 laptops and multiple phones and CONSUME the bandwidth\
  \ 24/7, literally all day every day.\n\nI'm an avid gamer and life was all good\
  \ before this but as soon as they began streaming movies, music and constantly downloading\
  \ massive files my gaming experience took a beating, unpredictable ping and low\
  \ download speeds were only the tip of the iceberg.\n\nAs a compromise I made them\
  \ able to access the internet for a full 18 hours each day and at about midnight\
  \ I'd have 6 hours to just enjoy myself and the internet would be back up by early\
  \ morning, I saw this as fairly reasonable and it only applied to the tenants. Now\
  \ they've come to complain to my parents that they'd like to always have internet\
  \ access and I literally don't understand, IT'S FREE WIFI and they aren't paying\
  \ a dime yet they complain that 18 hours a day of access isn't good enough for them.\n\
  \nMy parents think I'm the asshole here for this and i beg to differ, so Reddit\
  \ AITA  \n\n\nINFO : My parents pay for the WiFi, but I asked for them to get it\
  \ a while back."
