selftext: "So my (49M) wife\u2019s (48F)  birthday is close to Christmas, it was last\
  \ weekend, and she HATES everything. She hates jewelry, makeup, skincare stuff,\
  \ literally anything you\u2019d buy for a girl she hates. So over the years we\u2019\
  ve (me and my children) gotten her things like jewelry or something and she doesn\u2019\
  t wear it. So  this year I could not think of anything and got her  car mats customized\
  \ because she\u2019s always complaining about dog hair on her rugs in the car. She\u2019\
  s needed them for a while. I mean yeah it\u2019s a dumb gift but it\u2019s hard\
  \ to buy for her bc she doesn\u2019t like anything. Her package comes in the mail\
  \ today, she looks at it and starts SCREAMING at the top of her lungs. I kid you\
  \ not screaming. Crying, throwing a fit, stomping around. She runs up the stairs\
  \ and goes \u201CAFTER EVERYTHING I DO FOR YOU YOU GET ME A FUCKING GODDAMN CAR\
  \ MAT\u201D and is now sitting in her office literally sobbing. For context, this\
  \ year she got me a really nice present for Christmas: concert tickets for the Doobie\
  \ brothers with my sisters. She threw that in my face saying that she gets me such\
  \ nice gifts and how dare I get her a car mat. AITA?\n\nEdit: please see the most\
  \ recent comment."
