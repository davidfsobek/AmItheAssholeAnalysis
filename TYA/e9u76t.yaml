selftext: "A little over a month ago, my wife got upset with me for mistakenly assuming\
  \ her best friend was pregnant when in fact she just gained a bunch of weight, mostly\
  \ on her stomach area. \n\nAnyways, after that whole debacle that night, she just\
  \ texted me that she'd be staying with her best friend for a while to comfort her\
  \ and to be there for her. I said fine, I don't mind. And that to reiterate to her\
  \ best friend that I was sorry.\n\nIt's been a week after that night and she still\
  \ hasn't gotten back to my house. We did keep in touch though but she started to\
  \ respond less and less. Thanksgiving week came and she's still not back. Night\
  \ before Thanksgiving, she told me that it's best if we stay separated for a while\
  \ because she needs time to think and evaluate her life.\n\nI said fine, take as\
  \ much time as you need, and that I'd be here when she's ready to come back. I haven't\
  \ heard from her ever since until yesterday.\n\nShe sent me a handwritten letter\
  \ but I'm not going to type it all up because it contains a lot of private matter\
  \ and someone might recognise her handwriting. But the summary of it was that she\
  \ told me she's actually a lesbian and that the only reason she married me was to\
  \ take her parents off her back. Since we didn't really become sexually active when\
  \ we started dating, she figured she could tolerate the occasional sex with me,\
  \ which was once or twice a month. \n\nShe told me that she did somewhat love me\
  \ but the situation with her best friend was the last straw that made her decide\
  \ to leave me. It turns out, they were actually having an affair behind my back\
  \ this whole time. She said she'd stop by sometime this week to pick up her stuff\
  \ when I'm at work.\n\n After reading her letter, I texted her if she's going to\
  \ pick up her stuff, she needs to do it whilst I'm there. \n\nI'm sure she'd only\
  \ get What's truly hers but there's a part in me that's kind of angry at her and\
  \ doubt she'd only do what she said she'd do.\n\nWould I be the asshole for changing\
  \ all the locks to make sure she doesn't get into my house without me in it?\n\n\
  Edit: yes, the house is under my name. She moved in when we got married."
