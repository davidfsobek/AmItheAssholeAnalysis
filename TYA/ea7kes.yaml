selftext: 'So I live in a student house with 4 other people. We generally all get
  on, but one of them only really talks to a other guy in the house. A few nights
  ago I woke up at around to find my period had started and stained the sheets. I
  didn''t want to ruin the sheets permanently so I went and put them in the washing
  machine. A few minutes later I get a text from the quiet housemate saying that I
  shouldn''t be doing laundry because the noise of the machine wakes her up.


  The machine is in a room that is separated by a hallway from her room, and at my
  house the washing is done overnight next to my room and I can sleep through the
  noise fine (although I know I''m a heavier sleeper than some)


  I told her that I was sorry but I wasn''t going to let my sheets stain, and I would
  also have preferred not to be doing laundry at 1am.


  AITA for not waiting until a more reasonable time to do laundry?'
