selftext: "My brother\u2019s girlfriend (19F) slept with my brother (19M) in his room\
  \ last night. Those two, my parents, and I (16M) were all supposed to leave the\
  \ house to go on a trip by 7am. My brother woke up early and when it was 6am, he\
  \ told me to go wake up his girlfriend. By the way, this is only the third time\
  \ in my life that I saw his girlfriend because they go to school in another state,\
  \ but she has always been friendly to me. \n\n\nI went in his room and told her\
  \ to wake up. She didn\u2019t respond. There was some light peaking through the\
  \ window so I didn\u2019t turn on the light. I nudged her shoulder. Again, she didn\u2019\
  t respond. I told her to wake up again, louder this time. No response. She must\
  \ be a deep sleeper or had too much to drink last night. She was lying on her stomach\
  \ so I sat on her butt. There\u2019s a blanket between us and I only weigh about\
  \ 120 lbs. \n\n\nShe showed movement after I sat there for about 5 seconds and she\
  \ turned her head and shouted \u201Cwhat the fuck are you doing?\u201D I said \u201C\
  I couldn\u2019t wake you up the normal way\u201D and she said \u201Cget the fuck\
  \ off me you creep.\u201D I apologized and left the room. \n\n\nA few minutes later,\
  \ she told my brother \u201Cyour little brother tried to molest me.\u201D I wasn\u2019\
  t sure if she was joking, but her tone was pretty serious. I told her \u201CI just\
  \ needed to find a way to wake you up because you were sleeping like a pig.\u201D\
  \ I wasn\u2019t fat shaming. She\u2019s skinny too. She said \u201Cyeah right, how\
  \ did my ass feel?\u201D My brother told her \u201Ccalm down, don\u2019t pretend\
  \ you\u2019re not a super deep sleeper.\u201D \n\n\nShe went to get ready and my\
  \ brother apologized for making me wake her up and causing this quarrel. My parents\
  \ were getting ready in their bathroom during our argument. His girlfriend acted\
  \ more normal and friendly to me after we left the house. Maybe I shouldn\u2019\
  t have sat on her butt to wake her up?"
