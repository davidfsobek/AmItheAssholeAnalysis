selftext: "Edit: I realize the title and post do not match! It should be \n\nAITA\
  \ for wanting to put a stop to my son\u2019s Spider-Man obsession? \n\nI have a\
  \ 6 ( almost 7) year old son who is obsessed with Spider-Man. He\u2019s been like\
  \ this for a few years but It becomes more intense over time.  I can\u2019t remember\
  \ the last time he wore something that didn\u2019t have at least one thing Spider-Man\
  \ related whether it was a Spider-Man hat, Spider-Man shirt, wearing a spider man\
  \ costume under his clothes or literally just wearing a Spider-Man costume. As soon\
  \ as he gets home from school he changes into his Spider-Man PJs. Even when we\u2019\
  re going to a formal event he\u2019ll insist on wear a Spider-Man shirt underneath\
  \ his clothes. It\u2019s a little ridiculous. He is constantly watching Spider-Man\
  \ movies or cartoons. \n\nIt\u2019s gotten to the point where he literally acts\
  \ like he\u2019s Spider-Man. He will constantly climb onto things and do the Spider-Man\
  \ hand motion and sometimes yell out \u201CI\u2019m spider-man\u201D We went to\
  \ China for a trip recently and quite a few locals wanted to take pictures with\
  \ him. Apparently it\u2019s because he has very blonde hair which Chinese people\
  \ aren\u2019t used to and he is \u201Ccute\u201D but my son was convinced it was\
  \ because they thought he was Spider-Man. \n\nI understand he\u2019s just a kid\
  \ but I think he\u2019s getting a little old for this and think we should discourage\
  \ it. I work full time and my wife is home with him much more and she thinks it\u2019\
  s just adorable and I feel she has been actively encouraging this by buying him\
  \ so many Spider-Man related things and allowing him to dress up in his spider-man\
  \ clothes constantly. If I ever try and refuse to let our son wear them  she thinks\
  \ I\u2019m being mean and tells him it\u2019s fine. She thinks I\u2019m being an\
  \ asshole and acting so worked up about something so innocent and that he\u2019\
  ll grow out of it. But my logic is if we keep encouraging this obsession, how will\
  \ he grow out of it? I feel he\u2019s going to start to get teased for this soon\
  \ and that we should put a stop to it now. \n\nAITA here?"
