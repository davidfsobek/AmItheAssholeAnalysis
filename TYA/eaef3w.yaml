selftext: "Background is important:\n\nThe other day my bf asked me if I wanted to\
  \ split Disney+ with him and I said no because I really didn\u2019t think I\u2019\
  d have an interest in the service.\n\nHe ended up still wanting to get it and later\
  \ I asked if I can have his info. Keep in mind through my family I have given him\
  \ Netflix, HBO, and Hulu info. He said no because he asked to split it and I said\
  \ no. I guess I understand (even though If I was already buying something I\u2019\
  d let my s/o have it for free) BUT he\u2019s gotten other streaming services from\
  \ me. He says it\u2019s different because I\u2019m not the only actually paying\
  \ for them. So, if I think he should share his info with me because of all that\
  \ I\u2019ve shared with him AITA?\n\nEDIT: I know people seem to think I\u2019m\
  \ mooching off my family but I am a college student whose parents have streaming\
  \ services in the house and don\u2019t ask their kids to pay for it. I don\u2019\
  t think this is abnormal for someone my age."
