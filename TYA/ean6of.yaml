selftext: "Ok, so me and my girlfriend live about 100 miles away from each other.\
  \ On a Friday night we meet up at the halfway point, rent a hotel room, and go out\
  \ for a night of drinking. After an amazing night we both pass out. She\u2019s sleeping\
  \ HARD. I get up, take a shower, turn on the TV. I keep thinking she might wake\
  \ up before I hit the road, but she doesn\u2019t. I love this girl. And we kiiinda\
  \ have a 3-year plan. She got plastered last night and so I figured I would just\
  \ let her sleep. So I hit the road. I got a couple miles down the road. Stopped\
  \ at a gas station for some coffee and she calls. \nShe was SUPER upset that I left\
  \ without waking her up. She started crying and said I really hurt her feelings.\
  \  Being real emotional and, I felt, kind of irrational. So I turned around and\
  \ went back.  She seemed like she was still a little drunk. We ate, she sobered\
  \ up, we talked about it and I don\u2019t feel like I did anything wrong. \n\nShe\
  \ said I was the asshole because I just up and left without saying goodbye or waking\
  \ her up... when we live so far away from each other and may not see each other\
  \ again for a week. \n\nI don\u2019t think so, because I was just letting her sleep.\
  \ She was tired. So... Am I The Asshole??"
