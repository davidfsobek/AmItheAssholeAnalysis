selftext: "My sister had a miscarriage at 23 weeks pregnant due to some health complications\
  \ she had from a surgery a few years back. She does have another child who is a\
  \ fine healthy 6 year old boy and we were all excited when she broke the news of\
  \ her second pregnancy. Her and her husband are quite devastated over the miscarriage\
  \ as this was probably their last chance to have another child. Obviously we\u2019\
  re all devastated, but she recently sent us a text in our family\u2019s group message\
  \ that she would be holding a funeral service for the child this coming Friday.\n\
  \nThe problem with this is that the only time I can take off from work is vacation\
  \ time that my wife and I have already made a plan of going on a cruise this spring.\
  \ It\u2019s always been our dream to go on a cruise and after saving up for the\
  \ past few years and being very frugal with our money we finally have enough to\
  \ go on the exact cruise we\u2019ve always dreamed of. It comes complete with the\
  \ alcohol and food package, island excursions( there\u2019s 2 of them ) and a very\
  \ nice and large room with a massive king size bed. This is truly our dream and\
  \ I\u2019d really hate to ruin our vacation by missing this one day of work.\n\n\
  I did indeed bring this up to my boss after a little hesitation ( Older white male\
  \ who grew up in rural Kentucky) and he basically asked if I was serious and laughed\
  \ in my face over the idea of having a funeral for a miscarried baby. I\u2019ve\
  \ worked at this place for 15 years and i\u2019ve worked my way into a good position\
  \ and wouldn\u2019t be able to find a job anywhere near the pay and benefits I get\
  \ due to my criminal history. \n\nI know it seems quite messed up and it\u2019s\
  \ something my wife and I have been thinking about a lot, I love and support my\
  \ sister but I\u2019m just not sure if this would really be worth it for such a\
  \ silly event."
