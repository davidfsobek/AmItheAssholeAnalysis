selftext: "So, I\u2019m honestly at a loss with this one and just really need to see\
  \ if I\u2019m crazy or not. I\u2019ve recently started seeing someone casually for\
  \ the last two months or so, it\u2019s going really well and will hopefully lead\
  \ to something more serious. While I\u2019m still figuring out what I want with\
  \ this relationship, I\u2019m getting pressure from my flatmates to \u2018have the\
  \ talk\u2019 and \u2018establish what we are\u2019 simply so they can charge him\
  \ a weekly rent.\n\nHe comes over after 8pm and will either leave when I go to work\
  \ or have a sleep in and leave later, this probably happens 4 times a week, if that.\
  \ He\u2019s had 3 showers over the two months, 2 of which were with me. We either\
  \ get takeout or I\u2019ve eaten and he\u2019s eaten so I\u2019ve only cooked us\
  \ dinner once or twice in this time span too. So in essence he literally comes and\
  \ sleeps with me for the night then leaves in the morning, few things in-between.\
  \ Now keeping this information in mind, would you ask me to get a \u2018weekly or\
  \ monthly\u2019 rent off of him? This is literally what my flatmates are expecting,\
  \ him to pay $20 a week to stay with me. They are justifying it by saying \u201C\
  If you leave in the morning and come back in the evening you are living there\u201D\
  . I find this extremely embarrassing and humiliating behaviour and instantly said\
  \ there is no ways in hell I am going to ask the guy I\u2019m seeing to pay a fucking\
  \ weekly rent to come and see me. \n\nIs this normal behaviour? Am I completely\
  \ delusional for standing my ground on this matter and pretty much saying I\u2019\
  d rather move out than ask him to pay? Reddit, Am I the Arsehole for saying No to\
  \ this request which has now caused a huge fight within my home?  \n\nFew other\
  \ things to note \u2013 there are three of us living together, I\u2019m single the\
  \ other two are a couple. I pay more than 1/3 of the rent too, over $20 more a week\
  \ to be exact and I never miss any bills or rent payments. I\u2019m extremely clean\
  \ and always bring a good energy into the house because confrontation is my biggest\
  \ fear so I avoid it like the plague by being an angel and keeping the peace. \n\
  \nTD;LR My flatmates want my fwb to pay a weekly rent because he leaves in the morning\
  \ and comes back in the evening 4 times a week, so this means he\u2019s living with\
  \ us now apparently. I\u2019ve flat-out refused to do such an embarrassing thing\
  \ and now there is a lot of animosity in the house because of it.\n\nEDIT: I clearly\
  \ need to add info about the lease agreement, our names and signatures are all on\
  \ the agreement, they do not own the flat we simply rent it off a landlord. There\
  \ is no clause about guests, its at our discretion.\n\nEDIT 2: I shouldn't have\
  \ put 4 nights a week, because that is an exaggeration and each week it is different\
  \ - I'll stay at his or we'll go away but more often than not it is at least 3 nights\
  \ at mine.\n\nHoly heck Reddit, never did I think I was the asshole in this situation.\
  \ I thought it was normal to have the person you're seeing stay over, but clearly\
  \ 4 times a week is too much. I haven't taken my flatmates feelings into consideration\
  \ you're all right, I just assumed it was about money for them rather than invasion\
  \ of space by a stranger.  I am the asshole, thank you all for contributing your\
  \ opinions I'll be sure to take them on board and have a mature chat with the roommates\
  \ and sort some sort of arrangement that works for all involved."
