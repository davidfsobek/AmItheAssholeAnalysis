selftext: "My wife\u2019s currently 38 weeks pregnant for our second baby and the\
  \ due date is late December so really we\u2019re expecting any days now. \n\nLast\
  \ night while she was packing the hospital bag, I put my nintendo switch and the\
  \ charger in the bag. She looked at me so offended like I just sacrificed our first\
  \ born. She said \u201Cexcuse me?\u201D And I said \u201Cwhat?\u201D. She then started\
  \ berating me about not being presence and won\u2019t concentrate during the labor\
  \ but rather on the game. I said well we don\u2019t know how long she\u2019s gonna\
  \ be in labor for since for our first baby girl she was in labor for 40 hours. I\
  \ didn\u2019t leave her side at all for our first until the three of us could leave\
  \ the hospital and intending to do the same for our second. There will probably\
  \ be a lot of down time and it can be boring. Our daughter will be with her parents\
  \ so it\u2019s not like I have to watch her. I also said what\u2019s the difference\
  \ with playing games on my phone. And she said it\u2019s the intention and she left\
  \ the room. She\u2019s still giving me cold shoulder til now. \n\nSo reddit, AITA\
  \ for wanting to bring a game console while my wife is giving birth to our daughter?"
