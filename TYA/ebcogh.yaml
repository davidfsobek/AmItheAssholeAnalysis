selftext: "Sorry if writing gets confused, I'm really sleepy right now and can't sleep\
  \ because my mind keeps going around and around, so I just got up to type this out\
  \ and get it off my chest.\n\nI have worked very hard to create playlists for my\
  \ yoga classes with unique songs the other instructors don't use. So a new instructor\
  \ gets trial-hired at one studio I teach at, and she samples one of my classes.\
  \ So I thought I'd support her and go to one her classes. And then it happens. She\
  \ actually has one of my songs on her playlist. Coincidence? Not likely. She plays\
  \ it during savasana which is exactly when I had it playing in my class. So this\
  \ totally fucked with my savasana experience because she made it impossible for\
  \ me just to relax and not think about why she copied my song. I didn't know how\
  \ to deal with it so I let it go. But it just kind go nagged at me. \n\nSo I thought\
  \ I'd go to another of her classes. This time a different song that I used came\
  \ on and she quickly walked over to her phone and fast forwarded to the next song.\
  \ It was just the rhythmic intro but I recognized it in the first couple seconds.\
  \ And it wasn't just this. i have a phrase i use about wrapping up your rainbow\
  \ as a metaphor to encourage freedom and joy in the pose. Well, she used a different\
  \ cue, but it still used the phrase \"your rainbow\". So I confronted her after\
  \ clsss and said it's wonderful she felt so inspired by my music selection and cues,\
  \ butte would be more authentic in her teaching if she found her own unique voice.\
  \ And she just acted like it was all a big coincidence and then said, \"Awww, you\
  \ need a really sweet hug today, sounds like.\" And she kind of pouted her lips\
  \ when she said this. Totally condescending and passive aggressive. \n\nSo I arranged\
  \ for a meeting with the two studio owners. I told them what she did. They didn't\
  \ want to talk about her stealing from my playlist but didn't like the way she treated\
  \ me. She was on a trial probationary period and the owners agreed to facilitate\
  \ her off of the trial period and set her free. \n\nSo I felt happy about this because\
  \ usually I have history of not standing up for myself and asserting my voice and\
  \ this felt like a breakthrough. But then I started feeling bad about it. But if\
  \ she wasn't let go I know I'd still hold resentments at her and that has led to\
  \ trouble in the past with me, you know when things build up.\n\nAITA for telling\
  \ studio owners I wasn't sure I couldn't work around this person's energy anymore?"
