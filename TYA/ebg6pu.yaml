selftext: 'So I do what I can to cut down on creating dirty dishes where I can. One
  of the things I do is tear up food like chicken, steak, pancakes, whatever needs
  cutting to be eaten appropriately. Occasionally my girlfriend sees this and roll
  her eyes and offer to cut it for me using her own dirty knife, which I let her do.
  But if its on me I don''t bother, food doesnt taste differently because of how it
  was cut up.



  We just got done having breakfast where beforehand GF asked me to butter her toast
  while she ran to the bathroom. I did hers and then mine and tore both in half to
  add to the plates. When she saw this she suddenly got super mad and snapped at me
  and told me to use a knife like a grown-up. I tried explaining why I do it but she
  cut me off saying she knows already.




  So AITA for being innovative and cutting down on creating dirty dishes? Or is she
  TA for hating my creative solutions?



  *edit* for people asking, we have one of those rounded buttery spreading trowels
  that would have been more work to try and cut the toast with than it was worth'
