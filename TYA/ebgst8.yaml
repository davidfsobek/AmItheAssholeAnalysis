selftext: "A little background. I met a guy (\u2018Mark\u2019) at work many years\
  \ ago and we developed a pretty close friendship. I often met up with him and his\
  \ wife for dinners, movies, etc. and we frequently went to each other\u2019s houses\
  \ to hang out.\n\nI am a gay man and fairly late in life I came out to my family\
  \ and friends a little over four years ago. I came out to Mark at one of our dinner\
  \ meet ups and he seemed cool with it and accepting. However, after that day, he\
  \ never once tried to contact me to do anything social and all attempts to meet\
  \ up had to be initiated by me. He often had excuses about being busy and the couple\
  \ times we did get together, something just seemed off.  I eventually stopped trying\
  \ and we haven\u2019t spoken in over three years now. Over the course of my life\
  \ I have come to understand that most friendships are transient in nature but this\
  \ one got to me. It can\u2019t be a coincidence that this happened right after I\
  \ came out to him but I didn\u2019t want to be confrontational about it so I just\
  \ accepted it and moved on.\n\nHowever, every year I get a Christmas card from him\
  \ and his wife. It is the typical recent picture of them printed on a card with\
  \ a Christmas greeting. Nothing personal is ever written on it. I just received\
  \ the latest one and I realized that receiving the card makes me sad rather than\
  \ happy and serves as an annual reminder of the loss of our friendship.  I would\
  \ really rather not get them.  After Christmas is over this year, I really want\
  \ to send the card back to him with a note saying I prefer not to receive any cards\
  \ from him in the future.  WIBTA?  I\u2019d really like to get an outside perspective\
  \ on this.\n\nEdit: Hey everyone, I appreciate all the feedback.  I can see now\
  \ that I was making way too big a deal of this in my head.  In the future I will\
  \ just throw the cards away like any other mail I don't want to receive. Thanks\
  \ again for your perspectives."
title: WIBTA if I sent someone back their Christmas card and asked them not to send
  them to me anymore.
