selftext: 'Hello r/AmItheAsshole. Throwaway for obvious reasons. Back in September
  I made a custom mug as a birthday gift for my mom. When I went to pick it up at
  the local Walgreens, the girl (I''ll call her G) working there commented on my Rick
  & Morty shirt then we got talking. I was immediately into her but too afraid to
  ask her out, also wasn''t sure if she was just being nice. So I just leave feeling
  regret, but later I get a text from a unknown number, it''s G. She apologizes for
  contacting me like this & asks if I''d wanna hang out. Obviously, I''m down & couldn''t
  care less about how it happened. Flash forward to now & we''ve been dating for almost
  3 months, things have been great.


  This past weekend the two of us hung out with my older sister (I''ll call her S)
  when the subject of how we met came up. (Some context: Couple years ago S had stalker
  problem. She donated blood & a staff member lifted her info then used it to start
  harassing her on Facebook. Thankfully she never got hurt but did have to change
  her phone number & get a restraining order against the guy.) I fucked up, and never
  considered it might be a sensitive issue so when G starts I just let her. She left
  nothing out. I could see right away that S was upset, but she played it off & didn''t
  comment. As soon as G went to the bathroom S asks me if that was all true. When
  I said it was she tells me how that''s not OK & I need to report G to her manager.
  I try to downplay it but she''s not letting it go. She knows exactly where G works
  & I''m almost certain if I don''t do it, she eventually will. I haven''t mentioned
  any of this to G yet since I don''t want the two to argue. I''m considering it only
  because I feel like S will do it in a way that will get G fired. WIBTA if I report
  her?'
