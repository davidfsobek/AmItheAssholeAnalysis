selftext: 'My wife is pregnant with our daughter. Initially we were really happy and
  excited about it. But then, she starts acting like a nut job. She gets angry and
  irritated for small things, insults me when she doesn''t like the food I make, starts
  acting insecure and accuses me of losing attraction for her.


  For example, she wanted to eat chicken sandwiches for dinner last week. Well, I
  made chicken sandwiches. So she eats all the sandwiches, leaves me nothing and told
  me that they tasted like shit. I wasn''t pissed because she left me nothing. But
  if she didn''t like them, why did she have to eat everything? When I asked her this
  she told me that she was hungry. Ok fine. She does this every time. Eats everything
  I make and calls it shit. I don''t argue with her because I work for more than 80
  hours a week and I really want to have some peace when I''m home.


  So, yesterday, a random girl starts at flirting with me after the gym and asked
  me if I wanted to meet up with her for some drinks. I rejected her and told her
  that I was married. And when I got home, my wife started to hug me and apologise.
  When I asked her what happened, she told me that her best friend suggested a test
  for my loyalty. So they asked a mutual friend to flirt with me and asked me out.
  And I passed. Yay!!. I''m really pissed. I''m done with her antics. WIBTA if I ask
  her to move out?


  Edit: I don''t live in the USA. Please don''t discuss legalities based on the laws
  there.'
