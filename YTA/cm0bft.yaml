selftext: "I had a party at my house last night. I have an antique slot machine from\
  \ the 1940s that is in absolutely spotless and working condition in my living room.\
  \ My step grandma was a show girl she she got it while dating a count room guy prior\
  \ to meeting my grandpa.\n\nOver the years people have played it and maybe won a\
  \ few quarters here and there. Maybe a max of $50 at a time. As far as I know the\
  \ jackpot was never hit on it so however it works there was probably about $700\
  \ in the jackpot reserve that had built up over the years. I\u2019d never bothered\
  \ to have it cleaned out since it just seemed like a fun novelty. \n\nWell a friend\u2019\
  s friend hit the jackpot last night. I was fucking floored when he legit thought\
  \ he could keep my ~$700. His case was hed been playing with his own money and I\
  \ would have kept his quarters. My argument  was I\u2019d be happy to give him his\
  \ quarters back if he\u2019d asked but I\u2019m not a casino and while I\u2019m\
  \ not destitute, I can\u2019t afford to give someone $700. Argument caused the party\
  \ to wind down and one of my best guy friends basically told the guy he\u2019d be\
  \ in real shit if he tried to leave with the money but the guy left threatening\
  \ to come back with the cops and sue me in small claims court. I have no idea if\
  \ that was realistic but no cops came back. \n\nSo was I the asshole for nor letting\
  \ him keep the money?\n\nEdit: sorry guys I can't answer such witticisms as \"why\
  \ are you so shity?\" because I've been banned.\n\nEdit2: wow since I\u2019m a \u201C\
  baby gangster\u201D who has been running an \u201Cillegal gaming operation\u201D\
  \ (both things that have been said) I might as well just go whole hog and start\
  \ running guns and pimping underage Andean alpacas to people who would pay for the\
  \ privilege. I\u2019m really that bad? I just thought I had a cool thing my step\
  \ grandma got by banging a dude from the count room.\n\nEdit3: gotta address this\
  \ one directly:\n\n>If this was really last night, give it a week or a month and\
  \ see how many friends, especially mutual friends, are no longer talking to you.\
  \ Forget our votes, listen to those. Also forget small claims, you need to worry\
  \ more about hearing from your state's gambling commission.\n\nIf the moderators\
  \ allow me to update, I will ABSOLUTELY update and tell you how many friends I\u2019\
  ve lost. Almost everyone  (including the friend that brought the \u201Cwinner\u201D\
  \ thought he was being a total asshole for the way he was down on his hands and\
  \ knees scooping up quarters off the floor to put in his pockets. And he was lying\
  \ about much he put into the machine too (he said $75\u2013who the fuck walks around,\
  \ nuch less even get $75 in quarters\u2014when going to a party at a strangers house).\
  \ In addition, I will gladly, gladly call our state gaming commission (AZ) and ask\
  \ what trouble I might be in. I will also update on that when I can. People CAN\u2019\
  T be this dramatic in real life...I\u2019m a ducking instagram influencer for my\
  \ job, the phoniest, most vapid, saddest job a person can have right now and I\u2019\
  m still blown away by some of these comments. Call me YTA all you like, but don\u2019\
  t be stupid and claim to have knowledge you don\u2019t  in the process.\n\nEdit4:\
  \ well I was banned for joking around, other people have bad posts calling me a\
  \ cunt up for over an hour.  Makes INFO hard but I\u2019ll try to explain my thinking\
  \ on the money in the machine and why I can\u2019t \u201Cafford\u201D to give it\
  \ to him. \n\nSay you have a change jar, has $100 in it. Your good friend asks to\
  \ borrow $25, for parking, you'd say yes right? Another friend says wow, that\u2019\
  s cool I have $1.25 in my pocket, can I donate to your change jar? You\u2019d say\
  \ yes. Now let\u2019s say a guy you\u2019ve never met says \u201Chey I just put\
  \ .80 into your change jar, now I\u2019m taking the whole thing.\u201D You would\
  \ say no. It\u2019s how I\u2019ve always seen the slot machine as huge change jar\
  \ for all my close friends to use. I\u2019ve given people quarters to play, I\u2019\
  ve taken a quarter here and there from people who wanted to see it work. I\u2019\
  ve taken in maybe $100 over five years. Maybe. That\u2019s a nickel a day. that\u2019\
  s not a freaking illegal gambling operation.\n\n\nEdit5: a good question:\n\n>INFO\
  \ Did he explicitly ask if he was allowed to play it, and keep what he wins? If\
  \ no then he played it without permission, you aren't running a casino.\n\nNo he\
  \ did not, the first time I ever saw or spoke to him was when he was on his hands\
  \ and knees picking quarters up off the floor slamming them his pockets.  I don't\
  \ mind if people play it, I even give people quarters to play it (since no one has\
  \ change anymore) but he did not ask.\n\nEdit6: another good question\n\n>Also,\
  \ need more info. You stated that other guests have won small jackpots in the past\
  \ (max $50). Did you let them keep it? If so, why are you making a double-standard\
  \ here?\n\n\nI would have let him keep $50-100 (he certainly got away with some\
  \ in his pockets) but he was such an asshole right away that he didn't give me the\
  \ chance to come to any sort of deal. Most everyone at the party just wanted him\
  \ gone. I do feel bad and maybe my guilt over the apparent double standard is why\
  \ I'm asking here. But I do feel as though had he been even slightly cool and not\
  \ threaten cops or lawsuits I wouldn't have been backed into a corner.\n\nEdit7:\
  \ \n\n>INFO\nWe need to know where the money came from. Did the money in the machine\
  \ come from YOU putting it in or playing the machine\n\nSo this is all guess work\
  \ based on what my grandma said the jackpot could hold (there's a window that shows\
  \ the coins in rhe jackpot, the space behind is about the size of a big shoe box).\
  \ She said it gets full at $800. It was more than half when she and my grandpa gave\
  \ it to me, I always guessed $500. In five years it's now 7/8ths full. I play it\
  \ from to time to time so I'd say $100 of that is mine and $100 is friends. I think\
  \ the jackpot and normal pay outs come from different boxes so last night was the\
  \ last night I've ever seen that window empty. I know nothing of the machine or\
  \ how it works or how to change settings so I may be so wrong and a slot machine\
  \ \"nerd\" could correct me if I'm way off base.\n\nEdit8: this is the best yta\
  \ take so far and I can't let it get buried.\n\n> I really hope you get into some\
  \ serious legal trouble and then you\u2019ll wish all you lost was several hundred\
  \ and not thousands including jail time.\n\nEdit9 (at 5:45am, gotta work): you guys\
  \ are really cracking me up. I love the comments that say \"your edits make you\
  \ YTA! Alone. Where did the money come from btw?\"  I truly can accept the YTA votes\
  \ but so freaking many of them have basic facts wrong.\n\n1. I wasn't profiting\
  \ off this machine. I've literally never opened it up and taken a single coin out.\n\
  \n2. I can't afford to give a random dude $700. I don't need it now, but I have\
  \ savings account I don't need it now either but I might some day. And now I've\
  \ found out that some of the quarters that my grandma had from the 50s or 60s might\
  \ actually be silver. So good thing I hung onto them right ? (I can't wait for the\
  \ \"you're a stupid thot\" rationalizations to come from this one). \n\n3. I never\
  \ cleaned it out because honestly I like the way it looked with the coins in the\
  \ window. This thing is enourmous and built with casino security in mind so it was\
  \ in fact, a great piggy bank. \n\n4. Some nice NTAs have suggested I have a bowl\
  \ of quarters a for people to play. I actually in effect did that because 80% the\
  \ time people who wanted to play didn't have change (I got it five years ago) so\
  \ I always had quarters around, maybe just not right by the machine. \n\n5. As an\
  \ example, Over the years it's mostly friends kids who want to play. I had a very\
  \ precocious 9 year old once come over with his $20 of money truly expecting to\
  \ get the jackpot. He was heartbroken when he didn't win (I might have given it\
  \ to him since he was so cute) but I gave him a $20 silver certificate my step grandma\
  \ had given me (acquired ny dubious means no doubt) and that kid was thrilled. so\
  \ I always, always give people money back if they ask. I never intended to profit\
  \ off the machine. No one has ever made a big deal of it before (save the 9 year\
  \ old).\n\nEdit10: this dude wins the comments, for all time:\n\n>I bet u look like\
  \ jared fogle or some shit\n\n\U0001F602\U0001F602\U0001F602\U0001F602\U0001F602\
  \U0001F602\U0001F602\U0001F602\U0001F602\U0001F602\U0001F602\n\n\nEdit 11: sooooo\
  \ the plot thickens, thank you to some very helpful people who own slot machines\
  \ who DM'ed who were also able to suggest experts in my area, I was able to call\
  \ a local person who works on antique slot machines. My slot machine is highly customized\
  \ but it's based around a pretty well known model from that era (don't want to say\
  \ exactly because only a few of them exist anymore) and he said I could tell right\
  \ away if the machine was broken or had been tampered with. In my very, very, very\
  \ amateur job of checking it over it does appear that this little piece is either\
  \ broken or misplaced. So it looks like this piece of shit \"guest\" actually broke\
  \ my machine to steal my money. There wasn't a jackpot at all. I don't have confirmation\
  \ of this until the repair guy is able to come later this week but it looks like\
  \ that's what happened. The guy said there's an outside chance that if that piece\
  \ was broken or tampered with that it was an accident but he wouldn't bet on it.\
  \  I still don't care if I'm YTA till the cows come home, posting here has probably\
  \ allowed me to get to the bottom of this. And fuck that guy.\n\n\nEdit 12: well\
  \ the amazing and level headed moderators of this sub just ever so politely informed\
  \ me that I will not be allowed to update this post. So the short story is the \"\
  winner\" almost certainly was hitting the machine and caused the jackpot to spill\
  \ out. So had I been a real casino I would have enacted the \"malfunction voids\
  \ all pays and plays\" clause. So yeah, I was totally in the right. Fuck this sub.\
  \ Fuck the moderators. And fuck those of you on your stupid high horse. Most of\
  \ you however were cool."
