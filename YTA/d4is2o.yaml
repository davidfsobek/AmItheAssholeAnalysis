selftext: 'I live in a pretty small town, so if you don''t know somebody directly,
  you''re likely to know a person who knows them, and this is pretty much biting me
  in the ass right now.


  My husband and I are looking to upgrade homes given we''re planning on expanding
  our family, so we''ve been looking at a few open houses recently. About a week ago
  we were at an open house when our daughter (4) wandered off and picked up this mask
  type thing laying out on a table. Super bright, very loud, apparently VERY fragile
  and pretty much right out in the open. When I saw her touching it I told her to
  put it down but it was too late and somehow it had gotten cracked down the middle.
  Now, I''m not sure if it was already broken and they had left it out as some sort
  of trap (because who leaves something bright like that lying around during an open
  house, with children walking around?), or if she did anything, but I felt extremely
  embarrassed and grabbed my daughter and told my husband it was time to leave.


  A so called friend of mine who knows the house owner saw me there and apparently
  told her she saw me rushing out of her house on the same day she returned to find
  the mask broken. Now she''s hitting me up on the phone demanding I pay her back
  for breaking "art" and naming an absolutely ludicrous price (think four figures).
  I''m absolutely not going to pay her that, but a few people I know think I''m in
  the wrong here. I personally think if you''re having an open house that children
  will be visiting you don''t leave expensive breakables out in the open. I also do
  not believe for a second that thing was worth thousands of dollars, and if it was,
  I think there''s a very good chance she broke it herself then left it lying around
  to pin it on someone else and guilt some money out of them. Whose the asshole here?'
