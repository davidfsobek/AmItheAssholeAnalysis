selftext: "My wife and I divorced when my daughter was 6 years old, and my wife had\
  \ custody of my daughter for the most part since I was too busy working 50 hours\
  \ a week, she quickly moved on to be with another man 7 years younger than her.\
  \ I knew from many stories I've heard that my daughter would probably end up being\
  \ closer to him than me, since not only was our time together very limited but he\
  \ was a stay at home dad, which means they had plenty of time to bond together which\
  \ makes me feel sick to this day. This may sound immature but I made her promise\
  \ to never ever call her stepdad(dad), that I was her only father and to not betray\
  \ me. But I have no control over what she or they do in their home. Fast forward\
  \ to now my prediction came through and she's obviously closer to her step dad than\
  \ me. She has gotten engaged about a year ago and now that the wedding is approaching\
  \ near(1 month or so)  she's now out of the blue told me that she wants both me\
  \ and her stepdad to walk her down the aisle after promising me I would be the one\
  \ to do it. Even though I know they're very close, I don't believe he has any right\
  \ to walk my blood daugther down the aisle. I am her only father, it isn't fair\
  \ that he got to be with my daugther more than me, her bio dad, and now he wants\
  \ to take this moment from me too. I got a bit angry and told her I absolutely will\
  \ not share an honor that is meant for me the actual father of the bride with some\
  \ guy I barely know. She told me he's done a lot for her growing up and that I'm\
  \ being petty over something that happened years ago. I told her I wasn't going\
  \ to argue about it and if she wants her stepdad to walk her she can, but I won't\
  \ be there to see it. \n\nI was told by a friend of mine who uses this site quite\
  \ often that many people have gone through something similar to this with their\
  \ kids or parents, so I wanted to see other people's perspective, on if it's wrong\
  \ for me to want to be the only one to walk my only daughter down the aisle."
title: AITA for telling my daughter [26F] that I [55M] will not walk down the aisle
  with her stepdad [50M].
