selftext: 'When my girlfriend and I put out advertisements for a roommate we specified
  that we keep a strict vegan house - no exceptions. This meant no meat in the house,
  no dairy, no eggs, not even honey. We were very clear on this and outright said
  another vegan would be ideal. And that actually worked out pretty smoothly! A girl
  we''ll call Jessica moved in and things went along swimmingly for the past three
  years. Jessica was also an ethical vegan and there was no fuss over food, no drama,
  everything was peaceful and we all were pleased with the arrangement.


  Enter Jessica''s new boyfriend, Charlie. Charlie absolutely does NOT agree with
  veganism. Ever since an incident where he drunkenly tried to store a bunch of half
  eaten sausages in our fridge and I told him he wasn''t keeping that shit in our
  house, he''s had a big problem with me. Whenever he comes over he''ll make snide
  little comments about our little vegan decontamination zone, and loudly talk about
  how much he loves meat and all the the meat he recently ate. To sum up how childish
  he is, he went as far as to ask if he was allowed to take a non-vegan shit in our
  toilet in front of a bunch my guests my girlfriend and I were hosting which was
  completely embarrassing for everyone. He''s a complete dickhead, but that isn''t
  what the main issue is.


  I figured Jessica wouldn''t put up with Charlie for long given how he behaves, but
  not only has that not happened, he''s talked her out of veganism entirely. When
  Jessica let me know that she was no longer vegan, I told her as long as she didn''t
  store it in the house, it was fine. Seeing her bring meat takeout into our house
  to eat was upsetting, I won''t lie, especially given Charlie would often be grinning
  like a rat during the entire ordeal. Not to mention the smell.


  Emboldened by Charlie, she''s started to store non-vegan food in our fridge. First
  it was butter and some liquid egg whites, which my girlfriend begged me not to start
  something over given how tense things had gotten, but earlier today I came home
  and found multiple packets of bacon taking up nearly an entire shelf of the fridge.
  I gathered them up in a trash bag alongside the butter and other stuff that had
  built up and just tossed it all in the bin outside. When Jessica returned and saw
  it was all gone a shouting match broke out and now she''s claiming I can''t force
  her to keep a vegan fridge, and our agreement meant nothing at all. I told her perhaps
  it was better she find another house to rent at, and she called me a controlling
  dick.


  I don''t think I''m being controlling **GIVEN THIS AGREEMENT WAS CLEARLY SPECIFIED**.
  It wasn''t a hidden clause, it wasn''t something I sprung on her. In my opinion
  Jessica and Charlie are both behaving like absolute fucknuggets, but when I vented
  to my brother he said that I was actually being a dick in this situation.


  So I come to you, reddit. Whose the actual asshole in this situation?'
