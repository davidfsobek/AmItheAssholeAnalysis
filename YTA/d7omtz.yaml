selftext: "Edit: I meant \u201Cunlocked\u201D in title. Not open. \n\nMe, my wife\
  \ and my (16 year old)son live in an apartment, so we share the bathroom. He always\
  \ took long showers(30 minutes or so), but lately he\u2019s been taking it too far.\
  \ He gets in bathroom for an hour, two hours. \n\nLast straw was few days ago when\
  \ stayed there for 3.5 HOURS. That\u2019s just not reasonable in my opinion. I told\
  \ him that he wouldn\u2019t lock the door from now on and if he took longer than\
  \ 40 minutes I\u2019d walk in. He\u2019s not happy about it.\n\nMy wife thinks I\u2019\
  m being too strict and not respecting his privacy.\n\n\nMore info: he has his own\
  \ room and he can lock door any time he wants, so he has privacy. I\u2019ve talked\
  \ to him multiple times and he just ignores me. He also doesn\u2019t take his phone\
  \ in there(some of you suggested that I turn off wifi while he\u2019s in there).\n\
  \nI wouldn\u2019t just barge in btw, I\u2019d knock first and warn him."
