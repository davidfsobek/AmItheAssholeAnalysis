selftext: "Throwaway because some of my church friends know my main account. \n\n\
  Backstory: My husband and I have two kids (both teenagers). We raised our children\
  \ to be Christian (as is our faith), but also didn\u2019t want to force them into\
  \ our religion so as soon as they turned 13 they were allowed to no longer come\
  \ to church, participate in saying grace before meals, etc.. One of our kids has\
  \ continued with church and their faith very adamantly. Our other kid has come to\
  \ church more sporadically and over the past half year or so has began to explore\
  \ Buddhism. More recently they have been telling us that they are no longer Christian,\
  \ but they are Buddhists. While we are disappointed that they are no longer Christian,\
  \ I  believe everyone is entitled to their own religion and I am proud that my daughter\
  \ is exploring her faith. \n\nCurrent Issue: At dinner recently we were talking\
  \ about travel plans for Christmas (we usually will rent a cabin somewhere for family\
  \ time) and I mentioned that I wasn\u2019t planning to get our non-Christian daughter\
  \ any big gifts since her religion doesn\u2019t celebrate Christmas. She was immediately\
  \ upset. I told her that I would get her some little goodies so she didn\u2019t\
  \ feel too left out, but that she shouldn\u2019t expect to partake in a religious\
  \ holiday for a religion she doesn\u2019t believe in. She said (I\u2019m so many\
  \ words) it\u2019s not fair for us to spend money on our other child\u2019s gifts,\
  \ but not her and that we were punishing her for not being Christian. It doesn\u2019\
  t make sense to me to give her gifts to celebrate the birth of Jesus when she doesn\u2019\
  t believe he is our savior. I told her if she really felt it were unfair, I would\
  \ donate the amount of money I spent on our other kid to a charity of her choice\
  \ in her name. She didn\u2019t like this either. My husband and I have since talked\
  \ and he has very mixed feelings on the whole situation. \n\nAITA?\n\nEdited to\
  \ add: not sure if this matters, but I have made it clear to her that if she ever\
  \ wanted to celebrate any holidays pertaining to her religion I would do my best\
  \ and get her what she needs to celebrate. My goal is not to hinder her exploration\
  \ of Buddhism.\n\nEdited to add: I see a lot of comments about how Christmas isn\u2019\
  t a Christian holiday and I agree that many families celebrate a very commercialized\
  \ Christmas. We (for example) do not involve Santa in our celebration, but we do\
  \ (for example) read from the Bible and sing Hymns. Regardless of what others do,\
  \ our family takes the holiday as an opportunity to celebrate and thank God for\
  \ all that he has done and provided for us.\n\nFinal Edit (Hopefully): I hear you\
  \ all and I know I have a lot of reflection ahead of me. Even though some of this\
  \ is hard to read, I really do appreciate you all taking the time to respond. I\
  \ think my family has a lot of discussion ahead of us and I specifically have some\
  \ growth to do as a mother and Christian. I also want to let those of you who have\
  \ voiced concerns know that both of my children are loved by my husband and myself\
  \ and that I plan on talking with my daughter (maybe even showing her this thread)\
  \ about how I can do better by her."
