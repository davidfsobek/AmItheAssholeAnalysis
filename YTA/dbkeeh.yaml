selftext: "So there\u2019s this girl in my friend group. She has a tendency to be\
  \ kind of over the top and stretches the truth a lot. We all were hanging out over\
  \ the weekend to celebrate another friend\u2019s birthday. Apparently a few people\
  \ had the idea to give her \u201Cpot brownies\u201D and see how she\u2019d react.\
  \ The catch is that they had nothing in them at all. But they were banking on her\
  \ acting high anyway to fit in with everyone else. \n\nI didn\u2019t find out about\
  \ this whole plan until I got there. Everyone else pretended to be high and so did\
  \ the girl, predictably. I didn\u2019t participate in that part but I also didn\u2019\
  t tell her it was all a huge joke at her expense. \n\nAt the end of the night someone\
  \ told her and called her out on always being fake. She got really upset and ended\
  \ up leaving the party early by herself. I do feel bad for her but I also feel like\
  \ she kind of brings this on herself sometimes because she\u2019s always trying\
  \ too hard. \n\nAgain though, this wasn\u2019t my prank and I probably wouldn\u2019\
  t have planned something like this myself. But it is what it is now. \n\nAITA?\n\
  \n**EDIT: Okay not sure why this post blew up like this. Wow. Anyway I get that\
  \ people feel like we were all wrong in the situation. I said from the start I didn\u2019\
  t like how it went. But despite what people think, we are actually all still friends\
  \ (including the girl who got pranked). I would bring the situation up but it\u2019\
  s now been like 3 days and I feel like it\u2019ll just cause drama. If it does ever\
  \ come up I will say I think it was wrong, apologize etc. Gotta say though, I find\
  \ it a little ironic that people are literally telling me to KILL myself in PM while\
  \ also lecturing me about being a bully.**"
