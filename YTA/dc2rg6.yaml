selftext: "Got married last weekend and had a lovely day, but had some commotion early\
  \ on the wedding day. \n\nFor flower girl, we had a choice between my two nieces,\
  \ Amber and Katie. They're both eight and it was a tough decision. Unfortunately\
  \ for my perfect day I felt shallow and since Amber has more of a typical angelic\
  \ ''cute'' appearance (very long hair, glasses, big smile) I picked her. Her parents\
  \ also convinced me she deserved it because she got top marks in some assessment\
  \ her school did. \n\nDuring the wedding prep Katie and her dad (my brother) kept\
  \ telling me that Amber had been bullying her about the fact she didn't get the\
  \ job. The girls have never liked each other for reasons I don't know. I didn't\
  \ pay too much mind to it since I was too caught up in myself.\n\nOn the wedding\
  \ morning I got to witness the bullying myself and it was pretty cruel. Amber (and\
  \ keep in mind this is an eight year old child) told Katie that she'd never get\
  \ married because she's too ugly. I could imagine how upsetting this would be for\
  \ a child and I made Amber apologise and also took away the flower girl job and\
  \ gave it to Katie. Amber was crying throughout the wedding day, and for the past\
  \ days I haven't heard anything from her dad my other brother. \n\nMy husband and\
  \ I are going away on our honeymoon on thursday, and i was anxious to get in touch\
  \ with my brother before we leave. He finally called me and was extremely angry\
  \ at me for taking the job away from his daughter. He said Amber has been crying\
  \ the past two days and felt really humiliated, and was really looking forward to\
  \ the job. \n\nAs someone who was bullied myself growing up, it felt like the right\
  \ thing to do after Amber's behaviour towards Katie. I can't imagine how upsetting\
  \ those comments would be, and at that point Katie, who had never been anything\
  \ other than well behaved deserved it more than Amber."
