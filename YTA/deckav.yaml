selftext: "So my 6 year old daughter gave my 8 year old son a piece of paper with\
  \ a picture on it and he ripped it up and said \u201CThis means nothing to me.\u201D\
  \ Right in her face and made her cry. So I grabbed a craft he made me yesterday\
  \ (nothing sentimental and he didn\u2019t work hard on it) and ripped it up and\
  \ told him it meant nothing to me. He cried and ran to my wife and she told me I\
  \ shouldn\u2019t have done that and it\u2019s different for a brother to be a jerk\
  \ to their sister but I shouldn\u2019t have stooped to his level but I feel like\
  \ it was a needed lesson and he wouldn\u2019t do it again because now he knows how\
  \ it feels.\n\nAITA?\n\n\nEdit: I have 5 children. Two adult children, a 10 year\
  \ old and the 8/6 year olds mentioned in this post. \n\nMy 8 year old is the only\
  \ boy and he has always been a dick to his sister. Ever since he was two years old\
  \ and she was a newborn. The kid is just mean to her. But he\u2019s not mirroring\
  \ behavior taught. I have never done anything like this, but he does all the time.\
  \ I thought perhaps having a \u201Ctaste of his own medicine\u201D would get the\
  \ point across. \n\nI was wrong.\n\nThank you for the judgement. \n\nI will think\
  \ long and hard about where to go from here.\n\nEdit 2: I took my son out to breakfast\
  \ just him and I, and we talked about my actions and why I did it, and i apologized.\
  \ There\u2019s no guidebook to parenting. And we all make mistakes. \n\nI will say\
  \ he had absolutely forgotten about it, ignored my apology (not in a spiteful way)\
  \ and tried to con me into letting him have chocolate chip pancakes so I think we\u2019\
  re good."
