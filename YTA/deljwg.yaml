selftext: "We have two daughters, Jody who is 26 and Hanna who is 28.\n\nBoth of them\
  \ are engaged to two wonderful men who we adore.\n\nMy wife and I have saved roughly\
  \ $50k for each daughter as a wedding fund. We aren't rich people so it took us\
  \ years of being careful with our finances to help pay for half their college and\
  \ this wedding fund.\n\nWe sat down with both my daughters separately to talk about\
  \ their wedding plans. They did not know we had a fund for them. This was probably\
  \ our first mistake.\n\nHanna immediately said she did not want a large wedding\
  \ and would rather save money for a house deposit. She was going to do a courthouse\
  \ wedding followed by a reception next year. So my wife and I agreed we would give\
  \ her the wedding fund for that purpose. Again, we didn't communicate any of this\
  \ with her. A huge mistake in hindsight.\n\nJody wanted a decent sized wedding.\
  \ Something the fund would've covered.\n\nMy wife and I decided to pay for several\
  \ of our family members from out of the country to attend. We knew it would be expensive\
  \ but we knew we were only having one traditional wedding and we hadn't seen some\
  \ close family close to 20 years.\n\nUnfortunately, the costs started going out\
  \ of control and we ended up taking $15K out of Hanna's wedding fund to cover the\
  \ difference. At the time, we felt ok doing this because the extra costs of the\
  \ wedding were due to our decisions, not Jody's.\n\nThe wedding happened a few weeks\
  \ ago and it was perfect.\n\nThe problem now is that Hanna is aware we paid for\
  \ most of her sister's wedding. She isn't aware about the costs and that we had\
  \ to use some of her wedding fund.\n\nA week after her sister's wedding, she came\
  \ to us and said she changed her mind after seeing how beautiful it was. That she\
  \ too wants a wedding like that with all of our extended family.\n\nMy wife and\
  \ I had to tell her there was no way we could pay for all the extras again because\
  \ we thought it'd be a once in a lifetime situation. We told her we'd be giving\
  \ her around $35k for a house deposit and hosting her reception at our home.\n\n\
  Hanna had a complete meltdown and accused us of playing favorites. She left in tears.\n\
  \nShe is now telling us she's too busy to meet for dinner or lunch when she used\
  \ to drop by a few times a week.\n\nThis situation has now reached other members\
  \ of our family who are chiming in.\n\nThis has been killing us. My wife told me\
  \ we should just take the other $25k-30k from our savings to make this smooth over.\n\
  \nA part of me agrees but a larger part of me is angry that we have to mess with\
  \ our retirement just because Hanna changed her mind. And I know part of her decision\
  \ change is because of the constant competition our daughters have had growing up.\
  \ \n\nAITA for thinking everything should stick to the original plan? My wife disagrees\
  \ with me."
