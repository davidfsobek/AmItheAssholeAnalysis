selftext: "My brother died. He was an incredible, funny guy, I miss him like I lost\
  \ one of my limbs. Maybe it\u2019s stupid, but I want people to remember the person\
  \ he was. My dad and aunts have been involved in planning his funeral and they have\
  \ been planning a very Catholic funeral service. He wasn\u2019t Catholic and wouldn\u2019\
  t like the very expensive casket, the flowers, the church with a lot of people he\
  \ didn\u2019t know there. He\u2019d think it\u2019s way too fancy, way too much.\
  \ \n\nHe and I had morbid discussions a lot (side effect of me being a goth teenager,\
  \ I guess). He told me he wanted to be cremated and his ashes thrown into a ceiling\
  \ fan while \u201CIt\u2019s Raining Men\u201D played in the background...obviously\
  \ not an option....Also, together we made up a funny funeral playlist, including\
  \ songs like \u201CHighway to Hell\u201D and \u201CAnother One Bites the Dust.\u201D\
  \ \n\nTo remember him, I want to bring a speaker and play \u201CAnother One Bites\
  \ the Dust\u201D at his wake. I would explain it to the people at the wake and say\
  \ that I wanted to preserve the person he was. Maybe I could give a speech, or tell\
  \ the story and explain how he saw death with humor, not sadness. There will be\
  \ a lot of extended, older family members there who weren\u2019t very familiar with\
  \ him and are Catholic, so I\u2019ve been thinking maybe not. But I really want\
  \ to preserve his memory as he was, not what people think he should have been. I\
  \ think my cousins and sister would get a kick out of it. \n\nWIBTA?\n\nEdit: I\
  \ didn\u2019t really expect this response, but thank you. My brother would have\
  \ been absolutely thrilled by all of your comments. I swear, I almost sense his\
  \ hand in it. I don\u2019t know if anyone will see this update, but here goes, \n\
  \nThis morning, I talked to my dad about the wake. I suggested, as some of you did,\
  \ that maybe I could give a eulogy and talk about my brother, and then play a instrumental\
  \ cover of the song. I found a violin one that I really liked. My dad listened to\
  \ the cover and looked at the list that my brother and I made. He actually smiled\
  \ and laughed, and said that it seemed like a great idea. I hadn\u2019t really been\
  \ thinking about my Dad as much as I should have, I thought of him as opposition,\
  \ I guess he cared way less about the Catholic stuff than I thought. \n\nI also\
  \ reached out to some of my brother\u2019 s friends. Some of them had already been\
  \ planning a party in his honor and they were happy to listen to some of my ideas.\
  \ We are going to play all the songs on the list, plus a few others that apparently\
  \ he told his friends about and not me, and we\u2019re going to start working on\
  \ logistics for scattering (not human!) ashes from a ceiling fan.\n\nThanks again."
