selftext: "Yesterday a mutual friend came over and gave her a gift of a Toblerone\
  \ from his holiday in Switzerland. She agreed I could have some so I did. She's\
  \ out for a for days and my temptation got the best of me, so I ate the rest of\
  \ an almost full packet.\n\nShe has a habit of leaving food out to spoil, so I assumed\
  \ it was all good to eat, but she sent me a message to make sure that there's some\
  \ of the chocolate left for her. Fuck, it was already gone, so I've just rushed\
  \ to the shop to get a new one in expectance that I'm a dead man when she gets back.\
  \ \n\nShe once flipped out at me for eating her year old decorative pasta, so I'm\
  \ not taking chances.\n\nToblerone is replaced - with even more than there was previously.\
  \ Not sure if I should put it in the Swiss packaging or apologize and just tell\
  \ her that I bought I new one. For now I'm keeping quiet, like a parent discovering\
  \ the dead goldfish and doing the ol' switcheroo. I'm in the UK btw, so the recipe\
  \ is exactly the same as the one's in Switzerland.\n\nAITA?\n\nAlso, she religiously\
  \ reads this sub, so if she comes across this - G, I love you and I hope you forgive\
  \ me like you did with the pasta.\n\n\n\nEdit: she fuuucking saw the post and replied!\
  \ but seriously, never again. \u2764\uFE0F\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/df8i1a/aita_for_eating_my_all_of_wifes_toblerone_then/f32i9g7?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share"
