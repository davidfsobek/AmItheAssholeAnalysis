selftext: "Please bear with me while I try to gather my thoughts and explain just\
  \ what\u2019s going on. I (M40)was married to my wife (F38) for 18 years. We had\
  \ what I thought was a perfect relationship, we barely fought, got along great,\
  \ and she was my best friend. We had two sons together, J who is 14 and M who is\
  \ 16. \n\nMy wife passed extremely unexpectedly a month ago and it absolutely shattered\
  \ our world. I feel so alone and have even started going to counseling to help with\
  \ getting over her. \n\nHere is the hard part. Two nights ago I decided to go through\
  \ my wife\u2019s cell phone to read our text messages and look at some photos she\
  \ had taken I never got sent. That\u2019s when I found the messages after I decided\
  \ to look through her browser history. \n\nMessages to men in their 60\u2019s sending\
  \ dirty photos she had sent me. Nights she told me she was visiting her sister,\
  \ she was actually out with these men doing god knows what for money. I don\u2019\
  t want to get into to much detail with how filthy some of they were, but I cannot\
  \ believe she could have done this to me. I suspected nothing. Ever. \n\nMy sons\
  \ are obviously still crushed and always talking up their mother and how sweet,\
  \ amazing she is. How much they miss her love and honesty. I cannot see her as the\
  \ woman I thought I knew and I am torn on what to do. On one hand, I don\u2019t\
  \ want to make this passing harder for them and hinder their thoughts about their\
  \ mother but on another hand I feel they are old enough to know the truth. \n\n\
  WIBTA if I exposed my late wife to my sons and told them what she was really doing\
  \ to our family? Please help me.\n\n\nEDIT: Wow. Thanks for all the feedback. I\
  \ never knew that me losing a best friend, wife and mother of my children would\
  \ end with me being berated. This post didn\u2019t come from malicious intent to\
  \ hurt my children, and I apologize if it came out that way. I asked because I truly\
  \ don\u2019t know. I feel that I would have wanted to know who my mother was fully\
  \ but I can see why so many disagree. \nThis is something that I will keep to myself\
  \ for now- and if my children ever inquire further that\u2019s something I will\
  \ deal with along the way. \n\nTo all the ones who were kind, thank you. And to\
  \ those calling me a selfish piece of shit I hope you are never put in my position.\
  \ Thank you.\n\nLAST EDIT: It\u2019s now been about 24 hours since my post- which\
  \ I never thought would get front page- and I want to thank everyone who has reached\
  \ out to me. I understand that \u2018exposing\u2019 was a very poor word choice\
  \ and came across the wrong way. I\u2019m still trying to message everyone back\
  \ who has privately reached out. \nAs I said earlier, this will be something I keep\
  \ to myself and have a talk about truth with my sons down the road. I\u2019m meeting\
  \ with her family today to figure out what to do about her things and what else.\
  \ I\u2019m also looking into therapists for my sons today like many of you have\
  \ mentioned."
