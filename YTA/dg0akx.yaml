selftext: "My wife sucks at giving gifts, so in recent years she's defaulted to just\
  \ asking me what I like and I don't mind. After doing a bunch of particularly stupid\
  \ things, she was feeling particularly in a giving mood to thank me for my patience\
  \ and even though I insisted I didn't want any gifts, she told me I can get anything\
  \ I want. I asked her whether she meant anything really? And she said yes. \n\n\
  So I ended up suggesting some sexual acts that we had discussed before but tabled\
  \ because she had told me specifically that she wasn't too comfortable with them\
  \ but she might save them for a special day. I distinctly remember that conversation\
  \ because .. well .. you're not going to forget something like that. (And it's nothing\
  \ very kinky I'm afraid, for those of you who might be excited for we have quite\
  \ vanilla lives.)\n\nShe's mad that I took this opportunity to make it into something\
  \ sexual, something she agreed upon when she asked me specifically for ANYTHING\
  \ I wanted.\n\nAITA here?"
