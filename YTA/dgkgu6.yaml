selftext: "I\u2019ve been with my boyfriend for a couple years and normally we get\
  \ on wonderfully and there\u2019s 0 clash of personality. \n\nOne of the things\
  \ that we don\u2019t always see eye to eye on is food- I love to cook and experiment\
  \ with food, and he is very much a meat and potatoes kinda guy. \n\nI recently ate\
  \ a steak that was well done that tasted REALLY good. I know there\u2019s going\
  \ to be a lot of people turning their noses up and saying \u2018impossible\u2019\
  \ but honestly, it was delicious and I wanted to try and recreate it at home. \n\
  \nI asked my boyfriend if he would be interested if I purchased some steaks and\
  \ I specified it was an experiment to give the well done steak a try at home. He\
  \ said he was on board. \n\nOn the day of I prepped and was ready to go. At the\
  \ last minute he decided he wanted it rare. I was super disappointed and irritated\
  \ because I wouldn\u2019t have ordinarily bought the steaks midweek, it was specially\
  \ to give this a try- and I was excited because I thought he could try it and I\
  \ had a feeling he\u2019d enjoy it.\n\nI said I was NOT preparing him a rare steak.\
  \ I said if he wanted to cook his own steak rare that was fine but I had been excited\
  \ to prepare this for him. I ended up cooking my own steak and he ended up making\
  \ his own. He\u2019s been telling everyone and anyone that I\u2019m petty and should\
  \ have just accepted that he changed his mind."
