selftext: "My sister (36)  has been single for quite some time and actively looking\
  \ to get in a marriage-track relationship. She recently finished her training as\
  \ a surgical subspecialist and has extremely high standards of what she expects\
  \ in her partner. Just because she has recently been grossing over half a million\
  \ and has Ivy league credentials she expects her partner have the same. She also\
  \ has strict physical requirements (at least 6 foot tall even though she is 5'2\"\
  \ , under 40, full head of hair, athletic but \"not too athletic\" etc). \n\nshe\
  \ basically eliminates like 99% of the male dating pool with these silly requirements.\
  \ \n\nIts hard to judge as  a brother but I'd say she's average to above average\
  \ in the looks department. She could definitely try harder with makeup and hair\
  \ and whatnot. But she acts extremely masculine - aggressive, confrontational, and\
  \ dismissive to those she feels are beneath her (my words not hers). Its been like\
  \ this her entire life. If another woman had that personality I wouldnt want to\
  \ date them.\n\nlast night she told me about her   \"bad luck\" and i basically\
  \ told her to widen her pool by lowering her expectations and to work harder on\
  \ her appearance and act more cordial and feminine. She lost it and hung up on me\
  \ and is not returning my texts and calls.\n\nAITA here?"
title: AITA for telling my sister she either needs to raise her own standards or lower
  her expectations for dating/getting married?
