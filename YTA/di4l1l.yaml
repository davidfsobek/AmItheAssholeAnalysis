selftext: 'My gf wants to host a game night, but one of her friends has a newborn(4weeks
  old). The parents want everyone to have their flu shots before they bring the kid
  over. Maybe it''s because I(30yr M) grew up before flu shots were a thing, but I
  don''t feel that I should be required to have a shot to hang out with them. If they
  are worried about their kid they should get a sitter and leave him at home.


  My gf got pissed and said I was being unreasonable because the flu shot was inexpensive
  and you can easily get them at a CVS. I am all about vaccinations, but I am not
  a fan of being told I need to do something for someone else''s peace of mind.


  Edit:


  Quick edit, that I thought was obvious. I am not going to go if the baby will be
  there, and I don''t have my shot. I don''t want to get a baby sick/possibly die.
  I may still be the A\*\*hole, but I am not heartless.

  UPDATE:


  I wanted to let everyone know that I got the flu shot, went to game night, and it
  was a lot of fun. Thanks everyone for weighing in; even though I ended up being
  the A-hole, good to know a few people agreed with me.'
