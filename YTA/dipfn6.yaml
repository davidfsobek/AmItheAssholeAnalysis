selftext: "In high school I was bullied a lot for being gay. It\u2019s been eight\
  \ years. In the five years since, three people (the people who hurt me the most,\
  \ actually) have reached out to me to \u201Csincerely apologies\u201D for the way\
  \ they treated me in high school. They *claim* that they didn\u2019t understand\
  \ what I was going through at the time, and they feel horrible about how they treated\
  \ me, and they said being gay is perfectly fine and no one should be bullied for\
  \ that.\n\nI told them each to fuck off.\n\nI don\u2019t believe in forgiving people\
  \ who claim to no longer be bigoted, period. What do I get out of it? Nothing. forgiving\
  \ them doesn\u2019t change the hurt they caused. Forgiving them doesn\u2019t change\
  \ that they thought I was a lesser human solely because I was gay. They can \u201C\
  claim\u201D they\u2019ve changed until they\u2019re blue in the face, but I will\
  \ **never** forgive them or any homophobic person for being bigoted in the past.\n\
  \nMy friends say that I\u2019m being too extreme and I should be more forgiving.\
  \ But why? I owe them nothing. They\u2019re assholes. They treated me terribly.\
  \ They can take their apology and shove it up their ass.\n\nBigotry doesn\u2019\
  t deserve to be forgiven. Ever.\n\nAITA for that?"
