selftext: "My daughter just turned 6. We had a birthday party for her on Saturday.\
  \ That morning was pretty hectic. I was outside setting up and suddenly my wife\
  \ comes outside yelling about how the grocery store screwed up the birthday cake\
  \ and I didn't notice.\n\nAll that happened was that they spelled our daughter's\
  \ name as \"Sarah\" and it's \"Sara\" and I said, \"who cares, just scrape off the\
  \ H\" but she insisted on returning it. So I said \"fine whatever.\" And then as\
  \ she's leaving she says since I screwed up already I should make upfor it by finishing\
  \ the decorations. \n\nAnd I go into the kitchen and I ask my daughter, \"what's\
  \ the most important thing?\" She says \"the gift bags.\" I found all the candy\
  \ and toys and what I thought were the bags they were supposed to go into. So I\
  \ make up the bags, my daughter helps, and she thinks they look great and she's\
  \ happy with them.\n\nMy wife comes home and takes over, satisfied by the new cake\
  \ and the attempt I made at helping. So a little while after that, the guests arrive.\
  \ The day went pretty well until the end. My daughter reminds us that they need\
  \ to hand out gift bags. My wife panics thinking she forgot about them, but she\
  \ says \"dont worry, dad made them\" and she looked so relieved until I got the\
  \ box. She looked inside an was horrified\n\n\"What the fuck is this?\" she whispers.\
  \ And she thrusts the box back at me and rushes to the bedroom. I follow her and\
  \ find her sitting on the bed crying. She's SO embarrassed. Why? She wont say. I'm\
  \ not sure what to do because people are trying to leave and they're confused as\
  \ to whats going on. I then I just take over \"goodbye\" duty and hand out the bags\
  \ to kids at the door and say bye with my daughter.\n\nWell halfway through doing\
  \ that my wife came back out and took the box from me and brought it into the bedroom\
  \ and threw it on the ground. wtf? she finally tells me \"those are dog poop bags\"\
  \ and basically I'm stupid and I've ruined all the hard work she put into the party.\n\
  \nwell, reddit, they dont look like \"dog poop\" bags. they're just small pink bags\
  \ with hearts on them. who really cares? I tell her \"It's not like they're dirty.\
  \ they're small bags like any other bags\" and damn it she freaked. She says she's\
  \ so mortified she doesnt even want to show her face at the school anymore.\n\n\
  So yeah I've been bringing my daughter to school every day this week (which has\
  \ been making me late for work). my wife will barely even speak to me even though\
  \ my daughter thinks everything was fine. she laughed when i told her they were\
  \ really dog poop bags. my wife got even more mad at me for telling her. I told\
  \ my wife she needs to chill and she basically said I was a huge asshole and she's\
  \ mad that I dont think it's a big deal. and I still dont. Actually, I think I'm\
  \ the one that should be mad at HER for keeping this going for almost a week.\n\n\
  So, Reddit, AITA?\n\nTL;DR: I used dog poop bags as goody bags by accident for 6\
  \ year old daughter's bday party"
