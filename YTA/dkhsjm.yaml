selftext: "Edit: didnt expect this to be a reason to be called a \"child molestator\
  \ cultist\" but I suppose that's reddit for you?\n\nI am getting married in a few\
  \ months. We have a few atheist friends who have a general dislike for religion\
  \ so I thought it would be for the best to only invite them to the party. My future\
  \ wife and both of our families are Roman Catholic. Catholic ceremonies are *long*.\
  \ I'm talking 1 hour of pure mass and additional half an hour of the actual \"getting\
  \ married\" part. If you are not a believer, it is boring af. Hell, Im Catholic\
  \ and I know I'll be bored for 80% of it. I thought I'll spare them the trouble.\n\
  \nAnyway, one of my friends brought it up, saying I forgot to put the time and the\
  \ church where the ceremony will take place on the invitation. So I said that she\
  \ doesnt have to come to the religious part and just come for the wild party part.\
  \ She got confused, I explained and she got annoyed to say the least. Said she isnt\
  \ heartless and would sit through the 2/3 to see me get married in the 1/3. I tried\
  \ to explain again & fix things but I felt guilty the whole time. \n\nWas it an\
  \ asshole move?\n\n\nEdit: ah, I suppose I am TA. Just for clarification though:\
  \ \n- we did explain things and they are coming to church. No hard feelings between\
  \ us. \n\n- those who I decided to \"spare\" expressed anti-religious-events stances\
  \ in the past (not going to Christenings, First Communions & Confirmations) so I\
  \ thought it translated to wedding ceremonies\n\n- i also thought it would be considerate\
  \ to not force them to come because of the sense of \"they invited me so i have\
  \ to\" and ended up going wrong about it :/"

  ceremony?
