selftext: "I am getting married in a few weeks and have my bridal party primed and\
  \ ready, but had a huge disagreement with one of them yesterday. \n\nHer name is\
  \ Tara, and she is stunning. She's legit the prettiest out of our entire group.\
  \ Absolutely gorgeous. However, there is one issue. Tara has terrible vision. She\
  \ needs very strong glasses and even with them on her eyesight is bad. She gets\
  \ the lenses thinned down as much as possible and even then they are so thick you\
  \ can't see her eyes behind them. Her eyes can't tolerate contacts.\n\nIn our ''bridal\
  \ meeting'' yesterday, I asked if it was possible for Tara to take off her glasses\
  \ during the main photos. I wasn't saying this to be cruel. I'd never ask her to\
  \ take them off during the wedding party and walk around blind, but I'm just asking\
  \ her to take them off during photos. Without those glasses she's absolutely breathtakingly\
  \ beautiful, way more than me, but with them on her eyes look weird and distorted\
  \ and would take all the attention away in the photos for all the wrong reasons.\n\
  \nI brought this up with her but she got really huffy and sulky, told me to try\
  \ on her glasses so I could see what she would be seeing during the photos if she\
  \ took them off. I did and it was horrible, but I could stomach it for a few minutes\
  \ to help out a friend and think she's being really unreasonable. She left early\
  \ and the rest of the bridal party got at me for asking something so ''horrible''.\
  \ I don't think it's an unreasonable thing to ask. I'm doing her a favour. Without\
  \ the glasses she'll easily be the hottest bridesmaid so I would have thought she'd\
  \ be OK with it."
