selftext: "I was at a diner this morning, eating alone because I'm traveling for work.\
  \ It was absolutely packed and there was a family at the table next to me. Two college\
  \ girls and their parents, it looked like.\n\nThe waitress came by their table and\
  \ asked if they wanted coffee or water refills and the mom asked for more of both\
  \ for everyone. Kind of rudely, I thought. The dad made some joke about how it's\
  \ amazing how coffee just shows up, it must be magic or elves. \n\nYeah it was about\
  \ as awkward as it sounds. \n\nShe came by my table and asked if I needed anything,\
  \ and I asked for maple syrup, but \"no rush, because it's mad busy here and it's\
  \ not like you've got magical elves or some shit helping you out\" \n\nI know the\
  \ family next to me heard because the daughters started laughing about it, and the\
  \ dad was glaring daggers at me when I ate my breakfast. \n\nAITA, reddit?"
