selftext: 'Hi so I turned 22 yesterday, and I''ve made it clear to my entire family
  that I didn''t want a party, in fact I''ve never had a party, not for my 16th or
  18th, or 21st I hate attention being on me.

  so on Saturday my dad told me he wanted to take me to my favorite bar and I thought
  that would be a decent compromise to wanting to be alone. however when we walked
  into the door, there was my entire family and friends all standing there and they
  already had me a drink poured. because I''d spent the last 6 months telling my familiy
  I did not want a party, I just turned around and walked right out the front door
  and straight back to my apartment (about a 15 minute walk) and I ordered chinese
  takeout and went to sleep. I woke up to over 50 texts from various family members
  telling me how ungrateful I was and how I made my parents cry, and I even got a
  text from one of my family members who had visited from overseas who I wasn''t aware
  was at the party, I apologized to him for having a wasted journey and told him we
  could hangout one day after work if he wanted, and I resolved that issue. however
  the rest of my family now will not talk to me and my mom is demanding an apology.
