selftext: 'My gf has been telling me that the things I say to her come off bad and
  I need to "speak my mind" less and be a little bit more respectful. I was telling
  her the other day about how my friend wants kids within the next 2 years and she
  goes "it is crazy to think some people older than us, like him are having kids,
  since I still feel like a kid myself."


  I  then go "not everyone who is 22 feels like a kid." She got mad at me for this
  and asked why I feel the need to basically  make her feel bad about what she thinks?
  She said I was basically invalidating her/saying something rude as a comeback. Our
  friend who said he wants kids is 30 years old, if that helps.


  Idk. Am I the asshole?'
