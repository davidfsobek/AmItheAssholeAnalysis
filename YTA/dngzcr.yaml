selftext: "My brother seems to think I was an ass, but my sister says otherwise, so\
  \ I want some input on this situation.\n\nI (32M) went to a birthday party my sister\
  \ (28F) was having for her daughter with my little brother (17M) and all of our\
  \ family. We're a really big family, so there were a ton of people there. \n\nIt\
  \ was my nieces birthday and she was turning 3. For a game, my sister bought a bunch\
  \ of canvases and paint for all the kids and held an art contest. Every adult (who\
  \ had cash) had to pitch in at least $1 for the prize. First place would get $15,\
  \ second was $10, and third was $5. All the adults would vote on the best piece.\n\
  \nMy brother wanted to participate because art is basically his main hobby. Him\
  \ being the oldest and most skilled, I knew he'd win and just beat all the other\
  \ kids. So while everyone was voting, all the kids had to go away so it was a surprise\
  \ to them. During this, I told everyone to not vote on my brothers piece because\
  \ he's the oldest and most skilled, which isn't fair to any of the other kids. (Mostly)\
  \ Everyone agreed and we all decided to vote for all the little ones.\n\nAfter everyone\
  \ came back, birthday girl won first place, my nephew (7) got second, and my cousin\
  \ (11F) got third. \n\nOnce we all left, my brother told me he overheard me telling\
  \ everyone to purposely not vote for him and he said it was an asshole move. I told\
  \ him he probably only wanted the cash prize and participated only because he knew\
  \ he'd beat all the other kids. He said whatever and called me a douche. I told\
  \ my sister about this and she said it was fair, and our brother was just being\
  \ greedy."
