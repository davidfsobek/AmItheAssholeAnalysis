selftext: "I went back and forth on whether or not I should post this because I know\
  \ it\u2019s a sensitive topic for a lot of people. My wife and I are planning a\
  \ trip to Disneyland and we want our kids to really enjoy the experience. My wife\
  \ thought of going to the makeover booth in the park to get our 2 y/o daughter a\
  \ princess makeover. When our son heard about this, he wanted to get a princess\
  \ makeover also. My wife happily agreed but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good\
  \ idea.\n\nNow before everyone starts attacking me for defending gender norms, I\
  \ want to clarify that I have nothing wrong with my son dressing up and expressing\
  \ himself. I just don\u2019t want to set him up for failure. I don\u2019t think\
  \ a 4 y/o is emotionally ready to handle people in public shaming him for not following\
  \ their beliefs. \n\nIt\u2019s easy to say \u201Cscrew those people!\u201D but the\
  \ reality is they exist and letting my son dress up as a princess is opening the\
  \ door for that kind of criticism and hate.\n\nJust to give a little more background\
  \ on my reasoning, my wife and I recently went to \u201Cbuild a bear\u201D for a\
  \ birthday stuffed bear. My son picked out a pink stuffed kitten and when we got\
  \ in line this rude guy in front of us huffed and said \u201Cglad I didn\u2019t\
  \ have a boy so I don\u2019t have to deal with THAT\u201D. I told him to mind his\
  \ own business but my son was visibly upset. If we put him in a dress around Disneyland\
  \ I\u2019d expect there to be at least one asshole to make a scene and ruin the\
  \ day for our son. \n\nAITA for not wanting my son to get a princess makeover a\
  \ Disneyland?\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for the responses! I\u2019m willing to\
  \ admit I\u2019m projecting and letting my own insecurities get in the way of him\
  \ having a good time, and your comments helped me realize that. I\u2019m going to\
  \ let my wife know and we\u2019ll go through with it if my son is still interested.\n\
  \nEdit 2: I know there is a knight/pirate package. He wants the princess makeover."
