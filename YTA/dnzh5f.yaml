selftext: 'I have been with Eli for about 6 moths. She is a VERY opinionated woman.
  She studies political science and is very informed about everything that''s happening.
  I love to listen to her political rants and so on.


  Recently we decided that we were ready to take the next step and introduce each
  other to our families. She introduced me first and her family was a delight. I kept
  topics like politics and religion to myself and so did they.


  Then Friday it was my turn. My parents are Christians and rather conservative. I
  don''t agree with many of their POVs but I don''t bring it up.


  We sat down to eat and my parents asked her normal questions. They then asked her
  if she goes to church on Sundays. My gf says that she is an atheists so it would
  be hypocritical. I squeezed her hand a little because for me a simple no would have
  sufficed. But now my mom was "debating her". I managed to make them drop the issue.


  But then my dad made an offhand comment about how he agrees with something trump
  said and my gf said that she saw that statement as offensive. Soon they were discussing
  it all. I tried to make her stop but she wouldn''t drop the topic.


  When we left I told her she should keep her opinion to herself when we see my parents.
  Politics and religion have nothing to do at the dinner table. She called me an asshole
  and left alone and hasn''t talked to me since. AITA??


  Edit : no I didn''t tell my parents off. I respect them enough. And the conversation
  was never un polite. It was very tense but in her defense she never raised her voice
  but neither did my parents



  Edit2: I don''t remember which statement they were talking about but it had to do
  with the turkish'
