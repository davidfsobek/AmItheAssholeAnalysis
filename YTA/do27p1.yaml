selftext: "My sons are 4 and 7 right now, and we aren't having any more.  My wife\
  \ and I have a very strong bond.  We do, however, come from very different financial\
  \ backgrounds -- I came from a blue collar background while her father was a very\
  \ well off attorney.\n\nMy younger sister just had her first kid, a boy, and money\
  \ is tight, as it almost always is in that situation.  We had all of our baby clothes\
  \ in a storage bin in the back of our garage, neatly labeled and organized.  A few\
  \ days after my nephew was born, I was in the garage, saw that bin, and decided\
  \ to drive it over to my sister's house and help her out in that way.  IMO baby\
  \ clothes are cheap and disposable since they're prone to getting messed up anyway.\n\
  \nWell, a month goes by and my wife noticed that the bin is missing and flips out.\
  \  She calls me at work in a huff, demanding to know where I \"hid\" them.  I told\
  \ her that I gave them to my sister and didn't think anything of it.\n\nWell my\
  \ wife demanded that I leave work early, drive to my sister's house \"before any\
  \ more damage is done\" and take the clothes back.  She goes into a rant about how\
  \ in her family, they keep baby clothes forever as keepsakes, how her mom still\
  \ has her and her sister's baby clothes, how their grandma still has all of theirs,\
  \ etc and how she NEEDS them back.  This was news to me.  I personally think it's\
  \ ridiculous since they're just clothes that she got at Target etc and that they're\
  \ much better served in use.  In my family, we pass baby clothes down to the newest\
  \ baby that's born, passing them to siblings, cousins, or even friends who have\
  \ had kids.\n\nWell I was pissed off at how she came at me on the issue, like I\
  \ did something terrible to her, and she wouldn't even look at how much they'd help\
  \ out my sister and brother in law.  So I told her no, I wouldn't ask for them back\
  \ and she told me that I HAD to and I said no.  \n\nI admit that I should've asked\
  \ her first but like I said, everyone in my family shares baby clothes around. \
  \ She refuses to call my sister because she \"shouldn't have to.\" \n\nI haven't\
  \ been home yet, it's 6:30 here and TBH I'm just gonna work late to push the argument\
  \ and hope she cools off.\n\nTLDR: Gave away my sons' old clothes, wife demanded\
  \ them back, I said no.  AITA?"
title: AITA for not backing up my wife when she asked for baby clothes back from my
  sister?
