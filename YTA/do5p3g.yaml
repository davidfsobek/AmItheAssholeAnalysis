selftext: "One night after quite a few drinks at a night club. I met a girl who had\
  \ mutual friends though I'd never heard of her before and ended up taking her back\
  \ to my place (Was living with my mum at the time) for a one night stand.. Unprotected...\
  \ Stupid I know but at the time I was drunk and just wanted to smash. The next morning\
  \ I made up some excuse for her to leave and intended on never seeing her again.\n\
  \nA few months go by and I've now rekindled a previous love, we're living together\
  \ and things are going great. Then we find  out my partner is pregnant and we're\
  \ escatic planning for the future. Next thing you know I get a message from an unknown\
  \ number, and its that girl I had a one night stand with saying we need to talk.\
  \ First thing I did was let my partner know what was going on. We talked things\
  \ through before I messaged the  girl back and letting her know I was in a happy\
  \ relationship and I didn't want her to go through with the pregnancy and would\
  \ prefer she got an abortion (As politely as possible). She was unsure what she\
  \ was going to do but assured me if she was going to go through with it I wouldn't\
  \ have to be involved and it would be her child alone and wouldn't expect any form\
  \ of involvement or support from me. I agreed and that was the last I've spoken\
  \ to her even to this day.  We live in a very secular country so early abortion\
  \ isn't nearly as frowned upon as other countries. \n\nWeeks go by and my girlfriend\
  \ and I are attending a scan and everything seems fine, we're advised the heart\
  \ rate was low and asked to come back in 2 weeks for a follow up. When we returned\
  \ for the follow-up the baby was gone. This was extremely emotional and traumatic\
  \ for the both of us, especially my partner and she dealt with a great deal of depression\
  \ following. Especially when her body failed to eject the remains and had to go\
  \ in for an abortion surgery to manually remove everything. \n\nMonths go by and\
  \ we've moved countries to start a new life together. Within a month of arriving\
  \ \nI find out the one nighter had turned up at my mother's to introduce a 1 month\
  \ old child. My mother is happy and excited. My girlfriend is heartbroken feeling\
  \ like she failed in providing that grandchild. \n\n I say to my mother look, I'm\
  \ in a whole other country. I have no interest in being involved in this child's\
  \ life, I'm not even listed on the birth certificate, but if you want to be involved\
  \ in this child's life.. So be it. I just ask you respect my partner and I's wishes\
  \ by keeping it to yourself. \n\nShe agreed initially, but over time things changed.\
  \ Suddenly my mothers bringing the child to family gatherings, plastering photos\
  \ and statuses all over Facebook. I can't help but feel like it's a huge kick in\
  \ the teeth to my partners feelings and my wishes. \n\nSo, AITA for hoping she'd\
  \ keep it to herself?\n\nEdit: I should probably point out my girlfriend has Polycystic\
  \ ovaries and had been advised by a doctor prior to the pregnancy that she wouldn't\
  \ be able to have children without medical assistance and a stroke a luck - Hence\
  \ why the baby meant so much to her and affected her so badly when she lost it."
