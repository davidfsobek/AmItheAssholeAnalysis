  \ approached by of one them to model for a class of 10 students. It paid and was\
  \ about an hour. \n\nI said sure. \n\nI later find out it\u2019s naked. I\u2019\
  m fine with that. I sign the forms. \n\nI go out there in a robe. See his friends.\
  \ Disrobe. Get comfy and pose. Hour later I get paid. Teacher thanks me. Talk to\
  \ his friends a bit. Look at the work and it\u2019s all good. \n\nLater bf and I\
  \ are at a friends place and he noticed a piece of art hanging up. And it\u2019\
  s my nude. He gets upset. Says I should have cleared it with him. His friends and\
  \ I try to calm him down. Saying it\u2019s art. Nothing wrong with it. Not sexual.\
