selftext: "Backstory:\n\nSo my son (15M) already has had hair loss. We don\u2019t\
  \ know why or how, but the whole top of his head has no hair. He has a really bad\
  \ bald spot. It occurred over the summer. He just has some on the lower back of\
  \ his head and everywhere but the top of his head. We bought him a durag to wear\
  \ to cover up his bald spot. He wore it to school, and the principal yanked it off\
  \ his head and confiscated it. He then called us in for a meeting about my son\u2019\
  s behavior (wearing the durag), calling it \u201Cinappropriate\u201D. I told him\
  \ my son had alopecia and just wanted to cover up his bald spot. The principal wouldn\u2019\
  t budge, so I chewed him out. I was pissed that my son had to go to school looking\
  \ like that, since he\u2019s already pretty embarrassed about having the bald spot\
  \ in the first place. AITA for chewing out the principal?\n\nEDIT: so I\u2019m gonna\
  \ point this out: I had a doctor\u2019s note and showed it to the principal (school\
  \ policy states you can wear headgear with a doctor\u2019s note) but the principal\
  \ didn\u2019t budge\n\nEDIT 2: I\u2019ve confirmed it with the doctor they say it\u2019\
  s alopecia"
