selftext: 'I''m a 31 year old single guy who lives alone in an apartment complex.
  I''ve lived there for 6 years. My neighbor across the hall, a woman around my age
  or a little younger (I actually don''t know her first name but I''ll call her Katie)
  lives across the hall from me diagonally and has for about 2 years. We exchange
  hellos but aren''t friendly, which is how it is with most of my neighbors.


  So I don''t know how to cook, and due to losing one of my part time gigs, I don''t
  have as much money for takeout anymore. I''m getting really sick of eating cheap
  fast food or box mac and cheese. I''m gaining weight and I never feel great.


  This is where Katie comes in. I can always smell her cooking in the hall and it
  always smells amazing (I know it isn''t the other person at our end of our hall
  cause it''s a single old man). I''ve even complimented it a few times. So I got
  the idea that I''d offer to give her some money each week to cook a little extra
  and bring it over to me (or I can pick it up from her!) at night. She''s cooking
  anyway and then I''d have varied presumably delicious food.


  I asked her the next time I saw her and she looked surprised and said she couldn''t
  because she was too busy (which didn''t make sense cause she cooks almost every
  day but okay). The next time I saw her a few days later, I asked her if she was
  sure and upped the amount I was offering, and she said she was sure and that it
  was rude to ask me, and that she isn''t a housekeeper for hire and I should get
  a housekeeper if that''s what I want. She also called me ''a stranger'' even though
  we have talked in the halls before.


  Overall she made me feel like a big jerk and really embarrassed for even asking
  her, and a little mad because she was acting like I was being creepy (I wasn''t,
  trust me, she isn''t my type). I think asking her to split cooking wasn''t completely
  outlandish, since she cooks every day anyway and it wouldn''t be hard to make a
  little more.


  So, AITA?


  EDIT: People keep assuming I''m sexist because I didn''t think it was the old man
  who lives on our hall cooking. It''s not an assumption for me. He and I have lived
  across from each other for 6 years. The cooking smells didn''t start til she moved
  in, and I''ve talked to her about how good her cooking smells before.


  EDIT: Okay. It is abundantly clear that I was the asshole and asking her was inappropriate
  and, as much as I hate to admit it, creepy. My instinct is to apologize to her but
  since my instinct was to ask her in the first place, I''ll do the opposite and stay
  out of her hair. Thanks.'
