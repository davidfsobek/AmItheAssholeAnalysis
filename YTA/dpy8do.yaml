selftext: 'I''m the owner of a sporting/hunting goods store and for the autumn season
  we had a giveaway of a 5 minute shopping spree. It may not sound like much but it''s
  a small store and you could easily rack up $5,000-10,000 in goods in that time.
  The winner was chosen by purchasers of the month of October: you got a number on
  your receipt and we drew the winning number two nights ago with the spree happening
  today.


  The winner was announced on our Facebook page and a woman was the winner. Maybe
  mid-30s, I don''t know if that''s important. She doesn''t seem like the kind of
  person to go hunting or whatever but looks can be deceiving, we don''t judge. She
  posted on Facebook and it started a long comment chain between her and others, in
  public view of everyone else including myself and my employees, and the gist of
  the conversation was asking people what she should pick out to *maximize her profit
  selling the items on the secondary market*.


  Our rules are pretty lax, so much so we didn''t consider someone just picking up
  the most expensive things just to resell. I figured it''d give one lucky person
  a new kayak and some hunting gear, not someone picking up 50+ Yeti mugs. The resale
  market for most hunting stuff is pretty low but there''s some treasures in here
  that could easily be flipped for easy cash. One of our rules did apply: we reserved
  the right to rescind the giveaway offer at any time for any reason and without compensation.


  But that''s all beside the point (so far), just idle conversation doesn''t imply
  intent, but when she came in today to redeem her win, that''s exactly what she did.
  Straight to the Yeti cups. She even asked one of my employees "what do you think
  in here I could sell for the most money".


  When she got to the register, I was the one who handled her cart. And I decided
  to take away her win and instead hold a redraw next week for a new winner. She didn''t
  break any rules, but I was exercising my one rule to preserve the spirit of the
  competition. This woman doesn''t need this stuff, she wants cold hard cash. Why
  give her this reward when someone more deserving could get it? Someone who actually
  uses this stuff?


  It started an uproar on Facebook but I''m pleased to say most agree with how we
  handled it. There''s a vocal minority, however, and we''ve already been review bombed.
  Was I the asshole, though?'
