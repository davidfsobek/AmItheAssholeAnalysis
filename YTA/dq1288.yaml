selftext: "I\u2019ve been a single mother of two kids for seven years now. My daughter\
  \ is in her third year of college and my son is a senior in high school. I promised\
  \ them that I would financially support them fully through college, and after that,\
  \ they\u2019re on their own. My daughter called me up yesterday to tell me that\
  \ she plans on getting a breast augmentation surgery. Her first consultation is\
  \ in two weeks. She plans to pay for it with the money she has saved up through\
  \ the allowances I have continually given her since she was in elementary school.\
  \ She has never held a part-time job before. \n\n\nI tell her that her priority\
  \ should be focusing on her education to start a good career when she graduates.\
  \ The boob job can wait. If she goes through with it, I would stop paying for her\
  \ tuition, rent, and cut off her monthly allowance. She gets upset and complains\
  \ about getting her small boobs from me. She goes on to say that she expected I\
  \ of all people would support her decision, knowing firsthand the drawbacks of being\
  \ small-chested. I tell her that it really isn\u2019t that huge of an issue. It\
  \ might seem like one when you\u2019re younger, but it really isn\u2019t at all\
  \ in the big picture. I tell her my decision was final and that she should reconsider\
  \ the necessity of a boob job at this point in her life. WITBA if I stopped paying\
  \ for her college expenses if she goes through with it? Also AITA for how I handled\
  \ the conversation?"
