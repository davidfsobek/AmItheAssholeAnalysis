selftext: "Throwaway warning.\n\nOne of my neighbors who lives on my street is a literal\
  \ nightmare. She is with our homeowners association and seems to have a personal\
  \ grudge against me and a few other neighbors. Once my aunt came to visit, and she\
  \ parked right in front of my house. We live in a quiet suburban neighborhood, so\
  \ her car wasn't blocking the road at all and it is never busy, but my neighbor\
  \ took it upon herself to report it and I got faced with a hefty fine.\n\nShe will\
  \ always do other petty things, like if my wife and my kids walk our dog, sometimes\
  \ our neighbor will follow them behind to make sure they clean up after it, don't\
  \ walk on anyone's grass, it's ridiculous.\n\nThose are just a couple of examples,\
  \ on to the story. Now no one really respects my neighbor and I vowed if she comes\
  \ to the door I will straight up refuse to answer. Sure enough, she and her kids\
  \ come up to my door. I am looking from the window and the kids knock a few times\
  \ and look like they are going to give up, the mother comes up and knocks on my\
  \ door (She sees our cars in the drive way so she knows we're home). I relent and\
  \ answer and she badgers me \"how come you didn't answer, we've been here for 5\
  \ minutes\"\n\nHer kids interrupt her and cheerily say \"trick or treat,\" I wanted\
  \ to give them candy because they are fairly well behaved, but because their mother\
  \ is a nightmare, I say \"sorry, not giving you guys anything.\"\n\nThe mother flips\
  \ her shit and yells at me for not being in the spirit of Halloween and mentions\
  \ how she will embarrass me by telling everyone about how much of a \"scrooge\"\
  \ I am. They leave and I sit there FUMING. \n\nAfter a couple minutes I grab a few\
  \ candy bars, walk outside and find them a few houses down. I storm up to them,\
  \ throw the candy at their feet and yell at the mother \"here's the candy for your\
  \ fucking kids, enjoy it you old hag.\" She looked terrified because I did approach\
  \ them suddenly.\n\nI am not sure if I was the asshole here or not, my neighbor\
  \ has been nothing but rude to me for years and because I initially refused to give\
  \ her kids candy, I was somehow the bad guy?"
