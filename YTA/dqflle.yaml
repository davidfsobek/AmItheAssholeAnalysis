selftext: "In brackets/italics at the end of each paragraph is what my girlfriend\
  \ thinks I should add. The asshole will be paying the vet bill/replacing her stuff.\n\
  \nMy girlfriend (19) and I (23) have been dating for 4 months. She often stays at\
  \ my place since we live 45 minutes away and she doesn't drive, so when I pick her\
  \ up for dates it often gets late so we just crash at my place. Sometimes this results\
  \ in her staying for a few days since I work. [*She says she would rather go on\
  \ dates in her town and go home at the end of the night, but that I always make\
  \ reservations at places close to me and then am too tired to drive her home and\
  \ won't get up early enough before work to take her home, sometimes meaning she's\
  \ at my place for days in a row unintentionally and gets stuck in my room the whole\
  \ time since my roommate doesn't like visitors.*]\n\nToday she called my place of\
  \ work asking to speak to me saying my dog had just eaten a couple of her prescription\
  \ medications and she had already called the vet and they said it was a lethal amount\
  \ and the dog had to be brought in. She told me her mom was there and they'd drive\
  \ her to the vet, but to meet them there. \n\nThe vet ended up giving my dog medicine\
  \ to vomit, except she wouldn't vomit there and waited until she was in my car (when\
  \ me, girlfriend, and the dog were driving back to my place-- her mom went home)\
  \ to unload everywhere. She is okay now. I asked my girlfriend what happened and\
  \ she said that when her mom arrived (which I had no knowledge of and totally wouldn't\
  \ have been okay with her having people over without me there) the dog would not\
  \ stop barking and lunging for the door. My girlfriend has repeatedly said the dog\
  \ isn't safe which just isn't true, so she locked the dog in our bedroom. Apparently\
  \ while her mom was visiting, the dog chewed and destroyed all her things-- purse,\
  \ clothing, bag of toiletries, etc.. [*While she accepts nothing bad has ever happened,\
  \ she doesn't feel the dog is safe since she will lunge and growl and she doesn't\
  \ feel strong enough to keep control over the dog. She thought putting her in a\
  \ room was the safest way to handle things. Her mom was there to bring her medicine\
  \ and food, since I don't keep food at my place and don't want her eating my roommates\
  \ things. She also says I'm only mad about her mom visiting because I don't like\
  \ her.*]\n\nNot only did my girlfriend refuse to clean up the vomit, but she won't\
  \ pay me back for the vet bill and is asking me to pay half toward replacing her\
  \ items. I think it's just crazy because if she didn't have her mom over without\
  \ my permission, none of this would have happened. I ended up cleaning up the vomit,\
  \ but the vet bill and cost of replacing her stuff (estimated to be $650 total)\
  \ is up in the air."
