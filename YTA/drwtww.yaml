selftext: "My MIL has asked, on several occasions, for me to give her some of my daughter\u2019\
  s hair. I keep avoiding answering because she\u2019s never had a haircut and therefore\
  \ I don\u2019t have any to give. Her asking for my daughter\u2019s hair bothers\
  \ me for two reasons. \n\nFirstly I feel like she is wading into a mother\u2019\
  s territory. I know it\u2019s a visceral reaction. Saving your child\u2019s hair\
  \ is something a mother does (I have saved some of my daughter\u2019s hair for her\
  \ baby book).  That\u2019s mine. That\u2019s my ritual. Would my MIL having some\
  \ of my kids\u2019 hair therefore devalue the lock that\u2019s in her baby book?\
  \ Maybe I feel that way a little, but I am more upset that she is crossing a boundary\
  \ and inserting herself into something that was supposed to be between me and my\
  \ child.\n\nSecondly, she has not asked for a lock of my son\u2019s hair. Nor does\
  \ she have hair from her other two grandchildren. This shows favoritism that I cannot\
  \ abide. \n\nAITA? My husband says yes, my mother says no.\n\nEDIT: I want to clarify\
  \ a few things. I have cut and kept a small amount of hair that she needed trimmed\
  \ away from her eyes. But she has never had an all-over, formal haircut. In the\
  \ past when MIL has brought this up I have said that I kept some for her baby and\
  \ she replied that she just wanted to make sure that somebody kept some of it. This\
  \ time she said she wanted some to keep in a locket. However, each time she has\
  \ asked she\u2019s been kind of sheepish about it as if she knew she was asking\
  \ something that wouldn\u2019t willing be offered up. There have been a few boundary\
  \ issues before but on the whole I have a great relationship with my MIL. I don\u2019\
  t like to disappoint people but I feel very strongly on this issue.\n\nEDIT#2: MIL\
  \ definitely doesn\u2019t want it for a paternity test - my daughter looks just\
  \ like my husband."
