selftext: "Daughter is 16. Her mom and I are divorced.Daughter has been caught smoking\
  \ pot several times from the age of 14. Her mom and I have collectively punished\
  \ her several times for this. The last time we caught her, I started drug testing\
  \ her. Her mom doesn\u2019t agree with it, but we have caught her so many times\
  \ now that I think this is the best way to prevent her from doing it.\n\nI don\u2018\
  t normally go through her room, but the router for the house is in there, and I\
  \ needed to reset it. When I go into her room, I found a mushroom cap on black paper\
  \ hidden underneath her desk. I look up what the hell it is and it is a spore print\
  \ for magic mushrooms. I go through her room further to find an entire damn aqarium\
  \ filled with mushrooms in the back of her closet. obviously I am enraged, so I\
  \ wait for her to get back from school, and I called the police. She was arrested,\
  \ booked and released into her mother\u2019s custody.\n\nHer mother is pissed, and\
  \ saying that I may have ruined the kids life for no reason, but we have tried to\
  \ correct her drug abuse several times to no avail, and it has escalated. She now\
  \ has a court date and can answer to the law since she doesn\u2019t take the rules\
  \ in my house seriously. I doubt she\u2019ll get more than probation anyway.\n\n\
  My parents are also pissed though, saying that this could have been handled inside\
  \ the home, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m here. I\u2019m wondering if I over reacted\
  \ and would like a more impartial judgment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am making and edit\
  \ to respond to a few things.\n\nThis was a small ten gallon tank. I guess people\
  \ are picturing something larger. There were a lot of mushrooms in there though.\
  \ My daughter has a small walk in closet that is, honestly, so messy that I don\u2019\
  t bother to look in there too much. Because she has been passing her drug tests,\
  \ I have been cutting her slack. I honestly would not have called the police if\
  \ I thought that she was going to get a jail sentence at all."
