selftext: "My sons 10th birthday is next saturday and me and my husband have been\
  \ planned a party for him. To make sure we gave everyone enough time we got invitations\
  \ ready 2 weeks in advance and I had my son pass them out Friday. We invited every\
  \ one in his class (he goes to a small private school so there were only 15 kids\
  \ to invite). Except for one child well call david. \n\nThe school my son goes to\
  \ has a program for special needs kids where they are put into a \"normal\" class\
  \ once a week. David is a high functioning autistic child who was put in my sons\
  \ class to help him socialize and to help the other kids learn to not discriminate\
  \ against special needs people. From what I know about him and his mother they are\
  \ just doing their best, and I have nothing against either of them. However, there\
  \ have been incidents with david before. Last year through friends I had heard that\
  \ David had a meltdown at another party he was invited to. I don't know if I believe\
  \ it but parents who were there say that it was because he wanted to open presents\
  \ like the birthday boy and when told no freaked out. There are other logistical\
  \ problems as well (The party will be in a loud arcade) so in the end I decided\
  \ to not invite david. \n\nWell, after my son passed the invitations word spread\
  \ around that we had excluded the special needs child in his class. This got back\
  \ to davids mother who called me last night and confronted me about this. She told\
  \ me that I am awful for excluding her son and that i'm teaching my son to discriminate.\
  \ When I brought up the logistics and the past incident she told me that i'm an\
  \ asshole for assuming what her son can and cant do before hanging up. I woke up\
  \ this morning to a passive aggressive post by her and many other parents are siding\
  \ with her. \n\nI just want my son to have a good party and didn't mean anything\
  \ by this. AITA?"
title: AITA for inviting my sons entire class except for one child because of his
  autism?
