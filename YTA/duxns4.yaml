selftext: "So Thursday, I went to a party one of my friends threw. It was your pretty\
  \ standard college party and I got pretty drunk yada yada. When I went back to my\
  \ house, I was stumbling around trying to get to my room. One of my housemates helped\
  \ me to my room and told me to sleep it off which I planned to do. \n\n\nI don\u2019\
  t remember too much since I blacked out but this is what some of my housemates told\
  \ me. My roommate was in the room when I came in and he said I kept falling off\
  \ the bed and talking to myself. He ended up calling an ambulance for me and apparently\
  \ the EMTs forced me to go to the hospital and threatened to call the police if\
  \ I didn\u2019t go so I didn\u2019t have a choice. \n\nWhen I woke up in the hospital\
  \ the next morning, the nurse gave me papers to sign and then let me leave. They\
  \ also stuck me with a $1000 hospital bill for the ambulance. Since I was basically\
  \ dragged to the hospital, I left my keys and phone inside so I couldn\u2019t get\
  \ in. None of my housemates were home so I ended up just waiting outside of the\
  \ house for like an hour before one of them finally came back. On top of that, I\
  \ missed my CAD class which is a whole different story. \n\nI was absolutely pissed\
  \ with my roommate for calling me an ambulance. Not only did I end up spending the\
  \ night at some hospital, I got a $1000 bill on top of it too. It\u2019s one thing\
  \ if I had alcohol poisoning or something like that but I literally just slept at\
  \ the hospital and left the next morning. The housemate who helped me inside was\
  \ on my side, he said I was hammered but it wasn\u2019t that bad and I could just\
  \ sleep it off. The roommate said he got scared and didn\u2019t know they would\
  \ take me to the hospital but that just made me even more mad since there was like\
  \ 5 other people in the house at the time and his first reaction was to call the\
  \ police rather than ask the others. So AITA?\n\nEdit: I\u2019m not mad at my roommate\
  \ for calling the ambulance. If I looked that ducked up, I would probably do the\
  \ same. I\u2019m upset about the fact that calling the cops was his first instinct\
  \ rather than ask the other roommates. I mentioned my other housemate said I was\
  \ super drunk but I could sleep it off and my roommate instantly decided to call\
  \ the cops. I didn\u2019t get any tests at the hospital, I literally just slept\
  \ there for the night and left when I woke up. Some of the comments are correct\
  \ in that the American healthcare system is unfortunately part of the issue here.\
  \ I was willing to endanger myself rather than pay a $1000 bill I can\u2019t afford.\
  \ If that makes me TA, then so be it."
