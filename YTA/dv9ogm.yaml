selftext: 'My husband and I have been trying for pregnancy for years now, and to cut
  a long story short it seems as though it will never be a possibility. It took a
  long time to come to terms with but we''ve gradually got there. Our entire family
  is aware of the journey we''ve been on and how much it meant to us. With that in
  mind, my husband and I came to his sister (Sarah) with a proposal.


  Sarah is in her early 30s, unmarried, and vocally against having children of her
  own. Despite this we thought she might be open to the idea of a surrogate pregnancy
  on our behalf given she would not have to be involved in raising the child personally.
  My husband is extremely close to his family and the idea of the entire process of
  surrogacy being contained to his blood felt extremely important to him. With that
  closeness in mind, we did not feel it was out of order to ask this sort of question.


  We invited Sarah over for dinner and at the end of it laid out our request. We told
  her we had been saving over the years and would be willing to pay her as much as
  a regular surrogate would be paid (a pretty hefty fee so she would be able to take
  time off from work if it was required), help her out with everything she needed,
  plus we had no expectations that she must help raise the child just because she
  carried it. We told her why it was important to us and how much it''d mean, and
  asked her to have an open mind about it.


  Sarah exploded at us. She said we were both out of our minds for making such a request,
  extremely selfish, and that we had no respect for her disinterest in children. She
  actually left early. Right now she''s refusing to take calls from us and even went
  as far as to ask my husbands parents to tell us to both not contact her until she
  decides to initiate it herself. My husbands parents are sympathetic to us but say
  that we should have kept in mind Sarah''s difficulties. My parents think she is
  behaving awfully. Most of my friends are on my side but a few have said that it
  was a bit of a rude request given everyone knows how much Sarah hates kids.


  It''s really weighing on my mind and I honestly never expected this kind of outcome.
  She literally blocked us on every platform she could. Are we really the ones behaving
  like an asshole?'
