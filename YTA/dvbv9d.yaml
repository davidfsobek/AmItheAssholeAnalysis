selftext: " \n\nI'm not much of a cook tbh. Before I met my husband I used to survive\
  \ on one pan chicken dinners with veggies. Since I met him he started doing most\
  \ of the cooking. Recently I've been wanting to try some online recipes for more\
  \ advanced meals.\n\nToday I wanted to try making a basic crockpot beef stew. I\
  \ simply asked my husband to help out with cutting the veggies. He proceeded to\
  \ brown the meat. It kinda irked me because I wanted to brown the meat but I said\
  \ thank you.\n\nAnyway, I go to put the meat into the crockpot and I noticed he\
  \ spiced it with Montreal steak spice.... I told him that's not the spices that\
  \ go in this recipe! He knew I was following a recipe btw. The thing is EVERYTIME\
  \ I try to cook he HAS to add his own spice or something to it. Literally every\
  \ time. If this was a one time thing I wouldn't mind it could of been a mistake\
  \ or a suggestion. But at this point, it feels like he's undermining me. I literally\
  \ cook once every 3 months let me make something once in a while ffs.\n\nHis father\
  \ was supposed to come over for dinner tonight... I may have overreacted but I told\
  \ him to cancel dinner as I don't want to serve this crap and that he can eat this\
  \ stew by himself....\n\nFyi English is not my first language.\n\nEdit: hey I want\
  \ to thank you guys for your input. I felt like an asshole canceling dinner which\
  \ should of hinted on me being the asshole.  I will be talking to my husband and\
  \ apologizing for overreacting but I will also make sure he knows to stay away from\
  \ my cooking haha"
