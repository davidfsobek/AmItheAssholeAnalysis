selftext: "My roommate and I had some friends over after class, one of them being\
  \ a girl who\u2019s on the heavier side. She\u2019s super nice and all.\n\nI\u2019\
  m printing something for a project for my final and it\u2019s 2 parts. The first\
  \ part finished earlier that day and the second part is a 26 hour print. It had\
  \ been printing for 8 hours by the time everyone was over. \n\nWe are all standing\
  \ around talking and she gets near the printer walking backwards. She\u2019s been\
  \ over numerous times and while the printer isn\u2019t loud, it\u2019s not exactly\
  \ fucking quiet.\n\nI was gonna say something but I wanted to give her the benefit\
  \ of the doubt that she knew it was behind her.\n\nThen she stepped on it. Now it\u2019\
  s not in an enclosure but it was printing on the front of the bed so she didn\u2019\
  t damage anything that I know of.\n\nShe apologized and I said it was cool. I checked\
  \ the print and it was a little wonky, but figured it could have been like that.\
  \ 30 minutes later they leave to run to the store, and I check the print better.\
  \ It caused a significant shift in the layers, so the print is ruined. \n\nShe wasn\u2019\
  t there anymore but I was complaining about how that was 8 hours and material wasted.\
  \ I was upset, and I feel that\u2019s a normal reaction to this. My roommate started\
  \ telling me to chill out, which made me even more frustrated. He took the part\
  \ of the counter and threw it away.\n\nI grabbed it out of the trash can and started\
  \ seeing if maybe I could still use it somehow. I decided to Atleast see how my\
  \ diaroma will look with all the parts, so I start cleaning the supports off the\
  \ failure.\n\nI was upset when they came back over because that was 8 god damn hours\
  \ wasted, but she was already embarrassed and I didn\u2019t want to bring it up.\
  \ She did ask me if it was the failure I was working on and if she caused it, but\
  \ I said no and that I had made an error earlier and had to revise the model, as\
  \ to not be rude.\n\nMy roommate still thinks I\u2019m an asshole for being upset\
  \ and frustrated and for talking about it after she left. I was just trying to be\
  \ sensitive, and I can be a lot more freaked out that someone nearly ruined my very\
  \ expensive machine. \n\nAITA?"
