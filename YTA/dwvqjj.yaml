selftext: "Last edit:\n\nThank you for your judgments. Some of you were harsh, but\
  \ at the end of the day, it seems like you really just want this dog to have a good\
  \ home. My fianc\xE9 and I talked it through, and she gets my side and I get hers,\
  \ and that\u2019s that. I will no longer be interacting with this post as I think\
  \ the consensus is pretty clear that you guys think I\u2019m the asshole and I already\
  \ made up my mind. I\u2019ll leave it up because of the sub rules, but I won\u2019\
  t be reading any of your answers. \n\n\u2014  \n\nUPDATE: Met the dog. Dog and I\
  \ didn\u2019t really click (he\u2019s very drooly in real life which is a trait\
  \ I want to avoid and he doesn\u2019t seem to be the brightest dog in the world),\
  \ and I don\u2019t find him very cute still (NOTE: edited for clarity), but he kept\
  \ following my wife around and I feel bad for the guy cuz he seems attached to her.\
  \ I told her my strong preference is getting a different dog, but we can try and\
  \ find another home for him and if he doesn\u2019t have a home in the next few months,\
  \ we\u2019ll take him. \n\nPoint of clarification: the dog is staying with his foster\
  \ mom until our house is ready for a dog\n\n\u2014\n\nI know reddit is dog obsessed,\
  \ but please be objective. This situation has caused me so much stress to the point\
  \ it\u2019s starting to get ridiculous and I just want to know if others are on\
  \ my side. \n\nMy fianc\xE9 and I have been dating for 4 years. We both have kids\
  \ of our own, but we also wanted to start a family of our own, so we decided we\u2019\
  re going to start looking for a dog. We didn\u2019t have an extremely concrete timeline,\
  \ but knew we\u2019d be looking out for adoption events in the next few months.\
  \ \n\nMy fianc\xE9\u2019s friend (named L) fosters dogs, but she\u2019s going to\
  \ move within the next six months. My daughters (well, my fianc\xE9\u2019s daughters,\
  \ but they are so young they\u2019re like my own) spent last weekend spending time\
  \ with my L and met one of her foster dogs. \n\nMy daughters fell in LOVE with him.\
  \ My fianc\xE9, too. And on paper, he checks all the boxes. He\u2019s a large dog,\
  \ he\u2019s well trained, he\u2019s not too old (around 2) and he\u2019s also very\
  \ friendly. But... he\u2019s ugly. He\u2019s a Boxer mix, and has a smushed, droopy\
  \ face that\u2019s only cute on smaller dogs. \n\nA LOT of why we love dogs is how\
  \ cute they look. I don\u2019t think I can bond with a dog that doesn\u2019t make\
  \ me go \u201Caww\u201D inside, and I told my fianc\xE9 this. She was disappointed,\
  \ and she made me tell the girls, and they were as devastated as elementary school\
  \ kids can be. I told them we\u2019ll find another dog, maybe a lab, but they said\
  \ they only wanted this dog. My fianc\xE9 was upset, but I went through this phase\
  \ with my own kids when they were younger- they\u2019ll forget the dog exists in\
  \ a year. \n\nUntil yesterday, my fianc\xE9 was only slightly hinting at getting\
  \ the dog. But then her youngest came to her crying because her sister told her\
  \ they\u2019ll kill \u201Ctheir\u201D dog when he goes to the shelter. \n\nMy fianc\xE9\
  \ turned on me. She said we are ready to adopt a dog, that he\u2019s a good fit,\
  \ and her daughters REALLY want this. She suggests I meet him in person and don\u2019\
  t judge of pictures. \n\nBut I made up my mind. A dog is a big commitment, and no\
  \ one should be forced into having a dog they don\u2019t want. If you choose a lifelong\
  \ partner based on looks, it\u2019s not unreasonable to not make a long term commitment\
  \ with an ugly dog. My fianc\xE9 started pleading for this dog, and I told her I\u2019\
  ll think about it. \n\nNow I\u2019m at work writing this reddit post because she\
  \ texted me like three times today asking for an update. I plan to tell her no...\
  \ I don\u2019t want the dog and I don\u2019t want to meet him. I can\u2019t imagine\
  \ walking him and what my friends would say about him. Does this make me an asshole?\n\
  \ntl;dr: Fianc\xE9 and her kids want to get an ugly dog, I don\u2019t. AITA?\n\n\
  \n\u2014\n\nEDIT: to clarify some things, because people keep responding with questions\
  \ \n\n1) the dog isn\u2019t a replacement child per say... just a way to create\
  \ my family with my future wife in a way that doesn\u2019t involve a human life.\
  \ I don\u2019t think dogs are the same as humans. I would never stop loving my child\n\
  \n2) this is my first dog, which is why getting the best dog possible is important\
  \ to me\n\n3) My fianc\xE9\u2019s kids are 6 (edit: typo... she\u2019s not 7 yet)\
  \ and 10\n\n4) My kids don\u2019t know that I think their dog is ugly... I just\
  \ said I don\u2019t think this dog is a great fit and I had a different dog in mind.\n\
  \nEDIT 2: The dog isn\u2019t gonna get put down... that was my fianc\xE9\u2019s\
  \ 10 year old trying to get her sister to turn on me. He\u2019s getting fostered\
  \ for another 6 months by L... she\u2019ll likely find him another foster or permanent\
  \ home.\n\nEDIT 3: Meeting the dog tonight to give him a fair shake as others suggested.\
  \ Hopefully we click... if not then this will be a clusterfuck\n\nEDIT 4: [Here\u2019\
