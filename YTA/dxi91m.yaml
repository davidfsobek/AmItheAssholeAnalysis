selftext: 'My daughter recently got her first period. She immediately told her mom,
  and then her mom took her out to get pads and tampons. My son asked me where they
  went, and so I told him. He started talking about how it was gross, and I told him
  not to act that way, and that, if anything, he should be extra nice to his sister
  as this might be a hard time for her. I could tell when they got home that he was
  trying to be really nice. They usually fight constantly, but my son was actually
  giving his sister a lot of space, and just agreeing with her instead of arguing
  with her. I thought it was going great.


  But then, my son decided to tell some of his friends about it. I''m not sure exactly
  what went on at school, but my daughter claimed she was mortified. She and her brother
  have been fighting all week. My son is no longer trying to be nice. They''re fighting
  about everything under the sun, and my daughter is pissed that her brother even
  knows what is going on, and I feel awful that I was the one who told him, but at
  the same time, I would find it weird to intentionally try to hide it from him. AITA
  for telling him what was going on in the first place?'
