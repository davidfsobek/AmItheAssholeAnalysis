selftext: "Background: I'm a single father of a 18-year-old boy, my wife died in a\
  \ car accident a few years back. We had no other kids, so it's just me and him.\
  \ We get along pretty well and there has never been any major fights between the\
  \ two of us. I'm also a dentist, which we'll come back to later. We live in Finland,\
  \ close to Swedish border. \n\nSo a few days ago I was cleaning up his room, when\
  \ I found 30 cans of snus in his wardrobe. (it's illegal in Finland, but not in\
  \ Sweden so it's pretty easy to get) I was very disappointed, because the most illegal\
  \ thing he has done before was having a couple of beers with his friends whem he\
  \ was 16, which he told me about the next day. \n\nWhen he came home I of course\
  \ asked him what's the deal with that, he told me that it's not for him, he just\
  \ drives to Sweden (around 100km) every now and then, buys a large amount of snus,\
  \ and sells it to other students in his school for twice the price. I wasn't sure\
  \ if what he told was true, so I decided to check his gums, and it was pretty clear\
  \ that he didn't use snus himself.\n\nNow here's the controversial part, I told\
  \ him that as long as he doesn't start using snus himself, and saves at least half\
  \ of the profit he makes, I'm ok with him keeping doing that. Our money is a bit\
  \ tight, and he's making around 50\u20AC a week and has decent grades, so as long\
  \ as it doesn't escalate to more serious drugs I'm ok with it.\n\nEdit: by illegal\
  \ I mean if you cross the border with car full of snus and a police happens to check\
  \ the car, which has never happened to me, you can be fined."
