selftext: Ok so I'm in a d&d group with about 9 people. Two of the people in the group
  are dating  (Sal and Maria). It just came out that Sal cheated on Maria. This prompted
  Maria to dump sal even though sal wanted to try to make things work.  Thing is though
  Maria can't even stand being in the same room as Sal now (Sal's fine) which has
  led Maria to ask us to stop inviting Sal to our biweekly d&d sessions for the time
  being. The problem is that the people in the group are closer and have known sal
  for much longer and we told maria that she would just have to deal with it. This
  caused her to fip out over text so we kicked her from the groupchat and told her  she
  couldn't come to d&d anymore as long as she is this emotional. I told my siter what
  happened and she made me feel like shit. So reddit aita?
