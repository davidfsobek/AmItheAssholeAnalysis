selftext: "Basically, I think everyone\u2019s overreacting.\n\nI\u2019m 23 and I got\
  \ incredibly drunk at a party two weekends ago and ended up with alcohol poisoning.\
  \ I do relatively drink a lot, but only in social settings. \n\nI spent the rest\
  \ of weekend in the hospital recovering. It was a one time stupid mistake. \n\n\
  Yesterday, I went over to my parent\u2019s house for dinner. \n\nWhen I walked in,\
  \ they were all sitting in the living room with somebody I\u2019d never seen before.\n\
  \nI asked what was going on and my brother told me to sit down. I did and the man\
  \ I didn\u2019t know started talking. \n\nTo summarize, he said that my family was\
  \ worried for me and wanted me to go to treatment.\n\nI got upset and said that\
  \ everyone was being over dramatic and that this was ridiculous. I said that I realized\
  \ that I had made a mistake drinking that much but this was overkill. I stood up\
  \ and walked out at that point. \n\nMy mom ran out after me with the interventionist\
  \ and said that they only did this because they loved me. \n\nI said that everyone\
  \ was acting crazy and I hopped in my car and went home. \n\nMy brother has been\
  \ texting me begging me to reconsider but I haven\u2019t answered. \n\nEveryone\
  \ is crazy overreacting. Getting that drunk is not a normal thing for me. It just\
  \ happened once and I regret it. I have a good job and I look after myself. I don\u2019\
  t think I need rehab or that intervention. \n\nThat said, maybe I did handle the\
  \ intervention the wrong way. I maybe could\u2019ve responded in a way that made\
  \ them feel better instead of blowing up. \n\nAITA for walking out?"
