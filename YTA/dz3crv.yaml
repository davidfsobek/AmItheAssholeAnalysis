selftext: "One day my sister asked about some of my coworkers that she knew. I told\
  \ her I wasn't really friends with them because they were like her. She asked me\
  \ to elaborate and I told her that they were in sororities and heavy partiers while\
  \ I was more of a close friend group hang-out type of person. She then asked if\
  \ she and I would be friends if we weren't siblings and I said no. I honestly thought\
  \ it wasn't a big deal, I didn't say she was a bad person but just that we were\
  \ different. My mother said I really hurt her feelings but I soon forgot about it\
  \ thinking nothing of it. \n\nAfter a bit, my sister \"confronted\" me saying she\
  \ was disappointed I didn't apologize and that this had irrevocably changed our\
  \ relationship. I knew she was mad but I didn't feel I was in the wrong and she\
  \ never told me she was hurt it only came from second parties. I think it's wrong\
  \ to apologize because I think it is just a misunderstanding but she is too \"disappointed\"\
  \ to hear my point of view but my family thinks I am to blame for this even after\
  \ hearing my argument. Am I the asshole?"
