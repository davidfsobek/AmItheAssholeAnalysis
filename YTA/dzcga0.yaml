selftext: "My (21m) six year old sister makes it hell when I ask her to wear a seatbelt.\
  \ If someone especially a kid, ie my own little sis, doesn't wear a seatbelt in\
  \ the car, I get very anxious. My parents have done everything to get her to put\
  \ it on from explaining the importance to grounding her but she still makes it a\
  \ headache to put on a seatbelt.\nI am thinking about approaching a police buddy\
  \ and asking him to pull me over and specifically have a \"strict\" talk with her.\
  \ My mom supports this extreme measure but I am wondering if IWBTA as this could\
  \ be a traumatizing event for her. In addition, I am not even sure if it could be\
  \ construed as an abuse of power for my police buddy.\n\nEdit 1.  A I cannot believe\
  \ that this post blew up that much. After carefully reading all your guy's comments,\
  \ I have decided not to do what was originally planned. Mind you, my buddy was not\
  \ gonna tell at her, she is a six year old after all. I asked her if there was a\
  \ reason she does not like seatbelts and she mentioned it hurts her stomach so I\
  \ am going to be looking for alternative straps. In addition, like someone recommended\
  \ I am going to ask my friend to give her a tour of a police car\n and to gently\
  \ remind her that seatbelts at awesome.\n\n To the people leaving nasty PM's about\
  \ me abusing my lil sister, Why? This sub exists for situations like this where\
  \ you are not sure and ask others for judgement."
