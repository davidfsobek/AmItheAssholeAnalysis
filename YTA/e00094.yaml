selftext: "I worked in a tight knit pharmacy for a big Midwest chain store for 3 years.\
  \ I got along with everyone. People actually liked working with me for some reason.\
  \ For my last year there I had to cut back to part time because I was finishing\
  \ my masters. My last day of work was a Saturday and I had been telling everyone\
  \ 'this is my last month', 'this is my last week', 'last time I'll see our weekly\
  \ stats'. So that Saturday comes around I show up to work as usual and it's just\
  \ another day. The openers go to leave, see you tomorrow, and I say 'nope, last\
  \ day I'll see you never.' They all just kind of stare at me; bewildered. 'I didn't\
  \ know that', 'When did this happen?'. Even the pharmacist didn't know. The rest\
  \ of that day I was so depressed I hid in the bathroom every half hour because I\
  \ was in tears. I waited until the end of the day to 'pass judgement' and no one\
  \ came around to say goodbye. There wasn't even a card. When I got home I decided\
  \ that I wouldn't talk to them after that because they made it clear that I wasn't\
  \ even significant enough to remember to put together a goodbye card.\n\nA week\
  \ after that the head pharmacist asked me to come in because they wanted to give\
  \ me something. I straight up told her that pharmacy makes me feel sick because\
  \ they all forgot about me and my last day and I didn't want to go back for anything.\n\
  \nTo add to this, there's a total of 10 people that work there. Everytime an employee\
  \ passed through, even the interns that were there for a week, they at least put\
  \ together a card. So I personally felt insulted when one of the pharmacists who's\
  \ there full-time forgot about my last day.\n\nEDIT: to be clear, what the pharmacist\
  \ wanted to give me was the copy of my license they kept on the wall, not a gift.\n\
  \nEDIT: Jesus I didn't think people would care at all. Let me clarify some things:\
  \ we regularly hung out after work before I went for my masters. They regularly\
  \ said I was a close friend outside of work. I worked my ass off every minute I\
  \ was there. And I get it, me crying in the stalls is childish, but I felt heartbroken\
  \ for being forgotten after three years. I couldn't help it. They just happened.\
  \ But I kept hiding because I didn't want to cry in front of customers or my coworkers.\
  \ And again, there was never a gift, they just wanted to give me a copy of my license\
  \ that they had. I reduced my hours over the course of a year. My expectation for\
  \ my last day was a farewell. No party, no potluck. \n\nI apologized to my pharmacist\
  \ today and she apologized for forgetting about it. All the full timers were at\
  \ a weekend party and forgot."
