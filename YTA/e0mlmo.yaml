  (46/M) went on a trip with my sons (17/M,18/M) last weekend. My daughter (15/F)
  and my wife stayed at home.


  My daughter wanted to come but I told her she couldn''t since this was a bonding
  activity for me and my sons. She got very angry and called me sexist and told me
  she hated me and that I was a bad father. She told me that my father-som bonding
  moments ar bullshit and that it isn''t fair that she doesn''t get to come. (She
  is kinda oversensitive to "sexism", for example, if I don''t let her do certain
  things (like going to the mall, arriving home late, getting a motorcycle) e always
  angrily asks if I would let her do it if she was born male, and she frequently accuses
  me of favoring my sons because of their gender


  She kept on trying to convince me until we left. When we arrived home she didn''t
  greet us and didn''t say hi to us. She is sulking when I am at home (my wife says
  she doesn''t do this when I am not). She is sometimes mean to her brothers and resents
  them. She says thing likes she hopes they had a bad time. She only talks to me when
  it is absolutely necessary or when she makes a comment(About this situation). When
  we talk about the trip, she gets mad and tells us that she doesn''t want to hear
  what she was excluded from. Her mother also thinks she is being unreasonable. We
  did things I knew she wouldn''t enjoy and I feel like she only does this because
  she wants to be the victim and be angry about something". Our relationship was already
  bad.


  AITA or is she overreacting?'
