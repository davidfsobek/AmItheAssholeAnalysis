selftext: "This happened earlier this year but I am still dealing with the aftermath.\
  \ I had been talking about having a baby for 2 years. I had a miscarriage in the\
  \ fall last year that was tough but I got through it with the support of my partner.\
  \ In the winter we found out we were pregnant. Due to the miscarriage, we were very\
  \ nervous to tell people. We wanted to wait until our 16 week check up. That week\
  \ was around my friends bday celebration (her actual bday was the following week\
  \ and she planned a bday trip with a group of friends)\nThe plan was to met at her\
  \ house and then head to a local bar to meet a few other friends. I obviously was\
  \ excited to tell my friends and was tired of lying about not drinking and didn\u2019\
  t want people to assume my pregnancy and ask. I\u2019m not a good liar and was just\
  \ honestly was ready for people to know. Before leaving the house we announced to\
  \ the bday girl, her husband, a friend and their roommate. My friend did not seem\
  \ happy for us but that\u2019s okay. I told my other close friend at the bar and\
  \ did not say anything to the bday girl family members. The night was awkward to\
  \ say the least and I was pretty hurt she was not excited for me. \nShe has ignored\
  \ me for a while. I organized a dinner with close friends shortly after and she\
  \ did not speak to me the whole time. I asked her to meet up to see what was going\
  \ on. She said she was pissed I announced on her day and she was having a tough\
  \ time and that was her time to vent and I stole the attention. \nI don\u2019t think\
  \ I stole any attention. We low key told my BEST friends and their husbands. I did\
  \ not steal attention away from her 31st bday at local dive bar. \n\nAm I an awful\
  \ friend/person? My baby is now a few months old and our friendship has not recovered.\
  \ Currently, not on speaking terms still."
