selftext: "My [30sM] girlfriend [30sF] is super sweet. She also likes the nice things\
  \ in life which causes her to have car payments, high rent, etc. this leads to her\
  \ taking too many jobs including ones she\u2019s unqualified for.\n\nLast week she\
  \ got accepted as a manager at the store despite having no experience managing people.\
  \ I knew this would be a problem so I\u2019ve been helping her out (I\u2019ve got\
  \ plenty of work but go to hers and do what needs to be done to keep things running\
  \ smoothly). It should be simple but she\u2019s sleep deprived already high strung\
  \ and hurting from a physically demanding job and it causes problems.  Example,\
  \ we open in 10 minutes this morning and we have a million things to do, count the\
  \ registers, open doors, read reports etc. and  she\u2019s like \u201Cwindex the\
  \ counters!!\u201D... and I told her that that is the last and minuscule thing to\
  \ be done, we need to focus on the bigger things. This hits a nerve and at lunch\
  \ is crying to me why I\u2019m not helping her.  So I\u2019m like this is a bad\
  \ idea, I\u2019m just gonna go home, you run the show. I just got a text telling\
  \ me everything\u2019s falling apart like I said it would and begging me to come\
  \ to the store. But why go? She\u2019s not gonna listen to any advice I give her.\
  \ So I\u2019m sitting on the couch watching football. \xAF\\_(\u30C4)_/\xAF\n\n\
  Also, at lunch I told her I would manage everyone and everything tand she blew up\
  \ saying she will not be a manager only in title. She\u2019s bad at it and unwilling\
  \ to learn.\n\nEDIT: I don\u2019t care and didn\u2019t ask for the promotion because\
  \ I have my main other job I work 50+ hours a week. I work this because it\u2019\
  s easy, fun, and enjoyable.\n\nEDIT 2: she overstayed last night 2 hours to do the\
  \ dishes after \u201Cshe didn\u2019t feel comfortable asking the others to help\
  \ clean\u201D and let them go home. So at 1 am I am helping her load dishes into\
  \ the dishwasher because she also brought some home lol. So forgive me reddit world,\
  \ but this is why I don\u2019t think she\u2019s the greatest at managing. And if\
  \ y\u2019all understand, it\u2019s hard for me to sit her down and say \u201Cyou\u2019\
  re bad at this\u201D I also don\u2019t want to toss her to the wolves and let her\
  \ be fired in the near future.\n\nEDIT 3: A bunch of people have called off today.\
  \ She\u2019s asking me to come in on my day off. If this was just any manager I\
  \ would tell them politely to kick rocks."
