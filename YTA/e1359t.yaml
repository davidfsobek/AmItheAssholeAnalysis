selftext: "I\u2019ve been dating my girlfriend for 4 years, living together for one\
  \ year now. We\u2019re both 26. Our relationship has been great for the most part\
  \ but I noticed that since we moved in together my girlfriend has been talking more\
  \ and more about having children, her Pinterest is filled with stuff about baby\
  \ clothes, nursery decorating and raising kids (as well as tons of wedding stuff).\
  \ She follows a lot of family accounts on Instagram she would once in a while send\
  \ me videos of kids and say \u201Clol this is totally our future kid) \n\nI was\
  \ very adamant  that I wanted to wait until we could afford a house, pay off some\
  \ debts and establish our careers  before getting married and then we would have\
  \ kids. She just finished her masters and I finished physiotherapist school and\
  \ would love to start my own physiotherapy business in the future. She always agreed\
  \ that we weren\u2019t ready for kids but it was obvious she had intense baby fever.\
  \ My girlfriend is on birth control and takes the depo provera shot every 3 months.\
  \ \n\n3 days ago my girlfriend tells me that she\u2019s 2 months pregnant and she\
  \ just found out. I was absolutely shocked. Honestly I suggested an abortion at\
  \ this point but my girlfriend was adamant against it and said she was pretty excited\
  \ for the baby and was mad I was even suggesting abortion. \n\nSo honestly,  I did\
  \ accuse her of intentionally getting pregnant because it honestly just made the\
  \ most sense. She was acting so excited like it was planned, her past behaviour\
  \ showed she was looking forward to a baby and I never followed up to make sure\
  \ she was getting all her shots. She had been on the same form of birth control\
  \ our entire relationship with barely a pregnancy scare and suddenly she\u2019s\
  \ pregnant? \n\nWhen I accused her of getting pregnant on purpose she got mad at\
  \ me and says she would have never done that and she knows that it isn\u2019t the\
  \ perfect time to have a child and she been getting all her depo shots but \u201C\
  God had other plans\u201D and we could make it work. I again accused her of lying\
  \ and this was just too much of a coincidence. \n\nWe argue back and forth and she\
  \ gets really angry and runs away to her moms house.  She then texts me a picture\
  \ of a receipt for her most recent depo shot 9 weeks ago with the caption \u201C\
  you are a fucking asshole\u201D. She blocked me and refuses to respond to any of\
  \ my messages. \n\nI already apologized many times but I honestly don\u2019t think\
  \ I was the asshole to question her intentionally getting pregnant. From my point\
  \ of view it made sense. I really hope we can make this work but am I really the\
  \ asshole here, when looking at my perspective of the situation?"
