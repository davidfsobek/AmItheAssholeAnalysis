selftext: "My son Ian\u2019s 12th birthday was last Friday. The number one thing on\
  \ his wishlist was a Traxxas RC truck, which cost at least $200 new. I planned on\
  \ buying him one for Christmas but my brother Eric informed me that he\u2019d buy\
  \ one for Ian\u2019s birthday.\n\nAnother important part of this story is the fact\
  \ that despite making 200k+ a year in tech, Eric is incredibly stingy. He has a\
  \ history of giving out tasteless cheap gifts and bragging about how little he spent\
  \ on them. \n\nThe unwrapping of the presents was well underway when Eric drove\
  \ up bearing a large gift wrapped box. Ian unwrapped his gift, saw what it was,\
  \ and freaked out with excitement. I immediately saw that Eric had gotten Ian a\
  \ used RC truck. I asked Eric where he got it and he told me he got it from a guy\
  \ on Craigslist for $75. I was furious to say the least, but I didn\u2019t let my\
  \ emotions show for the sake of Ian\u2019s birthday party.\n\nI\u2019m a bit torn\
  \ right now because on one hand Ian LOVES the truck even though it wasn\u2019t brand\
  \ new. On the other hand, Eric upstaged me and he couldn\u2019t be bothered to change\
  \ his cheap ways just this once."
