selftext: "Can hardly believe this is an issue but here goes,\n\nI work on a small\
  \ team at a medium sized corporation. One of my more senior teammates (not my manager)\
  \ got a intern for the Winter and wanted to take her out to lunch. He invited all\
  \ of us to go with him. When we got to the restaurant I couldn't decide what I wanted\
  \ to eat so I ended up ordering two different entrees so I could try different things.\
  \ Senior teammate asked if I skipped breakfast or something and I laughed it off.\
  \ I figured it would be fine since it's on the corporate card, right? Wrong. Turns\
  \ out management didn't approve the lunch but my teammate thought it was important\
  \ to do anyway as a nice gesture to our intern so he ended up putting down his card.\
  \ The meal came out to $100 between the five of us, with my food totaling $45. \n\
  \nTo top it all off, the food wasn't even that good so I ended up~~ sending both\
  \ entrees back half eaten~~ only eating half of each. I don't think it's my fault\
  \ that the food was bad or even that I was starving, so I can't understand why my\
  \ teammate would be upset at me. He's asked me to limit my eating if we ever go\
  \ out to lunch again, like, come on dude? Hopefully you kind folks can tell me what\
  \ I can say to him to get him to move on. \n\nSo folks, AITA?\n\nEDIT: Everyone's\
  \ saying I'm am asshoke for \"sending the food back\" but I just let the server\
  \ clear the table all right? Hopefully that changes things."
