selftext: "Title says it all, sole provider for family, all credit cards maxed, negative\
  \ bank balance, upcoming missed payments until my next check, basically destitute\
  \ for the foreseeable future.  My wife and I usually decorate on Black Friday, but\
  \ this year I don't want to.  The thought of putting up our fake tree knowing I'll\
  \ have nothing to put under it fills me with such a mix of shame, anger, and pain.\
  \  I would prefer to just let December pass and cut out as many things as I can\
  \ until I can get my finances under control.  Plus, my daughter is 2. She won't\
  \ know, care, or even remember one missed Christmas.  So, AITA?  I'm already a failure\
  \ as a husband and father, so what say you here?\n\nTHIS HAS SPUN OUT OF CONTROL!\
  \  I never thought my sad man pity party would get this kind of response.  I was\
  \ expecting to be called an asshole, validate my self loathing, and claw my way\
  \ out of debt by working harder.  I did not expect the absolute torrent of love\
  \ and support that I in no way deserve or can accept.\n\nINFO (And I am so sorry\
  \ for not making this crystal clear in the original post): Our mortgage and utilities\
  \ are paid.  There is food in our fridge and my next paycheck(s) is secure, even\
  \ though it, too, will all go to bills with none left over for gifts.  I pretended\
  \ not to notice that we weren't keeping up our pre-child lifestyle without credit\
  \ cards and I got in over my head and now have to dig myself out of a relatively\
  \ deep hole meaning I won't have money for gifts and meals out and holiday gatherings\
  \ and whatnot for a good bit of time to come.  But, I have a great job and an outstanding\
  \ family support system who all live close by and know what debt feels like and\
  \ will understand if we can't chip in this year with anything but our presence,\
  \ but it just felt shameful to have the advantages I have and still manage to fuck\
  \ it up as bad as I did without asking for help. \n\nAs for all the people begging\
  \ me to accept help, here is why I can't:  I make a good salary.  There is no chance\
  \ of me or my family going hungry.  We have food and will have money for food budgeted\
  \ into my paychecks, which are secure as my job is secure. I have an extremely well\
  \ funded 401k from 18 years of office work and life insurance to safeguard my family.\
  \  Thank you all who were offering food.  Thank you all who offered to buy my 2\
  \ year old's amazon wish list.  She's 2 and does not have one.  My wife and I had\
  \ already decided that she has too many toys and so we had only things like books\
  \ and a learning tablet in mind for her.  She'll be ok if we can't buy her \"stuff\"\
  .  She already has \"stuff\".  Her close in age cousins live on our street and we\
  \ exchange toys and clothes all the time and both our houses are cluttered with\
  \ \"stuff\".  This was not about garnering pity or soliciting charity.  It was my\
  \ insecurity equating gifts with love that warped Christmas for me.  It almost ruined\
  \ Christmas for me.  Regardless of the vote here, I truly am THE asshole for that.\
  \  So please, turn your charity to your communities, your neighbors.  Not some middle\
  \ class jagoff who spent himself into debt trying to prove how much he loved a family\
  \ that only needed him to be a happy and healthy presence at home.  You all have\
  \ humbled me beyond words, beyond charity.  You have given me both the perspective\
  \ and the courage to seek professional help, both financial and psychological, and\
  \ hopefully it's not too late for this stupid old man to become a better father\
  \ and husband.  Yes Virginia, there is a Santa Claus.  His spirit is truly embodied\
  \ in all of you beautiful and selfless redditors.  Never lose the light.  Love and\
  \ cheer to all.  But as you can see, I deserve neither your charity nor your goodness,\
  \ and I'm going to go disappear back into anonymity now if possible and work on\
  \ me.\n\nUpdate for those concerned:  I have not ever, even for a second, considered\
  \ hurting myself.  Not once.  I'm showing my age here, but Goonies never say die.\n\
  \nUpdate for INFO, and I hope this answers all the questions people had, as there\
  \ were many, and so I'm just going to write a bio that answers them all:  I live\
  \ in the Mid-Atlantic United States.  When we got pregnant (after 6 years of trying\
  \ and failing and treatments and tears) we found out that it would cost us $50 a\
  \ month for my wife to work her current job and put our daughter in full time daycare,\
  \ as day care costs upwards of $1600 a month for even local co-ops, to say nothing\
  \ of the $2100+ that most daycare companies were asking.  The solution was for her\
  \ to \"retire\" and take up the even harder job of full time mother.  I work 8-5\
  \ at a day job and I pick up shifts DJing at a local bar at night and DJ private\
  \ events/weddings/etc... when I can book them.  My daughter was about to turn 2,\
  \ and be able to start 3 day a week \"preschool\" for far less than the cost of\
  \ 5 day a week daycare, meaning my wife could work again, at least part time.  I\
  \ was in the referral process to find a surgeon to do my vasectomy when we found\
  \ out that despite using birth control, my wife was pregnant again. We're due in\
  \ February, a little boy this time.  Utter shock, disbelief, some truly unhealthy\
  \ thoughts, and finally acceptance that I was going to have to continue to be the\
  \ full time provider, as there was no way we could put 2 kids in full time care,\
  \ so once again, my sainted wife will have to spend at least another 2 years as\
  \ a full time mom.  My wife and I are old people(42M, 40F) who tried to have kids\
  \ earlier in life, but couldn't despite multiple treatments, and only succeeded\
  \ when we stopped trying so hard and resigned ourselves to the thoughts of a comfortable\
  \ dual income no kids lifestyle full of travel and memories, Bringing one life into\
  \ this world at 40 after everything we went through was a laugh, only for life to\
  \ turn around and \"bless\" me with a second child.  My wife is overjoyed, and I\
  \ am happy but terrified of how I will afford this.  She applied for part time seasonal\
  \ work to help with our bills, but the job she was hired for has given her exactly\
  \ 2 shifts in 2 weeks, and taken one of those shifts away at the last minute due\
  \ to overstaffing.  She has a meeting with them today to find out if it's worth\
  \ her time to stay employed there, dependent on if they can actually give her at\
  \ the least 20 hours a week which she requested upon applying.  We have had joint\
  \ finances since we were engaged.  We don't hide things from each other, we're both\
  \ well aware of our money issues and have been working on ways to improve our financial\
  \ situation. (Thank you all for the links and sites, I am bookmarking them all!).\
  \  We have and will keep communication open.  It was our promise made to each other\
  \ 13 years ago to never shoulder our burdens alone.\n\nLastly (hopefully, I know\
  \ this is long) I am humbled by your offers of charity, dear strangers.  Truly and\
  \ deeply humbled.  I cannot accept them, be it out of foolish pride or some other\
  \ moral driver, but know that your kind words and even kinder offers have softened\
  \ my resolve to cancel Christmas this year.  I just spent 2 days with co-workers\
  \ volunteering at 2 local food banks preparing meals, clothes, and groceries for\
  \ the community, so if you're one of the many wonderful strangers who offered help,\
  \ please give that help to your local charity.  I have a roof over my head, and\
  \ food in my belly, and I could not ask for more, not when I have so much already.\
  \  \n\nI still dread the thought of lugging that old fake tree out of the laundry\
  \ room, but my feelings have to come 3rd, here and always.  My wife and daughter\
  \ need the love and joy that that old tree will bring, and I need to give them everything\
  \ I can, even if it's the just the spirit of the season. They deserve to feel the\
  \ warmth of a festive home, and we already own the damn thing, so it's literally\
  \ the least I can do.  My presents will be the 1 million pictures my wife will take\
  \ of our daughter pulling all the ornaments she can reach off the tree and showing\
  \ them to her with that beautiful smile she has.  Our families are close by, and\
  \ our parents will no doubt do their best to spoil our daughter and I know it will\
  \ be more than enough.\n\n\nUPDATE!  Wife and I downloaded a budget app and are\
  \ working with a family member who does financial planning. I, personally, spoke\
  \ with someone (a professional) early this morning and in just the initial phone\
  \ call she helped me realize that I was equating being able to give gifts with showing\
  \ love to my family.  Not being able to afford baubles isn't going to mean I love\
  \ them less, and I will need to accept that and I will continue to work with her\
  \ as long as my insurance will allow.  Thanks to close friends with growing kids,\
  \ we have an embarrassment of clothes and toys to sort through, and wrapping some\
  \ of these items for my little girl to tear into is more than good enough for my\
  \ wife and I.  My wife and I have plenty of clothes  Thank you to all who have offered\
  \ to purchase things for us.  My heart bursts from the selfless and wonderful offers.\
  \  But, I meant what I said when I asked you to please point your humongous hearts\
  \ to your local charities. I have more than enough \"things\" and taking things\
  \ from strangers to compensate for my poor spending habits feels wrong.  It will\
  \ be a tough few months, but I have a good job with opportunities to grow and am\
  \ going to work with professionals to learn some much needed budget control, and\
  \ work with a therapist to learn to accept help from family and friends when the\
  \ new baby arrives and to be less hard on myself.  I am also going to spend more\
  \ time with my local food bank, I signed up to help build meal kits this week to\
  \ be distributed for Christmas in my community.  I'm planning on \"giving\" generously\
  \ this season, just not in the consumerist sense.  I think that's a \"new tradition\"\
  \ that my family can and will preserve for years to come.  Even y'all who called\
  \ me a stupid cunt.  Thank you, too, for keeping me grounded.\n\nTo those of you\
  \ who have asked how could I have tried for 6 years to have a kid and \"not bothered\
  \ to budget for it once it came\" are greatly underestimating how much fertility\
  \ treatments cost even with insurance, and how well and truly fucked American Healthcare\
  \ really is.  We are taking steps to ensure that this kid will be our last, and\
  \ I actually brought up abortion but my wife would not even consider it.  Thankful\
  \ for that now."
