selftext: "While my friends and I were on vacation, we were just talking about life.\
  \ Soon, we talked about our sex lives. \n \nLet's call this girl Amanda. Amanda\
  \ admitted that she was a sugar baby, and would have sex with multiple men for money.\
  \ She said that word for word. The atmosphere got extremely awkward, and then I\
  \ decided to make it more awkward. \"So, you're a prostitute?\" A couple people\
  \ laughed and chuckled. She replied back with \"I'm a sugar baby, not a prostitute.\
  \ Huge difference\". I asked what the difference was, and she then stammered a bit\
  \ and said fuck you. \n \nI honestly didn't think she would be offended. My friend\
  \ group is divided half and half with them siding with me or not. \n \nSo, AITA?\n\
  \ \nEdit: I am a girl, not sure if that changes anything. Also, I did not mean to\
  \ make things more awkward on purpose."
