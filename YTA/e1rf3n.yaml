selftext: 'My ex and I were vegan. I became vegan when we moved in together because
  he was vegan and he didn''t like there being animal products in the house. I learned
  more about the way food was made and I agreed. I was vegan while I was pregnant
  and we''ve raised our daughter vegan for the past eight-ish years.


  We divorced 15 months ago. He was not faithful but while he was a terrible partner
  to me, he loves his daughter and during this time I''ve tried to be a good coparent.


  Yesterday I picked up my daughter from her dad''s house - he wanted to keep her
  late because he and his partner were going to take the kids (she has 3) to a matinee
  of Frozen. So it''s dinner time when I''m getting her.


  As we''re driving home she says she''s hungry. I offered her my purse apple (I should
  have packed better car snacks for the ride) but she spies the golden arches out
  the window. She has a full. blown. meltdown demanding chicken nuggets.


  We get home and she''s, like, blowing snot bubbles she''s so enraged. She howls
  her way through a bowl of leftover soup (honestly, I think I was just being an asshole
  at this point because we have chick''n nuggets in the freezer I could have made
  but rewarding that kind of tantrum seemed like bad parenting). She hates me, I''m
  a terrible mom, Dad would have let her eat chicken nuggets. She wore herself out
  crying.


  She was upset when she woke up this morning asking if I ''hated'' her because she
  ate meat (OBVIOUSLY, obviously, obviously not). I spent the entire drive to school
  reassuring her that I''m not angry with her but that I was surprised that she wanted
  them. I also reiterated I wasn''t happy with her behaviour of screaming and hollering
  when she didn''t get what she wanted. I understand that sometimes our emotions feel
  big but we have to try and be in control of them and not the other way around.


  But I AM fucking pissed because I wasn''t aware our hitherto vegan daughter was
  now eating meat and I feel like that''s a decision that I should have been informed
  about. I called him after she went to bed and he told me I was being uptight and
  he didn''t tell me because he knew I''d overreact. I''m controlling and I don''t
  need to be privy to every single thing he does when our daughter is with him.


  I''m fucking MAD. There are vegan options at McDonalds - he didn''t have to feed
  her chicken but since he did, I would have appreciated a heads-up. Also, for a dude
  who gave me a hard time for craving oreos (which are fucking vegan) while pregnant
  with her, kinda annoyed that he''s shovelling crap in her mouth hand over fist taking
  her to McDonalds every week.


  I''d always felt like when she became old enough to choose her diet, I''d let her
  make her own decisions. If she wants to each chicken nuggets, give''r. But, like,
  I feel wildly, wildly frustrated that he unilaterally made this choice. I feel like
  I should have been made aware. I try to keep him updated on her stuff when she''s
  with me. AITA?'
