selftext: 'My wife and I have been planning a two week family vacation to Europe,
  where most of my wife''s extended family and friends live, for a long time now,
  and we have our trip booked for Dec. 7 through Dec. 22. This is supposed to be both
  our first big vacation as a family and the first time her relatives would get to
  meet our 3 year old daughter.


  For some additional background, I am currently the sole breadwinner for our family,
  and my wife is a stay at home mom and cares for our daughter full time. I work for
  a small firm that consists of five people: my boss plus four employees he manages,
  including me. One of my coworkers is currently out on FMLA leave for medical issues
  and is tentatively scheduled to return in January if her recovery goes well.


  In the past week, everything has basically gone to shit at the office. My two other
  coworkers just both put in their two weeks notice within days of each other, and
  we have a huge project due by the end of the year. The timing couldn''t possibly
  be worse. My boss is extremely stressed out and asked if I would consider postponing
  my vacation. He said he would normally never ask this of me, but this was an uniquely
  crappy situation and he can''t handle the project alone. He offered to reimburse
  me for all nonrefundable costs of the trip.


  Obviously I''m not happy about this. My wife is really mad and says this is a ridiculous
  request for my boss to make and that I need to put our family first and go on the
  vacation anyway. We had planned our trip around the availability of all the friends/family
  we wanted to visit, and it will be a pain in the ass to find another set of dates
  that works for everyone. I think having to cancel the trip is shitty, but I''m worried
  I''ll be out of a job if I say no, and we only have a few months of emergency savings
  to live off of if that happens. As much as I hate it, I really think it would be
  in our family''s best interest to cancel. WITBA?'
