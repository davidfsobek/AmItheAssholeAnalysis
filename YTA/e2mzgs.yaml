selftext: "I have two children. They are both twins. James and Becky. \n \nThey are\
  \ both currently Freshmen in college. Becky is instate, but far enough so that she\
  \ doesn\u2019t live with us. James does call me every week for just a heads up on\
  \ what\u2019s happening. I think our relationship is pretty good. Becky on the other\
  \ hand... She blocked me on all social media about a month ago. She blocked my number,\
  \ and I can only communicate with her indirectly. I really don\u2019t know what\
  \ happened. \n \nShe\u2019s not even coming to Thanksgiving nor Christmas. I mean,\
  \ I understand that kids want some distance from their parents, but I feel like\
  \ this is too much. James is coming for the holidays, though just for two days.\
  \ Her not coming for the holidays is perfectly fine. I still love Becky, but I really\
  \ think this is unfair. She could get mad at me, but she has to express her feelings\
  \ in a mature way, not like this. \n \nSo, I\u2019m thinking of stopping all funds\
  \ to her now. I\u2019m not paying for either of their entire tuition. I agreed to\
  \ pay half of each. But now, I think I should pay for most of James\u2019 tuition\
  \ instead of paying half and half. I know that might seem unfair, but I have emotions\
  \ too.\n \nI know Reddit is full of young people, so I\u2019m probably an asshole.\
  \ But that\u2019s why I came here. Y\u2019all probably have some insight.\n \nSo,\
  \ AITA?\n \nShe probably blocked me because I did start dating"
