selftext: 'I have 4 kids. Oldest two are teens and youngest are almost 10. I work
  12 hour shifts at night and get off in the morning right before they have to go
  to school. I usually sleep while they''re at school and get up when they get home
  and then start my day.


  Except today. They are off for the holidays but I am not. When I got home, I sat
  two boxes of cereal on the kitchen table and told them to make breakfast and be
  quiet until at least 1. They were loud af. I took away electronics and told them
  they were acting like brats because they couldn''t be quiet for just 5 hours so
  that I could sleep.


  Their other parent is now calling me an a****** for neglecting my children and not
  feeding them properly and expecting kids to be quiet. I didn''t see it as such a
  crazy request. I did apologize for calling them brats but I didn''t give their electronics
  back because children that age, in my opinion, should be able to be quiet for 5
  hours so that I can sleep. We''re not just talking about regular kid noises, they
  were playing tag... In the house. AITA?'
