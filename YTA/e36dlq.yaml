selftext: "We were in a large city that we were unfamiliar with, and we spontaneously\
  \ decided we were hungry. Not knowing where to go, we decided to stop in a restaurant.\
  \ However, before going in I told her that we needed to check the menu first. She\
  \ agreed. Once we got inside the hostess asked \u201Chow many?\u201D And before\
  \ I could even answer my wife said \u201C2\u201D and the hostess was already halfway\
  \ to the table to seat us. \n\nMy wife sat down, pretending like she forgot about\
  \ checking the menu first and she still said nothing and agreed when the hostess\
  \ said she\u2019d bring us waters. As soon as the hostess walked away I (still standing)\
  \ shrugged and said \u201Cseriously? I thought we were going to check the menu\u201D\
  . She said \u201Coh it looks fine, sit down, I\u2019m hungry\u201D. I was in actual\
  \ disbelief and I checked the menu and did not like it. \n\nMy wife refused to leave\
  \ and I said \u201Cokay, enjoy your lunch\u201D and I left. She texted and called\
  \ me and I didn\u2019t answer. Only told her \u201CI will be at xyz\u201D and gave\
  \ her the address. \n\nOnce she finished she met up with me, visibly upset that\
  \ I left her in the restaurant. She said I embarrassed her. I told her she dishonored\
  \ our agreement and since we didn\u2019t order drinks or food she could have easily\
  \ followed me, but decided to be stubborn. She acted distant the rest of the trip\
  \ but I refused to apologize. Who was wrong?"
