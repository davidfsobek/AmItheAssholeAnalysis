selftext: "Edit #2 :\n\nTo answer some questions, she only accepts cash (with no option\
  \ to use an app/venmo etc) which has worked for us for about a year and this payment\
  \ would be for next week, services not performed yet. She is paid completely in\
  \ full for her work performed. I don't have family in the area. \n\n_________________________________________\n\
  \nMy entire household has the flu and I\u2019m the mom of the household. Noses and\
  \ shit needs wiping, medicine needs giving etc etc. it\u2019s thanksgiving but we\
  \ are all dying in beds. \n\nI wake up from much needed rest to a text from our\
  \ sitter asking \u201Cwhat\u2019s the plan for tuition?\u201D \n\nNormally it\u2019\
  s due Fridays but due to the holiday she wanted to know if someone is bringing it.\
  \ \n\nI tell her \u201Cwe all have the flu, can I bring it Monday?\u201D \n\nWhich\
  \ she knows bc we picked our daughter up early on Monday bc she was \u201Ccranky\u201D\
  \ and told her on Monday she tested positive for it and we all did. So she\u2019\
  s also getting a full week of pay for only 5 hours of childcare.... \n\nAnyways...\
  \ She says \u201Csure, with no late fee for Monday,\u201D but then proceeds to tell\
  \ me she hates reminding parents about tuition in a long long text. \n\nFor some\
  \ reason it rubbed me the wrong way and I replied \u201Csometimes parents need reminders\
  \ especially when everyone is sick\u201D \n\nShe replied \u201CI keep a calendar\
  \ on my fridge so people don\u2019t have to remind me to work and seems like you\u2019\
  re fine if you can text.\u201D\n\nIdk if it\u2019s because I\u2019m sick but I was\
  \ just like \u201CI\u2019ll find another childcare provider.\u201D \n\nWe\u2019\
  ve used her for almost a year and it just seems silly she\u2019s not more considerate\
  \ that we are contagious and stuck in the house not by choice. \n\nI\u2019m sad\
  \ now because my daughter loves her but am I the asshole for feeling disrespected?\
  \ Is this the fever/sickness talking?\n\nTLDR; AITA for letting my sitter go because\
  \ she only seemed to care about $$ while we are all at home dying of the flu?\n\n\
  \nEdit \u2014- got it, I am the asshole. Will revisit the conversation via phone\
  \ when we are better and I\u2019m not miserable and making other miserable with\
  \ me. Thanks for the feedback."
