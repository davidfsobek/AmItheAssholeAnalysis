selftext: "My ex wife Jane and I have a 9 year old called Lucy. She lives with Jane\
  \ but I have regular contact. She's lovely, a very loud, springy and energetic girl.\
  \ She's currently going through her ''pretending to be a teenager'' phase and is\
  \ obsessed with dressing/acting like an older girl. She also tries to imitate teenage\
  \ slang ''innit blud''. She's very bright too. In her school assessments she came\
  \ top of her year in all three main subjects (English, Maths and Science) and got\
  \ 100% (not a single mistake) in all three. She's got lots of friends and had her\
  \ birthday party last week which was absolutely packed. \n\nMy partner Kirsty and\
  \ I have a daughter too. Her name is Tina and she's six. She's a highly sensitive\
  \ child and cries very frequently. She can get emotionally overwhelmed at any time\
  \ and burst into tears. She frightens very easily and is scared of almost everything\
  \ (heights and the dark are the worst). She's very smart in school just like her\
  \ sister but doesn't have many friends because she's often scared to play with other\
  \ children. Tina sleeps with a night light and sometimes sleeps in our room if she\
  \ gets too frightened. Her therapist has recommended all of this. \n\nToday Lucy\
  \ was to spend the night here. It was bedtime and Lucy thought it would be funny\
  \ to play creepy sounds and voices into Tina's bedroom. We didn't know until Tina\
  \ ran into our room screaming. Lucy followed her laughing. It took a long time to\
  \ calm Tina down. She was whimpering and hyperventilating and wanted to spend the\
  \ night in our room. \n\nTina was my main worry at the moment, and I phoned Jane\
  \ asking if she could come and pick Lucy up. Lucy started crying and saying it was\
  \ just a joke. I didn't do it to punish her but because at that moment we needed\
  \ to focus on calming Tina down. \n\nWhen Jane picked her up Lucy was crying her\
  \ eyes out, saying she hates me and doesn't want to come back here. All I could\
  \ say was that I loved her. Jane wasn't happy either, accusing me of everything\
  \ from favouritism to babying Tina and saying I didn't deserve Lucy. \n\nTina has\
  \ finally gone to bed in the little cushion bed we made for her. I'm writing this\
  \ because it was so heartbreaking seeing Lucy like that. She genuinely thought I\
  \ was kicking her out. I don't know when I'll see her next but I feel like I've\
  \ let her down as her dad.\n\nedit: Can I just make the point here that I didn't\
  \ send Lucy away because I felt that Tina was more important or whatever. Up until\
  \ I said I was calling her mum Lucy showed no remorse whatsoever. She insisted it\
  \ was just a joke and that Tina couldn't take a joke, even though she knows how\
  \ sensitive her sister is. I explained multiple times but she refused to admit she\
  \ was wrong until I picked up the phone, and even then it wasn't to punish her,\
  \ it was because Tina was in an awful state and didn't want Lucy near her because\
  \ of how frightened she was."

  to stay here?
