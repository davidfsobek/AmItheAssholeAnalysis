selftext: "So every year for thanksgiving my entire mom\u2019s side of the family\
  \ gets together (grandparents, all their kids/their spouses, my cousins/spouses,\
  \ and my cousins children). In all there are 25 people that get together. And every\
  \ year we do the typical go around the table and say what you\u2019re thankful for\
  \ that\u2019s happened in the last year. We hold hands, grandpa starts, when the\
  \ person is done saying what they want they squeeze their right hand and that person\
  \ starts. We have done this ever since I remember and I really don\u2019t remember\
  \ anyone ever skipping a turn but I can\u2019t be sure. \n\nThis year has also been\
  \ a pretty bad year for my husband and I, not that everything has been bad but the\
  \ bad things have far outweighed the good and I wasn\u2019t really feeling in the\
  \ festive mood. We found out we are infertile in January, did IVF, got pregnant\
  \ and had a miscarriage... and well yeah, the holidays suck especially since I was\
  \ due to give birth right after they were over but that\u2019s obviously not happening\
  \ now. We considered staying home and not going because it was a hard day but my\
  \ family really wanted to see us and so we went. \n\nI told my grandma that I was\
  \ going to skip myself during the tradition because of my mood and she kind of just\
  \ brushed me off, she was busy cooking so she might have just not heard me, but\
  \ I thought she did. So we are going around the table and it gets to me, I just\
  \ squeeze my right hand and my husband starts talking. Grandpa pipes up and says\
  \ \u201C[me] has to say something.\u201D And I said \u201Cno, I\u2019m not feeling\
  \ particularly thankful or in a festive mood this year, so I thought it would be\
  \ best to skip my turn.\u201D Grandma then says \u201CYou have to say something,\
  \ you can\u2019t skip. We all have something to be thankful for.\u201D And my response\
  \ was (probably where I become TA) \u201Cwhich should I be more thankful for: my\
  \ dead children or the possibility of not having more?\u201D I didn\u2019t wait\
  \ for a response and got up and left. My husband followed and we just left, didn\u2019\
  t eat dinner or say goodbye. \n\nWhen I turned my phone on this morning I got a\
  \ bunch of different texts from family members. My immediate family and my aunt\
  \ understand that I said what I said because I was hurting and didn\u2019t want\
  \ to do it. My mom thinks I might have gone to far with what I said but still understands.\
  \ Everyone else is rather upset with me for it. So AITA?"
