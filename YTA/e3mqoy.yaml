selftext: "I\u2019ve been in a long term relationship for 7 years. My girlfriend doesn\u2019\
  t believe in marriage and has turned down the notion of me ever asking her, but\
  \ for all intents and purposes we both plan on spending our lives with one another.\n\
  \nGf is due to give birth in January 2020. I\u2019m obviously over the moon excited,\
  \ and can\u2019t wait. First baby for both of us. \n\nNow, I\u2019m sure I\u2019\
  m going to be laughed at on Reddit here, but I\u2019m an incredibly squeamish guy.\
  \ I believe this stems from when I was a kid, I threw up at camp and there was blood\
  \ in it and some bullies rubbed my face in it holding me down in my own sick. \n\
  \nSince then the smell or sight of blood makes me dead faint. I get sick, I get\
  \ this weird numbness in my ass, I just for whatever reason can\u2019t handle it.\
  \ I literally pass out if I\u2019m around blood. Many years of therapy later, I\u2019\
  ve just accepted blood is a no go for me. Even if I myself bleed, I have to look\
  \ away from that shit straight away or I\u2019ll end up throwing up. \n\nI\u2019\
  m ok handling it on tv etc but when I see it IRL I can smell it and taste it in\
  \ my mouth and that\u2019s where things get weird for me.  \n\nSo I explained to\
  \ my gf that I\u2019m with her for literally every step of the way but I don\u2019\
  t think I can be in the delivery room. Because she knows about the blood thing,\
  \ I explained to her that that was my reasoning and that obviously I didn\u2019\
  t want to stress her out even more by throwing up or passing out, I especially don\u2019\
  t need medical attention on me during a time when all the attention needs to be\
  \ on her. \n\nShe became very defensive and said that I\u2019m being an asshole\
  \ for not even trying to enter the delivery room, and that I\u2019m being selfish.\
  \ I said that I know if I try and go in I\u2019ll end up feeling unwell and that\
  \ it\u2019s better to just work around my limitations instead of me trying to be\
  \ in there and then needing to be escorted out.\n\nI spoke to my Gf\u2019s mom because\
  \ they\u2019re best friends and she told me that I was basically not a man if I\
  \ couldn\u2019t handle going in there, so I\u2019m feeling pretty upset and concerned\
  \ over this because it\u2019s not just me feeling light headed, it\u2019s me actually\
  \ blacking out \n\n~~AITA because I don\u2019t want to compromise on this?~~\n\n\
  UPDATE: My girlfriend decided to read through these responses just out of curiosity.\
  \ She\u2019s changed her mind and told me it\u2019s okay if I don\u2019t want to\
  \ be there, and also told me she loves me and we are completely cool. She also apologized\
  \ on behalf of her mom since she wasn\u2019t aware about her telling me to man up\
  \ , which although was unnecessary was also completely appreciated. I\u2019m the\
  \ luckiest guy in the world and I\u2019m v grateful that she changed her mind. I\
  \ told her I\u2019m gonna try and stick it through anyway but just knowing I have\
  \ her blessing to wait outside is a great relief. Thanks for the ones who wished\
  \ us well also. Y\u2019all classy.\n\nUPDATE II: some people are wondering how I\
  \ plan on being a good parent if I pass out at blood. Others are demanding that\
  \ I go to therapy. I\u2019d like to point out that *I am still in therapy* for this\
  \ issue (and have been for years) and my doctor feels that once I have my own child\
  \ I will hopefully be able to deal with it without too much trouble. Apparently\
  \ it\u2019s exceedingly common and I\u2019ve spoken to more than one qualified person\
  \ who\u2019ve told me a simplified version of \u2018once your kid actually gets\
  \ here it\u2019s a different ballgame\u2019. If anyone who has some knowledge of\
  \ this wants to weigh in and explain better than me I\u2019d be grateful. \n\nI\u2019\
  m getting a few pm\u2019s that are becoming hostile so all I can tell ya is that\
  \ I plan on being the best father possible and I\u2019m gonna try my hardest *not\
  \ to faint* if my kid ever skins a knee or gets a bleed."
