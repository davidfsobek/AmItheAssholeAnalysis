selftext: "I do a lot of shopping my with my young kids and sometimes when we are\
  \ shopping we get hungry or thirsty. I will let them sip on a soda or eat some food,\
  \ that doesn\u2019t need to be weighed, before getting to the register. I used to\
  \ do this as a kid with my parents and I have never had issues with my own kids.\
  \ We always pay before we leave and I make sure I clean any mess we made. But today\
  \ my husband got extremely upset with this, saying that we are stealing from the\
  \ store and being disrespectful. He and I have both worked in retail before, so\
  \ the fact that our opinions on this are so far apart surprises me. I stood my ground\
  \ and caused a huge argument. Am I being an Asshole customer by not paying before\
  \ I open it?\n\nEdit: For those of you saying I should bring a snack: I think it\
  \ looks like theft even more when my kid or myself eat something I brought and I\
  \ stuff the wrapper in my purse or garbage. They don\u2019t know I brought it from\
  \ home.\n\nSecond Edit: I do not always do this. Sometimes when I\u2019m running\
  \ errands with kids we get hungry or thirsty. Instead of stopping at a restaurant,\
  \ I buy something at the store. It saves me a stop. If they want something they\
  \ ask, I don\u2019t always say yes and they usually respect that (they are kids\
  \ after all).\n\nAlso, for people upset that my child had soda: this particular\
  \ example is of an 11 year old. Soda is not an issue at that age and I won\u2019\
  t change my mind about that. It\u2019s not an every day thing, and everyone deserves\
  \ treats sometimes."
