selftext: "I (20M) am Caucasian and have a Korean friend (20F). When I met her two\
  \ years ago, she looked like your typical pretty Korean girl. In the last few months,\
  \ she made some drastic changes to her appearance. She has been sporting dyed blonde\
  \ hair. Her eyebrows seem more arched than before. She also got a boob job and has\
  \ been wearing yoga pants much more often. \n\n\nWhen I ran into her a few days\
  \ ago, we chatted for a while. I joked that she\u2019s turning Caucasian. I thought\
  \ she would laugh, but she got really defensive. She said that minorities dying\
  \ their hair blonde doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re trying to be Caucasian. She ranted\
  \ for a hot minute, but I didn\u2019t quite catch her reasons. I said she looked\
  \ great and I got to head to class so I\u2019ll see her later."
