selftext: "I\u2019m 22, and I have this friend, Stacy. \nStacy is also 22. She has\
  \ FOUR children under five, and guess what? \nShe\u2019s pregnant again. \nShe started\
  \ having kids when she was 16 and has pretty much had one every year. Her husband\
  \ ( who she married after baby number two) works like 65 hours a week, and they\
  \ are still on public assistance.\n\nShe sent out a group text announcing her 5th\
  \ pregnancy, with the ultra sound and everything.\n I thought it would be funny\
  \ to reply by sending an instructional video on proper condom usage, since she apparently\
  \ doesn\u2019t know what they are.\n We are ok friends so I thought that she would\
  \ think it was funny. Boy was I wrong. She went on a big Twitter rant about people\
  \ being unsupportive of her decisions, and called me out by name. \nThis led to\
  \ a big blow out. It was a joke though, and while I was judging her a little, I\
  \ wasn\u2019t really trying to hurt her feelings. AITA?"
