  think we are.


  Our daughter is in college right now and in her second year. My husband and I are
  paying for a portion of it and give her a monthly allowance of $1000 to help out
  because her school is out of state. So far it''s been roughly 50% on us and 50%
  she needs to get grants or bursaries or loans for. She is choosing not to work right
  now and instead relying on the $1000 we send (her rent is around $200 for her room
  and the $800 remaining is up to her how to use).


  We want to cut her off not because there was some incident but because she''s basically
  ghosted us. Nothing really prompted this. My last conversation with her was very
  cordial standard fare back in early September. Likewise for my husband. We used
  to talk a lot, text every day, etc.


  We send her a Facebook message and get a read receipt but no response. No thank
  you for the money we send monthly, no happy Thanksgiving (or birthday, mine was
  in October), nothing. At the very least we''d like to know she''s okay, and we''ve
  expressed as much, but the outcome is always the same: left on read.


  We have one of her best friends on Facebook and we asked her what''s up and she
  said she''s doing fine, just busy with school. And that''s fine, but not even a
  single message in 3 months?


  I sent her a message two days ago that we feel taken advantage of and that our contribution
  to her schooling is unappreciated. We told her that next tuition payment is due
  end of December and we want to hear from her before we pay it. Read within seconds
  but no response.


  I don''t know what to make of this. Are we being the assholes? Just a check in every
  once in a while is enough, we just have no idea what''s going on.'
