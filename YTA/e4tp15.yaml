selftext: "I (31F) have been into fitness for the better half of my life. I love it\
  \ when others are leading a healthy lifestyle too. My cousin (19F) is a little on\
  \ the heavy side and has never been a sporty girl. I asked her parents last year\
  \ if she went to the gym, and they said she didn\u2019t. Thus, I bought her a two-year\
  \ 24 Hour Fitness membership from Costco for $700 for her 19th birthday. Since it\
  \ was an expensive gift that lasts two years, I joked that I won\u2019t be getting\
  \ her a present for her 20th birthday. \n\n\nI don\u2019t see her often, maybe a\
  \ little less than once a month. I would offer to be her workout buddy, but I don\u2019\
  t live near her. Every time I see her, I ask her if she has been going to the gym.\
  \ She always says yes and briefly describes her routine. I give her some pointers\
  \ about fitness and nutrition. It\u2019s been over half a year now, but I\u2019\
  m not seeing any improvement in her body. If anything, it seems like she has packed\
  \ on more weight in less desirable areas. \n\n\nI asked her today if she has been\
  \ going to the gym and she sternly said yes and to stop asking her this question\
  \ over and over. I apologized, and trying my best not to shame her for her lack\
  \ of progress, I reiterated some pointers again about fitness and nutrition. She\
  \ told me quite loudly to stop talking to her about these things again since it\u2019\
  s annoying. Again, I apologized and changed the topic."
title: AITA for asking my cousin if she has been going to the gym every time I see
  her?
