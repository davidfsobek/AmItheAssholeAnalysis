selftext: "EDITS AT THE BOTTOM\n\nSo I (30M) work in science and I do realize the\
  \ many of my friends and contacts belong in the same bubble I'm in. However, I also\
  \ am friends with people who do not have anything to do with science or academia,\
  \ and I think they have valuable skillsets that are different than mine.\n\nMy cousin\
  \ (31M) studied political science at the university, but slowly started to verge\
  \ his carreer after being dissatisfied with the jobs he worked. He started teaching\
  \ himself calculus, programming and statistics, also enrolling in official university\
  \ online courses, at last he managed to land a job as a data scientist.\n\nAnyway,\
  \ I was out with him and a friend of mine and we started discussing about education\
  \ and so on (my cousin's boyfriend is a teacher in high school). Somehow the topic\
  \ came out of liquids and weight and measures and so on and, almost as a joke, I\
  \ asked my cousin how many grams would 10ml of water weight. He couldn't answer,\
  \ but he was in and thinking about it, so I started giving hints such as \"think\
  \ about how much water there is in a glass\", or \"how much does a liter weight\"\
  , \"how many milliliters are there in a liter\" etc... \nLong story short, at some\
  \ point among these hints I said \"come on, how big is a 1l cube (we use metric)?\"\
  \ And he couldn't tell me. At this point, though, I reacted with a flabbergasted\
  \ face and was honestly incredolous that he didn't know this.\n\nHe then started\
  \ being upset at first, since he thought I was mocking him. He became even more\
  \ upset when I mentioned that I though this was basic knowledge that people get\
  \ thought in elementary school, and repeated until high school. He then said I am\
  \ an elitist and that I shouldn't shit on people because I'm in a bubble, and that\
  \ there are many things that he somehow takes for granted that I don't know. \n\
  I said I believed this, and I honestly do, but that I didn't think I lack such basic\
  \ knowledge in any \"basic\" area of life. I then started listing many \"basic\"\
  \ knowledges that I think are indispensable for an adult, with none of them being\
  \ \"scientific\" knowledge (i.e.: how money works, basic healthcare , knowing one\
  \ foreign language, using a computer, how to drive a screw with a screwdriver and\
  \ so on...).\nHe proceeded to call me an elitist asshole again, that I was gatekeeping,\
  \ and started listing many things he studied and that I obviously didn't know. I\
  \ would like to point out, though, that the examples he made were coming from topics\
  \ he studied at university and not tought in school to first graders.\n\nI apologized\
  \ at the moment, because I didn't want to make him upset again, but honestly I do\
  \ think and mean the things I said.\n\nSo reddit, AITA for believing EVERYBODY should\
  \ have basic ground knowledge of several topics, that school teaches things to young\
  \ children for a reason, and that if you forget these or never learn them then you\
  \ are to blame if this surprises people?\n\nEDITS: I read the comments and I understand\
  \ I was at wrong. Thanks for the reality check, I guess I needed it. Btw, not american\
  \ and we use the metric sistem in our daily lives."
