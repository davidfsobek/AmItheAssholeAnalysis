selftext: "I'm the eldest (Male 29) of my siblings and as most people can probably\
  \ relate to, also the forgotten. While my younger sister(20)\nWas my mother's favorite\
  \ since birth. She was also the one to get better grades, popular in school, participated\
  \ in tons of school activities, and pretty much outshines the rest of us.\n\nMe\
  \ and my wife got married on April 24th 2019, a small event, no too big because\
  \ millenial pocket change and broke parents and in-laws.\n\nMy sister's now fiance\
  \ was accepted day one of dating as family, my fiance was given a $20 kids lipstick\
  \ set for christmas while this dude recieved $200 worth of Christmas from my mother\
  \ the same year. My fiance that I had been with for five years wasn't allowed at\
  \ my grandmothers funeral in the family section to console me, but her boyfriend\
  \ of two months was?\n\nFirst born eldest with a smaller wedding versus favorite\
  \ child's big blown out wedding 6 days before our anniversary, feels like the one\
  \ thing that my mother would remember about me will become overshadowed by her favorite\
  \ and forgotten and dismissed like everything else.\n\nTL;DR  Am I the asshole for\
  \ wanting my mother's favorite sibling that outshines me and my wife in everyway\
  \ to move her extravagant wedding so that so that we actually have something that\
  \ makes us feel special and excited?\n\nEdit: just to show how little my mother\
  \ thinks of us, she wore a tie dye shirt and worn out jeans to my wedding.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/xsvuI6R\n\
  \nEdit 2: Just for more info I asked her why that day,        \n\"We just like that\
  \ it's all even number.\""
