selftext: My daughter is in 5th grade and it's her birthday next weekend. She wants
  to have a slumber party with all of the girls in her class (about like 10 of them).
  The problem is that there is a trans (MtF) student, Johnny.  My daughter had not
  invited him to the party as she did not want a "boy to be sleepover her house".
  Johnny evidently feels very upset that he's been left out and told his parents.
  His mom called me and asked me to let him come over to the party and that she wouldn't
  even be upset if he didn't sleep over. I told her something to the tune of that
  it's my daughter's party and that him being there would upset so no. Reddit aita?
