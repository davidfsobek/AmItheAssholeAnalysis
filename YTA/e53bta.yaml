selftext: "I live in an apartment with my husband and kids, and we own an adorable\
  \ German Shepherd. Recently it was announced they have a new policy - all dogs in\
  \ the complex have to be DNA tested to help identify people who don\u2019t clean\
  \ up their dogs\u2019 poop. They have some DNA testing system where they send in\
  \ the poop and have it matched up with all the dogs in the complex, and then hit\
  \ the owner of the offending dog with a hefty fee.\n\nI\u2019m fine with this, as\
  \ there are some people (not me) in our complex who let their dogs crap freely and\
  \ don\u2019t pick it up. What I *wasn\u2019t* okay with, though, was that our apartment\
  \ charged all dog owners a $30 fee to have the DNA tested.\_\n\nWhen we got our\
  \ last statement from the apartment, I noticed the $30 fee added on and was pissed.\
  \ We already pay damn good money to live in this complex, and I don\u2019t appreciate\
  \ them tacking on extra bullshit fees. Particularly when my dog isn\u2019t one of\
  \ the offenders. I\u2019m being made to pay for other peoples\u2019 \u201Cshit\u201D\
  , literally.\n\nOver the past couple weeks, I have endlessly complained, sulked\
  \ and moaned to management and apartment staff like you could not imagine about\
  \ the fee. It\u2019s gotten to the point that employees pretty much clear the lobby\
  \ every time I come in, figuring \u201COh shit, she\u2019s here!\u201D I made a\
  \ post on Facebook venting about it, that many people who live in our complex saw.\
  \ I\u2019ve sent numerous emails, vented verbally, posted, etc...and yesterday,\
  \ it paid off. Yesterday we got a notification from our apartment manager telling\
  \ us he\u2019ll waive the $30 fee for us.\n\nI\u2019m pretty happy and feel that\
  \ my persistence really paid off. AITA for not wanting to pay this fee?"
