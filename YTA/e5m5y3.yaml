selftext: "So, some background. I work in a sales office near where I live with my\
  \ GF (who works as a teacher). If you live in the Northeast of the US, you know\
  \ we got a lot of snow last night. So my girlfriend had the day off, but I didn't.\
  \ Around 11 she started texting me asking how many people were in my office. I told\
  \ her. Come lunch, she tells me she's outside and she has hot cocoa for everyone\
  \ in my office. I told her I didn't really like that she just showed up and that\
  \ I didn't know if anyone would want any. I go around my office and find that about\
  \ half of them wanted some so I go back to my girlfriend in her car and tell her\
  \ that I'll take the cocoa and pass it around. She tells me that she wants to come\
  \ in too and let them know that she got it for them. She's never met a single person\
  \ in my office so I told her I felt uncomfortable with her showing up and suddenly\
  \ meeting everyone. She got really mad at this and started asking why I couldn't\
  \ just appreciate the surprise. I told her it would be like if I just showed up\
  \ at her school, and she told me that there isn't any security at my office so it's\
  \ probably fine. I didn't budge. She got mad and left. I took the cocoa and told\
  \ everyone that got one that my GF bought them, but she's still pissed at me and\
  \ I'm still upset she doesn't seem to understand my side.\n\nAm I overreacting here?\n\
  \n\nEdit: A few more important notes. I'm in my early 20s and the newest person\
  \ in my office (been there for under 6 months), my office is entirely people in\
  \ their 30s and up. Most of them are married with children but I have yet to meet\
  \ a single spouse. This is a big part of why I thought it would be inappropriate\
  \ for her to come in.\n\n\nEdit 2: I also feel like I shouldn't have to say this,\
  \ but I'm not cheating on my GF. I have no secret office romances.\n\n\n\n\nEdit\
  \ 3/ Update: hey guys, Asshole here. So I spoke to my GF last night and cleared\
  \ everything up. I apologized for not being more immediately receptive to the nice\
  \ treat and she apologized for putting me in an awkward situation. We talked about\
  \ whether she would like to come in today and just say meet some of my co-workers.\
  \ I told her I would ask my boss. \n\nHe told me that while the gifts were appreciated,\
  \ I should wait till our Christmas party to introduce my GF.\n\nIn conclusion, I've\
  \ learned that all of you are wrong and that you should never trust Reddit. Also\
  \ I just want to give a big shout out to Christina Applegate and all the guys in\
  \ this thread who advised my GF to break up with me."
