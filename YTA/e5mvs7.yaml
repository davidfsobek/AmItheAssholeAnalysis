selftext: "I \\[27F\\] have been dating my BF \\[28M\\] for 6 years and we've lived\
  \ together for 4 of those years. He recently bought a flat in a city and we moved\
  \ in together, I assumed he had a mortgage and we'd split it but he said that as\
  \ I wasn't buying the flat with him he'd pay it himself and I'd just contribute\
  \ to expenses. I was a bit upset that he didn't ask me to contribute or didn't want\
  \ me to buy the place with him, but I was very happy living near my work and not\
  \ having to pay an expensive rent. We've split the place up so that we have our\
  \ bedroom, then we each get a \"den\". He turned his into a home office and I've\
  \ made my room into a sort of cinema/knitting room. \n\nApart from the odd argument\
  \ here and there we haven't had any issues and we're very much in love, though he's\
  \ never brought up marriage it's something I see in our future and have tried to\
  \ bring up in discussions. We don't really share finances or anything as he earns\
  \ quite a bit more than me, so I just send him a monthly amount that covers my share\
  \ of the bills. We don't have a joint account for the house, we don't discuss our\
  \ expenses and in truth when it comes to finances we're more like room-mates than\
  \ a couple. \n\nI know I had no right to and I'm completely TA here, but I was putting\
  \ his mail in his office and noticed one of the letters was from \"Credit Suisse\"\
  . I was curious and opened it to find it was a statement of investments and when\
  \ I explored a bit more I found more statements that show he had a lot of money\
  \ and investments around. There's also no mortgage on the flat and he bought it\
  \ outright.\n\nI confronted him about it when he got home and this led to a huge\
  \ argument. He said I had no right to go snooping through his stuff and he's right,\
  \ but I was upset that he had hid this from me. I brought up that we'd have to share\
  \ finances when we got married and he said \"I'm never getting married, I don't\
  \ believe in it\". This made me even more upset as it makes it seem like we don't\
  \ have a shared future together.\n\nAITA for being angry and upset that he hid his\
  \ wealth from me and never brought it up?"
