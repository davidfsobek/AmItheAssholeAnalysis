selftext: "I work in a large office, but on a smaller team of about 15 people. One\
  \ of the girls on my team, Zoe, has a 5 year old named Violet. Zoe is very overweight.\
  \ Probably close to 350-400lbs. She's a wonderful woman and I consider her a friend,\
  \ both in and out of the office.\n\nViolet is 5 and Zoe has mentioned a few times\
  \ this year that she's worried Violet will follow in her footsteps. She's starting\
  \ to gain weight, although she's not 'overweight' yet. Zoe is worried about putting\
  \ Violet on a diet. I've told her that kids Violets age don't need to go on a 'diet'\
  \ perse, they just need to learn what to eat and exercise, which shouldn't be difficult\
  \ for a 5 year old. \n\nZoe has been making small changes in Violets day to day\
  \ activity. She's put her in swimming and horseback riding and she's making sure\
  \ they walk more (parking further away from stores, etc) but she seems lost on the\
  \ nutrition. She mentioned yesterday that she got this thing called Yonanas (??)\
  \ that makes banana ice cream?  I don't know exactly, I guess it's a machine that\
  \ mushes frozen bananas into 'ice cream'.. She told me, very proudly, that she would\
  \ be giving Violet this banana ice cream every night instead of ice cream. I asked\
  \ her how many bananas she would be giving her and if she would be putting toppings\
  \ and stuff on the 'ice cream' because 1 banana is over 100 calories. If she mashed\
  \ 3 bananas and then adds chocolate chips or something, that's well over 400 calories,\
  \ which is more than a serving of ice cream. I also mentioned a kid shouldn't get\
  \ a 'bedtime' snack every night as it's usually calories they don't need. \n\nZoe\
  \ got kind of defensive and told me that she's trying and I need to lay off. I was\
  \ honestly caught off guard because I'm not trying to parent Violet, or make Zoe\
  \ feel like a bad mom. I was really just trying to let her know that calories matter.\
  \ Not just what she's eating, but how much. 400 calories of bananas is still 400\
  \ calories. Zoe was very curt with me the rest of the day and hasn't spoken to me\
  \ today. I feel bad, but I know what it's like to grow up overweight. It's not fun\
  \ and if I had learned the basics of living a healthy life at Violets age, it would\
  \ have saved me a lot of pain and grief.\n\n*Edit* because I think people are not\
  \ reading what I wrote and are assuming I'm suggesting a 5 year old count calories.\
  \ I am NOT suggesting any of this burden be placed on the child. I am ONLY suggesting\
  \ that her mother keep an eye on how much her child is eating. If the child eats\
  \ 250 calories of ice cream a day and she switches to 400 calories of bananas, isn't\
  \ that making things worse? On the other hand, if the child is eating 500 calories\
  \ of ice cream a day and then switches to 400 calories of bananas, that's an improvement.\
  \ You don't know that unless you count the calories.\n\n*Edit 2* I finally got the\
  \ chance to talk to Zoe today and she's not mad. She said she was annoyed yesterday,\
  \ but she knows I was trying to help. I apologized and told her I wouldn't be getting\
  \ involved in this anymore and if she wanted to still talk and vent to me, that\
  \ I would be here to listen and not offer any advice. She seemed appreciative. She\
  \ also said she tried the Yonanas last night by mashing 3 whole bananas and giving\
  \ Violet half and she ate half. She added about a TBSP of chocolate chips to Violet's.\
  \ She said it was probably 1/2 cup of banana ice cream, which is a good treat. \n\
  \nI'm really sorry I offended so many people. I in no way think giving a small child\
  \ a food complex is a good idea. I don't want her to think she needs to lose weight.\
  \ That's not my intention.\n\nAlso, to the person who called my friend a fatass.\
  \ Kindly go fuck yourself."
