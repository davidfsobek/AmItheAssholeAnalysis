selftext: "I wanted to do something nice for my mom for her birthday, so I decided\
  \ to paint her a picture. I oil paint as a hobby. \nI made a really sweet picture,\
  \ I don\u2019t want to post it here because it\u2019s personal, but it was a picture\
  \ of my mom smiling and holding my younger brother, as my dad pushed me on the swing\
  \ in the background. It took me like 6 weeks or so to finish this painting. \nI\
  \ gave it to my mom, and she cried she loved it. \nMy parents aren\u2019t together\
  \ anymore but they were good friends until my mom met my step dad. \nFirst thing\
  \ he said when she opened the painting was, \u201Cwell, where am I?\u201D\nThis\
  \ pissed me off and I ignored it but he kept going, saying if I needed a reference\
  \ picture I could have asked him, and calling me rude and \u201Cexclusionary\u201D\
  \ because he\u2019s a part of the family too and kept going on and on. I told him\
  \ I didn\u2019t paint him because I can\u2019t stand to look at his face for that\
  \ long. He slammed the table like a petulant child and stormed out. \nMy mom scolded\
  \ me for being rude, and asked me to apologize for not putting him in the painting.\
  \ WHAT? I still haven\u2019t said a word to this man, it\u2019s been about three\
  \ weeks. My mom also hasn\u2019t hung the picture up which really hurts my feelings.\
  \ AITA?"
