selftext: "\nMy best friend Michael (28M) has been with his girlfriend Johanna (29F)\
  \ for 11 years since highschool. I (28M) recently proposed to my fianc\xE9e Lily\
  \ (26F) and we've been together for just shy of 3 years. \n\nEarlier this week Johanna\
  \ mentioned to me and Lily at a party how she can't wait for Michael to propose\
  \ to her and how she can't wait to have her fairytale wedding. \n\nI, admittedly,\
  \ laughed and told Johanna that after 11 years together if a guy hasn't proposed\
  \ to you yet he probably never will.   I was also a little shocked because up until\
  \ that point I thought both Michael and Johanna were on the same page and didn't\
  \ believe in marriage (I know for a fact that Michael doesn't want to tie the knot\
  \ but I didn't mention that to Johanna). \n\nJohanna got defensive and started arguing\
  \ that a lot of couples wait a long time before marriage and not everyone rushes\
  \ into marriage like us. I just sort of reiterated my point that 11 years is longer\
  \ than average and I wouldn't be surprised if Michael never proposes. I also told\
  \ Johanna straight up if she wants a proposal in the future she should probably\
  \ have a serious conversation with Michael about it. \n\nWell, on the uber ride\
  \ back home my fianc\xE9e Lily was horrified with what I'd said to Johanna. She\
  \ doesn't think it's any of my business and what I said to Johanna was rude. In\
  \ my opinion I was doing Johanna a favour.  I mean someone needs to tell her the\
  \ reality that Michael is unlikely to propose. I do recognize I may have created\
  \ some trouble for my friend but Johanna is my friend as well and I was trying to\
  \ give it to her straight. \n\n\nAm I an asshole?"
