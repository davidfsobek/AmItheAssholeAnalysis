selftext: "So I\u2019m a 18M. My coworker is a 17F at a small, family restaurant -\
  \ we\u2019ll call her A. A and I have gotten quite close over the last two months,\
  \ and she told me that her mom passed away from cancer when she was 7 years old.\
  \ \n\nLast week, us two and two other coworkers were talking about parenting methods\
  \ and how sometimes strict parenting doesn\u2019t work. A chimes in and says, \u201C\
  I\u2019m so glad that my parents aren\u2019t strict on me at all, I\u2019m allowed\
  \ to do whatever\u201D.  I was confused but didn\u2019t say anything at first, but\
  \ then as the conversation progressed she kept using the phrase \u201Cparents\u201D\
  . \n\nWhen the other two coworkers left I asked her why she used the phrase \u201C\
  parents\u201D when she technically only had one. She then started crying. I really\
  \ wasn\u2019t expecting this - it\u2019s been 10 years, but I apologized a few hours\
  \ later.\n\nI was telling my other coworkers what happened, and they said that I\
  \ was an asshole for even asking her. I apologized, I don\u2019t think I was an\
  \ asshole, it was a fair question IMO.\n\nAITA?"
