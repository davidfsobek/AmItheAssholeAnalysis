selftext: "Throwaway account. Names are changed for privacy reasons. \n\nWe pulled\
  \ names for Secret Santa at work in early November. The coworker who I got is named\
  \ Julia, and we're more or less friends. I decided to get her a personalized name\
  \ necklace because I remembered she said she liked the Carrie necklace when we were\
  \ talking about Sex in the City. It was about $25 on Black Friday.\n\nThen, last\
  \ night (late Tuesday), Julia came out as a transgender man, FtM. Good for him.\
  \ But he also announced his new name would be Victor, and I immediately thought\
  \ it'd be rude to gift him a necklace with his old name. \n\nSo I asked the store\
  \ if I could change the name, and they said the necklace was already in the middle\
  \ of production so it was impossible, and they said no refunds since the necklace\
  \ is made to order.  They gave me a 15% off coupon if I wanted to repurchase any\
  \ jewelry from their shop. But they no longer have any Black Friday/Cyber Monday\
  \ sales, so a new piece would be about $45 with the 15% off coupon. It especially\
  \ sucks because I splurged on gifts for other friends and family this year, so I'm\
  \ living a little frugally at the moment and I don't have the budget for anything\
  \ extra until the end of the year. \n\nAnyways, the Julia necklace I bought is coming\
  \ whether I like it or not, and I was wondering if I should just gift it. I know\
  \ some people wouldn't mind receiving a present like that given the circumstances,\
  \ but other people might find it extremely offensive, and I'm not sure which camp\
  \ Victor is in. WIBTA if I gifted my transgender coworker a necklace with his previous\
  \ name?"
