selftext: "I have a friend in my main circle that has recently started describing\
  \ herself as curvy. She\u2019s not though. She put on a few pounds recently to become\
  \ barely above underweight with chicken hips still and thinks she has curves because\
  \ she just got fake knockers. She keeps saying things like \u201Cit feels great\
  \ to be curvy\u201D, \u201Cguys have started noticing my curves\u201D, etc. She\
  \ hasn\u2019t referred to us as curvy nor have we categorized our own figures aloud.\
  \ \n\n\nNo one has said anything to her about it for over a month, but we do talk\
  \ about it when she\u2019s not around. Some of us think she\u2019s saying that to\
  \ make us actual curvy girls feel fat. I\u2019m actually curvy unlike her. I have\
  \ a natural hourglass figure. \n\n\nToday, that friend said to me and another actual\
  \ curvy friend \u201Cbeing curvy is great but us curvy girls got to always watch\
  \ what we eat or we\u2019d become straight up fat in no time\u201D. I told her \u201C\
  yo chicken hips, you\u2019re not even close to curvy like [name of that curvy friend]\
  \ and I\u201D. She said \u201Ccalm down [my name], there\u2019s different degrees\
  \ of curvy\u201D. I said \u201Cstop calling yourself curvy since it\u2019s making\
  \ us actual curvy girls feel fat\u201D. She said \u201Calright chill girl\u201D\
  . Hopefully she doesn\u2019t call herself curvy again."
