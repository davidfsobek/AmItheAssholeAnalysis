selftext: 'I''m m23 and she''s f21, we''ve been together for 2 years and living together
  for a year now. I work full time and she''s in school so she has a good amount of
  free time, since she doesn''t work. She''s always cooked for me a lot and taken
  care of me even before we moved in, but when we did move we made a deal where I
  would cover the cost of groceries and bills and she''d make me lunch and make dinner
  every night. She''s a fucking amazing cook and homemaker, her lunches are gourmet
  and her dinners are better than most restaurants so I thought this was a fair deal.
  She came to me last time pretty upset and said she doesn''t want to cook as much
  anymore, we do go out once per week for date night though. I said that we agreed
  to this so its shitty for her to back out of this since I don''t know how to cook
  and will starve. She called me an ass and we''ve been kinda distant today.
