selftext: "I\u2019m 18F and Harry is 18M. There\u2019s a guy at my high school that\
  \ I\u2019m kind of friends with. He\u2019s really smart but since middle school\
  \ he\u2019s asked two of my friends out and been rejected. You get the idea. \n\n\
  Anyway, winter prom is fast approaching and nobody had asked me yet so I decided\
  \ to ask Harry. I walked up to him while he was chatting with his friends and figured\
  \ this would be simple. But when I asked him I wanted to make sure the terms were\
  \ clear. I told him directly that this is just platonic and he shouldn\u2019t have\
  \ any ideas that my request indicates any interest in him **at all**. We would only\
  \ be going as friends and I\u2019m not at all interested  in anything romantic with\
  \ him. \n\nEven though he doesn\u2019t have a date he told me right there that he\
  \ wasn\u2019t interested because somehow telling him not to misinterpret the invitation\
  \ was somehow rude. His friends laughed at me and now he\u2019s been avoiding me\
  \ even though he still doesn\u2019t have a date. Have I done something wrong here?"
