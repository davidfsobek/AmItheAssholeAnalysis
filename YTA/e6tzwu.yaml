selftext: "This happened a long time ago but came up because my mom is going to have\
  \ minor surgery and is supposed to be in the hospital over the weekend.\n\nMy wife\
  \ comes from a large family and for the most part they are incredible. However,\
  \ one of their quirks is they feel that if one of them is in the hospital someone\
  \ HAS to be there, ALL THE TIME. I learned about this when my mother-in-law had\
  \ knee surgery and my wife and her siblings were making a schedule of who would\
  \ be there every minute of the day. I told my wife I thought it was odd but she\
  \ thought I was crazy for NOT thinking someone should be there all of the time.\n\
  \nThe other day my wife asked what our plan was for this weekend. She said she wanted\
  \ to  go to the local Christmas parade Saturday morning but was afraid that we wouldn't\
  \ be able to go. I told her it shouldn't be a problem and I assured her that my\
  \ mother would be ok if we didn't visit her until afternoon and joked not everybody\
  \ was as odd as her family.\n\nThat's when it all came out. Apparently my wife is\
  \ still a little salty that I didn't stay in the hospital with her when our first\
  \ child was born!\n\nIn early February, 2000, my wife was pregnant and two weeks\
  \ passed due. Her doctor scheduled her to be induced and we were supposed to be\
  \ at the hospital at 630 AM. Of course, neither of us could fall asleep the night\
  \ before until almost just before we had to get up. At eight that night, with no\
  \ signs of our daughter coming,the Dr decided to call it a night and start again\
  \ in the morning. At the end of a very long day, with both of us working on less\
  \ than 3 hours of sleep, we were both completely exhausted. I sat with my wife until\
  \ we both dozed off and woke her and told her I was going to go home and get some\
  \ sleep.\n\nThe next morning I was back at the hospital before 7 AM, at 8 they started\
  \ trying to induce her again. Eventually the Dr decided to perform a c-section.\
  \ I was in the OR with my wife during the birth and we spent that evening with our\
  \ newborn. After midnight I kissed them goodnight and went home to sleep.\n\nI returned\
  \ the next morning and spent most of next day at the hospital with my wife and daughter\
  \ entertaining visitors. I did leave when my mother-in law was there for a few hours\
  \ to get some lunch and decompress. That night I left after everyone was asleep\
  \ to make sure the house was ready and returned the next morning to take my wife\
  \ and daughter home.\n\nApparently, the fact that I left to sleep was an issue.\
  \ My wife never said anything to me then, but it bothered her for years. It wasn't\
  \ until we talked about their schedule for her mom's surgery that she realized 1.not\
  \ everyone expected someone to be there in the hospital with them 24/7 and 2.I had\
  \ no idea she was expecting me to stay the night.\n\nI don't think I did anything\
  \ wrong but it does bother me that I may have caused my wife pain so I have to ask,\
  \ twenty years ago, was I the asshole?\n\n\n\nUpdate for Clarification:\nWell this\
  \ blew up overnight. At the risk of breaking the rule about arguing I would like\
  \ to clarify a few things. I can accept the judgement of asshole but a lot of the\
  \ reasoning is stating \"facts\" that just aren't true. From some of what I've read\
  \ it sounds like I did a slow roll by the hospital and kicked my pregnant wife out\
  \ of the car and went home and chilled until it was time for them to come home.\n\
  \nI've been called a horrible husband and father, it's been suggested my wife should\
  \ have divorced me, been compared to an abusive ex, vilified for waking her up to\
  \ let her know I was leaving, vilified for not waking her up to let her know I was\
  \ leaving, accused of leaving my wife alone in the middle of labor, abandoning her\
  \ in the midst of emergency surgery and several more very shitty things.\n\nSo to\
  \ clarify some things that were edited out because of character limits. The first\
  \ day we were sent home at 630 because they had a bunch of natural deliveries come\
  \ in the night before. They called us back that afternoon and attempted to induce\
  \ labor but my wife was NOT in labor that night. They stopped the inducing drugs\
  \ and the decision was made to start trying again the next morning. They gave her\
  \ something to help her rest and several hours later we both were dozing in and\
  \ out of sleep. I only left after a nurse suggested we both needed to get some rest\
  \ for the next day and hinted several times I should leave. When the nurse came\
  \ for a vital check and mentioned again we both needed to get some rest I told my\
  \ half awake wife I would go so she could sleep. She said okay but never said anything\
  \ about wanting me to stay. I was gone that night six hours max and my wife was\
  \ still asleep the next morning when I got back.\n\nDay two, induction started early\
  \ but labor never came. After the c-section, we spent several hours together with\
  \ the baby. Later that night, again, at the suggestion of the nurse that we both\
  \ needed to get some rest, I said something about leaving so she could sleep. My\
  \ wife said ok and didn't say anything about me staying the night. I sat with her\
  \ until she fell asleep, checked in at the nursery where my daughter was asleep\
  \ and went home for about five hours.\n\nDay three I was at the hospital all day\
  \ except when I stepped out when my MIL was there. Both mother and baby were doing\
  \ great and the doctor said they would be released the next morning. I left that\
  \ night after midnight again to make sure we hadn't forgotten any baby things and\
  \ to install the car seat. Talked to my wife about leaving and she never said anything\
  \ about wanting me to stay the night. I sat with her until she was asleep, checked\
  \ in at the nursery and went home.\n\nI had no idea she had any expectation of me\
  \ to stay. I didn't even know that was an option. I was nervous about being there\
  \ after visiting hours as it was. 20 years ago fathers were still treated more like\
  \ a nuisance than a partner.\n\nIt wasn't until several years later that my wife\
  \ told me about how her grandfather hated and was terrified of hospitals and insisted\
  \ that someone be with him every second he was there. That has carried over to everyone\
  \ in her family but I didn't know this until even later when her mom had surgery.\
  \ It was only when we were talking about her mother's visiting schedule that I realized\
  \ her family felt this way and she realized not every body expects a hospital chaperone\
  \ 24/7.\n\nAgain, call me an asshole if you will but please do so based on facts\
  \ instead of assumptions. I would have slept on the floor if my wife had asked.\
  \ I just didn't know it was expected or allowed.\n\n\nUpdate Part 2\nI fully expected\
  \ to be called an asshole BUT I am honestly surprised by the amount of hateful comments\
  \ I've received. I've been called some things I've never even heard of and some\
  \ I have. My favorite so far is a \"bag of dicks.\"  Either way, it's been a good\
  \ way to kill the time while my mom is in surgery\n\nFor everyone saying I should\
  \ apologize to my wife, I did, years ago. When we were discussing her mothers surgery\
  \ schedule and realized we came from such different places I asked her did that\
  \ mean I was supposed to be there 24/7 when she had the kids. She said not with\
  \ the second two because I was watching the other one, then two. But for the first\
  \ child, yes, I should have and she was upset that I didn't stay. I apologized and\
  \ asked for forgiveness because I had no idea. She said she realized I didn't know\
  \ and said she understood and forgave me. The only reason it came up and I made\
  \ this post is when we were talking about my moms surgery, my wife made a joke about\
  \ staying the night. I know she was joking but after 22+years I could tell there\
  \ was a little something behind the joke. If I only knew then what I know now. \
  \  For the record---I have absolutely no feeling that she is the asshole, we didn't\
  \ communicate very well but she is definitely NOT the asshole here.\n\nThe other\
  \ common comment is a mocking \"Poor baby was tired and had to go sleep in a comfy\
  \ bed while his wife suffered alone.\" I seriously think you guys are overestimating\
  \ how long I was gone each night, but OK. The longest I was away from the hospital\
  \ was for less than 6 hours on the first night and my wife literally slept the whole\
  \ time I was gone.  By the time I drove home (30 minutes), checked on and fed the\
  \ cat, was able to fall asleep, got up, showered, got ready and drove back I actually\
  \ slept about three hours that first night and about two hours the next two nights.\
  \ I honestly probably would have gotten more sleep if I had stayed at the hospital.\
  \ \n\nI left because I thought I was supposed to, not because I wanted to. Also,\
  \ I didn't know I even could stay. Several have mentioned that 20 years ago was\
  \ not that long ago and husbands everywhere had been staying the night but that\
  \ was not the case in my experience. We had three kids in the same hospital, when\
  \ our third child was born in 2003, the nurses offered me pillows and a blanket\
  \ and made it clear that it was OK to stay the night. In 2000 and 2001 the nurses\
  \ never said anything about staying, I don't know how many times I heard the same\
  \ speech at the desk, in the room, from other rooms, in the hallway, \"Visiting\
  \ hours are over at 10. Everyone has to be out by then except dad who can stay a\
  \ little while longer ...if mom wants him around, that is.\" but every nurse on\
  \ the floor said the same thing both of the first two times we were there. I know\
  \ I'm an idiot but honestly at the time I had no idea you could stay overnight in\
  \ the hospital, I thought that was why they had visiting hours.\n\nAnyway, thanks\
  \ for the ride, I know I'm the asshole! Also, thanks to the people who messaged\
  \ because they knew their not asshole comments would be buried and that was the\
  \ only way I'd see them. The words of the sympathetic mothers, midwives and nurses\
  \ were very appreciated."
