selftext: "So my University partners with the local Pizza Hut, and after 8pm we can\
  \ order food using our declining balance (essentially coal miner bucks that we are\
  \ given at the beginning of each semester). However, they up charge all of their\
  \ products, so a $40 order ends up being $50 when using decking balance.\n\nSo last\
  \ night I ordered a med pizza and two orders of wings using this method, and when\
  \ my driver arrived (late 50s early 60s) he put the food in my hand and immediately\
  \ went on a rant about how \u201Cwe do everything for you guys, we do accept tips\
  \ you know\u201D. I told him that I\u2019m sorry but if I had actual money I wouldn\u2019\
  t be paying with my university card. I asked if he had Venmo, I had like $8 in my\
  \ bank account, and he just got in his car and sped off.\n\nI know that they mainly\
  \ rely on tips, but when the restaurant charges $10 more than the actual price I\
  \ assume that it\u2019s for a reason. \n\nP.s. you aren\u2019t allowed to tip with\
  \ your declining balance which is bullshit.\n\nEDIT: spelling"
