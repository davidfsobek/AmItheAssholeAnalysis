selftext: "This is awful and I can't begin to explain how devastating it is. \n\n\
  My friends 14 months old daughter passed in her sleep last week. An awful case of\
  \ SIDS, nobody could  do anything. Funeral are next week and I plan to be there\
  \ the whole day to support my friend.\n\nHere's my problem. I have a 4 months old\
  \ who I breastfeed (+two older kids). I'm wondering if I would be TA if i bring\
  \ her so I can feed her directly. \n\nIf I was to leave her with my husband and\
  \ older kids, I'd have to pump all week to get enough milk for the day (I can only\
  \ pump like 50ml each time, if I'm lucky.) \n\nSide note: this is not about leaving\
  \ Baby with his father. We do everything 100% together, he is as much a parent as\
  \ i am and not a babysitter.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all for your imput, consider me\
  \ judge. I won't be bringing Baby. Some of you added very good point to the NO list,\
  \ and I'm grateful for this. I'll be able to give 100% of my attention to my friend\
  \ and his family."
