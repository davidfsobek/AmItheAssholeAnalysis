selftext: "I\u2019m almost 30 and I have a 15 year old sister. We were raised in very\
  \ different times. When I was her age, we had straight, lesbians (masculine lesbians\
  \ were called \u201Cbutch\u201D), gay men, bisexuals, cross-dressers, and transsexuals.\
  \ These were the terms everyone used and I have met people of all types who didn\u2019\
  t seem to disagree with any of this terminology, although I didn\u2019t really ask\
  \ how they felt about it. It\u2019s just what everyone was labeled as. I\u2019m\
  \ a straight woman, and it\u2019s not my place to question or judge anyone in the\
  \ LGBTQ+ community for what they wish to be called in regards to their orientation\
  \ or identity.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019m having trouble with using people\u2019s preferred\
  \ pronouns. For example, my sister has a 15 year old friend who was born male, dresses\
  \ masculine, looks masculine, but identifies as non binary. I keep accidentally\
  \ using the pronouns \u201Che\u201D \u201Chim\u201D and \u201Chis\u201D when referring\
  \ to them. I genuinely don\u2019t mean to do it, I was taught in school that \u201C\
  they\u201D and \u201Cthem\u201D were used as a generalization or to be used as a\
  \ plural. Another example is her 13 year old friend who was born female and dresses\
  \ very feminine but identifies as male. He even goes by a new name he picked for\
  \ himself. I am constantly correcting myself around him because I keep saying \u201C\
  she\u201D and \u201Cher\u201D. My sister immediately gets pissed when this happens.\n\
  \nI\u2019m not sure how PC this part of the story will be, so I\u2019m sorry if\
  \ this offends anyone. Can you really decide something like this at such a young\
  \ age? They\u2019re just so young. I say this mostly because her gender identity\
  \ has changed 3 times in the past year. Is it really fair to expect everyone to\
  \ start calling you a \u201Che\u201D in January and then \u201Cthey\u201D in June\
  \ and then \u201Cshe\u201D again in October without ever using the wrong pronoun\
  \ by accident? Our family has to be so cautious all the time not to call her the\
  \ wrong thing or she shuts down and will hardly speak to any of us.\n\nShe gets\
  \ really upset at me and our mom and barely speaks to me at all anymore because\
  \ of this. It just sucks that she cares so deeply about her and her friends being\
  \ accepted for who they are while seemingly not accepting me for who I am. Sometimes\
  \ I feel like she hates me just because I was raised in a different time and taught\
  \ different things. I\u2019m trying to learn and change for her but I\u2019m human\
  \ and I make mistakes. The worst part is that when I tell her I\u2019m having trouble\
  \ understanding certain terms or identifications, or ask her why she chose to identify\
  \ as something, she immediately gets annoyed and goes to her room instead of trying\
  \ to explain it to me. I can easily just google it, sure, but it\u2019s more important\
  \ to me to hear her understanding and feelings about it to better understand her\
  \ as a person of the new era. These kids are our future and I think it\u2019s crucial\
  \ for older generations to learn with them. \n\nSorry for the winded story. I just\
  \ miss feeling connected to my sister.\nAITA?"
