selftext: "My step daughter has autism and though intellectually she's fairly typical,\
  \ her executive function isn't the best.  She  struggles with things like planning,\
  \ focusing, remembering and following instructions, and juggling multiple tasks.\
  \ If she's given too much stimuli at once, she just sort of shuts down. It also\
  \ takes her a long time to process things. Sometimes strangers think she's rude\
  \ because they'll say something to her and she doesn't respond right away, but it's\
  \ just because her brain is a little different and takes her longer to internalize\
  \ the info and come up with a response.\n\nHer dad and I have never tried to coddle\
  \ her because of her disability. We try to push her to exceed other people's very\
  \ low expectations of her. It hasn't always been smooth sailing, but we've tried\
  \ to balance accommodating her neurodiversity with helping her achieve maximum independence.\
  \ I love her so much and I'm honestly so proud of her for everything she's overcome.\
  \ \n\nRecently she turned 16 and has expressed interest in driving. Her mom says\
  \ it's out of the question but my husband had always believed her mother doesn't\
  \ give her enough credit. Generally I agree with him, but I'm not so sure this time.\
  \ I think my step daughter is capable of achieving a lot. I also feel she's capable\
  \ of being able to pass a *written* driver's test, but I'm almost certain she wouldn't\
  \ pass a road test. The road is so unpredictable and her reaction time is so slow\
  \ and changing situations and sudden events almost cause physical paralysis until\
  \ she can mentally regroup. My thought process is, if playing a fast-paced video\
  \ game can overstimulate her and make her shut down, what would happen if someone\
  \ pulled out in front of her unexpectedly?\n\nMy husband wants to take her to get\
  \ a learner's permit. When I gently tried to explain that I didn't think it would\
  \ be safe, for her or for other people on the road, my husband accused me of selling\
  \ her short and trying to baby her like the rest of the world does. He thinks I\
  \ should at least give her a chance and we don't know how she'll do until we let\
  \ her try. His plan is to take her to empty parking lots and drive on country back\
  \ roads to build up her confidence, but I just don't see this ending well no matter\
  \ what happens. AITA?"
