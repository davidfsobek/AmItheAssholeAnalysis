selftext: "I live in a very religiously diverse but uniethnic country. I'm specifically\
  \ from a village of only 3200 and my high school is very small with 250 students\
  \ total. On the positive it's a highly casual atmosphere, on the negative classes\
  \ are very limited. \n\nIf we want certain classes (like career programs) we have\
  \ to commute during the school day to larger cities for that. I'm in a program for\
  \ early childhood education at a large school (3200 students - same amount of students\
  \ in that school than people that live in my village) in the closest city. The problem\
  \ is, that school is incredibly strict. \n\nThe uniform is very lenient at my home\
  \ high school, but the city high schools uniform is very specific. It was determined\
  \ us part-time students will be excluded from full uniform as long as we abide by\
  \ a strict formal dress code. \n\nI want to get my hair dyed a \"loud\" color. My\
  \ home schools head teacher confirmed this would be no problem here, but the assistant\
  \ head teacher at the other school said I wouldn't be allowed to participate in\
  \ any classes there if any unnatural hair color was showing. I've been considering\
  \ wearing a hijab during my trips to the other school, but some peoole (ironically\
  \ non-muslims) have noted that would be insensitive and would make me an asshole.\
  \ \n\nWIBTA for wearing a hijab as an athiest to conceal dyed hair?\n\nEdit 1: info"
