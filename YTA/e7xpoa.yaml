selftext: "I work in construction. My daughter Laura is 18 and will be finishing her\
  \ A Levels next year, but isn't sure what she wants to do. \n\nWhile studying she\
  \ wanted a part time job to earn some pocket money. She wasn't having much luck\
  \ so I paid for her to do CSCS (UK Construction Health and Safety) training so she\
  \ can work as a labourer for me. Mainly carrying equipment around, cleaning up after\
  \ me but I also let her have a go at some of the more skilled aspects of the building\
  \ trade. She didn't enjoy it to begin with, but over time she got used to it, and\
  \ very recently said she's enjoying it and would consider it as a career path for\
  \ the future. \n\nI was surprised. She's a total girly girl so I wasn't expecting\
  \ this from her, but as a dad I couldn't be more proud she wants to follow me. \n\
  \nI still discouraged it though. Not because I think she'll be bad at it or that\
  \ I think it's not a job for women, but because I know what sort of attitudes exist\
  \ in that industry. My wife works in a male dominated sector (cyber security) and\
  \ had to work twice as hard to prove herself. She's worked in teams where she was\
  \ told to make the teas while the men worked and other humiliating things like that.\
  \ I think my daughter could be good my sort of work, but construction is so male\
  \ dominated that she'll never have a chance. \n\nI told this to her and she got\
  \ upset and isn't speaking to me. My wife (who has been extremely vocal about the\
  \ struggles she's faced professionally) was fuming at me for being discouraging.\
  \ We always said we'd support whatever path she took. but I think following me into\
  \ construction will lead to a lot of bullying and humiliation for her down the line.\
  \ \n\nDid I do the right thing?"
