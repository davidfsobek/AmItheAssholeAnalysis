selftext: 'I (28F) have been dating my wonderful fiance (30M) for a little over three
  years now. I can''t imagine a better partner. He is kind, considerate, and extremely
  smart, and is without a doubt the person I want to spend the rest of my life with.
  He has struggled with social anxiety his whole life and can''t work because of it,
  so our agreement is that I work full-time and he handles all of the household chores,
  like cooking and cleaning. We''re planning to start a family soon, and we''ve agreed
  to have him be a stay at home dad while I continue to focus on my career. I know
  this may not be the most traditional arrangement, but it works for us and we''re
  very happy with the way things are.


  My parents (late 40s M and F) have been extremely unsupportive of our relationship
  from the beginning, and especially after we got engaged. They''re nice to his face,
  but they can''t get over the fact that he''s never had a job. Whenever he''s not
  around, they keep harassing me about making him find some sort of employment, which
  is obnoxious and honestly none of their business.


  A few days ago, my mom freaked out when I said we were planning to have children
  within the next two years and said some really awful things, including that I''m
  throwing away my future and that this would be a "terrible environment" to raise
  kids in. I snapped and said they were being incredibly rude and that we would no
  longer by visiting them for Christmas this year, or for the foreseeable future,
  until they apologize and treat us with more respect.


  I''ve been getting calls and texts from other family members who keep telling me
  to make nice, and I''m tempted to just cut all of them off at this point, honestly.
  AITA?'
