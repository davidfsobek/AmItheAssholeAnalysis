selftext: "My daughter got her first period at school on Friday. I am her father,\
  \ and she typically is more comfortable talking to her mother about things like\
  \ this, so on Friday she calls my wife in tears since she was distressed.\n\nMy\
  \ wife and I were both at work, but due to the nature of our jobs I am more at liberty\
  \ to step out of the office. So my wife called me and asked me to bring my daughter\
  \ some tampons. I went to a pharmacy, picked up some tampons, and drove them over\
  \ to her school. \n\nShe was in class with about 40 minutes left, and I had to get\
  \ back to work, so I knocked on the door and the teacher said to come in to the\
  \ classroom. I am familiar with the teacher, so there was no issue. I just said\
  \ I had something to drop off for my daughter, and handed her the tampons in a plastic\
  \ bag. Herein lies the issue: apparently the plastic bag was somewhat see-through,\
  \ and my daughter was mortified.\n\nMy daughter confronted me that night saying\
  \ it was the most embarrassing thing in the world having her dad hand her tampons\
  \ in the middle of class, and my wife agrees with her. I explained that I had to\
  \ enter the class since I couldn't just wait outside for 40 minutes, and that I\
  \ didn't realize the plastic bag was that transparent. Also, I didn't consider that\
  \ it would be so embarrassing anyways, I just felt like it's a normal bodily function\
  \ and nothing to be super embarrassed about (though I know young teenagers think\
  \ much differently).\n\nI apologized to my daughter for embarrassing her, but she\
  \ will have none of it. She was terrified to go into school today. I understand\
  \ my daughter being so upset, but even my wife seems to have zero appreciation that\
  \ I took an hour out of my work day to bring tampons to my daughter - instead all\
  \ I am receiving is anger and blame. \n\nAITA?\n\nSome Info: There is no school\
  \ nurse, and no intense security (people can pretty much come and go as they please\
  \ if they check in with the office first). I do not live in the USA and as far as\
  \ I am aware, that's how most schools are here"
