selftext: "So here we go. \n\nMy husband was talking to me about his day when he got\
  \ home from work tonight. He told me that his uncle sent out a group text today\
  \ letting everyone know about the dates of their annual ice fishing trip. (\u201C\
  Everyone\u201D being my husband, my father-in-law, my husband\u2019s grandpa, my\
  \ husband\u2019s other uncle and a close family friend.) I asked my husband when\
  \ they were planning on going and my husband said January 16th through the 20th.\
  \ I sort of looked at him for a second waiting for him to say, \u201CBut I know\
  \ your birthday is on the 18th so I\u2019ll figure something out so I can spend\
  \ time with you on your birthday.\u201D And that never came. So I said to him, \u201C\
  Do you know what day my birthday is?\u201D He said he knows my birthday is on the\
  \ 18th but he really wants to go on the trip. I asked him if there was another weekend\
  \ that would work for everyone and he quickly shot it down by saying, \u201CIt\u2019\
  s not my cabin so I can\u2019t control the date.\u201D \n\nMy feelings were really\
  \ hurt so I just left the room and sat on the couch by myself for awhile. He later\
  \ texts me from the other room saying, \u201CDon\u2019t be mad at me.\u201D And\
  \ I responded with \u201CMy feelings are hurt.\u201D Later he came into the room\
  \ and sat by me. I thought he was going to say something but he never did. We went\
  \ to bed and as we were laying down I asked him, \u201CSo what is your plan for\
  \ January then?\u201D He just said that he wants to go on the trip. I asked him\
  \ if he understood why that makes me upset and he responded with \u201CWe can just\
  \ do something the weekend after.\u201D I told him that I would like for him to\
  \ be home for my birthday and don\u2019t want to be home alone for my birthday either.\
  \ He just said again \u201CBut I want to go on the trip\u201D and I said \u201C\
  Well I want my husband to be with me on my birthday.\u201D He just sighed and rolled\
  \ over and said that we will talk about it in the morning. \n\nI understand that\
  \ it\u2019s a fun trip for him to go on and he gets to spend time with some people\
  \ he doesn\u2019t see too often. He gets excited for it every year and I know he\
  \ can\u2019t control the date. We will see what happens in the morning, but am I\
  \ the antagonist for wanting my husband to be with me on my birthday?"
