selftext: 'So 2 years ago my GF with the help of her parents was able to buy a nice
  little home! I was very proud of her and I know she''s very proud of it too. She
  deserves it! Home ownerships not super common at our age and she did spend a good
  portion of her time in college saving for it. She 100% deserves credit for that.
  She saved for it, found it, and help pay the down payment for it. For the past year
  I''ve lived here with her. I try hard to fix things up, I help plan projects, and
  I''ve really tried to customize it to our liking together. I of course also help
  pay the mortgage and all the bills involved. I''ve noticed though anytime the topic
  of the house comes up in casual conversation she always responds with "I''ve had
  my house since..." or "I want to do X with my house." Even when the asker directs
  the question to both of us... I''m not asking for credit on buying the house at
  all. Sometimes I just wish she would say stuff like "I bought our house" or "I want
  X for our house". Am I just being sensitive? It''s not destroying my relationship
  with her or anything but it''s just been bothering me for awhile now and I figured
  some opinions may make me feel better.



  Edit: Seems relatively split so far but the consensus seems to be that''s it''s
  not a huge deal. It really isnt and like I said I wouldnt consider it to be eating
  away at me or anything but its bothering me because it feel like I shouldnt care
  at all. I''m  not asking her to give me any credit in buying or owning the home.
  I know I dont LEGALLY have any stake in it. It''s more just acknowledging that I
  do live here I guess? I wasnt with her to help save back when she bought it so I
  try to make up for it by putting as much into it as I can.


  Edit edit: definitely a lot of logical responses in terms of questioning who owns
  the house. I 100% agree that it''s her house but I guess I''m wondering is if it''s
  wrong to ask her to say "I bought our house". It shows she has legal ownership and
  she can still be proud of it plus it shows the I do in fact live there and doesnt
  sound so much like I just lay around and dont contribute?


  Edit edit edit: I''m at work so it''s hard to reply to everyone! It seems kind of
  split still. I''m going to talk to her about it if it comes up again because it
  seems to be kind of a split. Still a lot of people seem to think I''m questioning
  ownership of the house or something. That''s not at all the case.


  The rest of the edits going forward: I just want everyone to know that I definitely
  plan on spending my life with this girl. I am investing in the place I live with
  ther person I love not because I''m naive but because being with someone requires
  sacrifice, time, recourse, and so much more without expecting to always receive
  something in the end. Not everything and everyone in the world is destined to drop
  you on your face after you invest in them. I really hope those of you focusing on
  that non existent aspect of this discussion look deep down and figure out some of
  those negative thoughts.


  For those of you who locked into the wording difference between house and home I
  think that''s definitely a better way to say it. It''s our home and its definitely
  her house.'
title: AITA for being bothered by how my GF refers to the house we both live in as
  "hers" when in casual conversation with others?
