selftext: "My daughter and my girlfriend spent a day together on Saturday, allowing\
  \ me to catch up on some work. My girlfriend is a makeup artist, and she did a full\
  \ face of makeup on my daughter. Since she is a makeup artist, the makeup looked\
  \ fine, but I was kind of shocked to see such heavy makeup on my ten year old. \n\
  \nMy daughter has asked for makeup a lot recently, and the most she has worn has\
  \ been lip gloss and a little glitter. I\u2019m not too knowledgeable about makeup,\
  \ and her mother isn\u2019t around to give advice on this, so I\u2019ve frequently\
  \ just said no make up, especially as she\u2019s so young. So, seeing her with eye\
  \ shadow, blush, and lip color was pretty shocking.\n\nSince we were still going\
  \ out later, I made my daughter wash off the makeup. I did not want her going out\
  \ with it. I\u2019m okay with my girlfriend doings a makeover for fun at home, but\
  \ I don\u2019t think she\u2019s meant to go out with it. My daughter was not pleased\
  \ to have to wash it off, and I had to help her because she was not getting it all\
  \ off. Obviously in my daughter\u2019s eyes, I\u2019m the ass hole.\n\nBut then\
  \ my girlfriend said that I\u2019m being too strict, that all girls wear make up,\
  \ and that I should start letting my daughter wear at least a little bit of make\
  \ up. I said okay, but that make over was not a little bit of makeup. Still, though,\
  \ my girlfriend thinks that I should have let my daughter wear it for the rest of\
  \ the day, just for fun. Then she started asking if I don\u2019t trust her skills\
  \ or think she\u2019s a good makeup artist, and it\u2019s not that, I was just not\
  \ comfortable with my daughter going out with a full face of makeup. AITA?"
