selftext: "Edit: threw OUT* a diaper beside my head\n\nThrowaway simply because I\
  \ don't want people digging through my history to use things against me.\n\nTrying\
  \ to be as objective as possible.\n\n\n\nSo I'm having lunch with some friends at\
  \ a park yesterday and nearby us theres a family having a picnic with their baby.\
  \ We're minding our own business and them theres. Suddenly one of the parents comes\
  \ over to the bench where we're sitting and throws out a diaper in the garage can\
  \ near where I'm sitting, a couple feet away. I see them approaching with the diaper\
  \ and pause to watch and sure enough they threw it right out next to me. All I do\
  \ is interrupt what I had been saying to my friend and say \"Thats disgusting are\
  \ you kidding me?\". Didnt expect anyone to care.\n\n\nSuddenly the parent stops\
  \ and says \"sorry were you talking to me?\" I didn't want to get into it but literally\
  \ seeing a shitty diaper thrown out just a few feet from my head and sandwich made\
  \ my lunch feel rotten in my mouth so I said casually \"I just think you didn't\
  \ need to throw out a shitty diaper right next to my head\". The parent rolls their\
  \ eyes and said \"it wasnt even poop so you'll be okay\". I say that's not true\
  \ because I can smell shit but theyre already walking away shaking their head and\
  \ I can see them go sit back with the other parent and obviously tells them what\
  \ happened because I see them look over with an audible \"seriously dude?\" now\
  \ everyone is looking at me and my friends are telling me to drop it. I say I guess\
  \ no one cares that my lunch is ruined because we're all siding with the parents\
  \ here.\n\n\nThe parents dont say anything else to me and my friends tell me to\
  \ drop it but I'm pissed that my lunch is ruined so I throw the rest of it out.\
  \ \n\nI might be the asshole here. As we leave I was still mad so when we pass the\
  \ park I say something like \"I guess we all have to cater to people with babies\
  \ now\". One of the parents goes \"seriously?\" again as we pass and my friend apologies\
  \ to them and tells me to drop it. I don't say anything else.\n\n\nMy side is that\
  \ I should be able to eat my lunch in public without someone tossing out shit right\
  \ beside me. Families have the right to public spaces too but so do regular people.\
  \ They could have just as easily bagged the diaper up and thrown it out in a bathroom\
  \ or somewhere more appropriate. \n\n\nI made a joke about it as we go to lunch\
  \ today that hopefully I can eat this time without shit sitting next to me and my\
  \ friend told me again that I need to get over it and that they said it wasnt even\
  \ poop but I'm not going to sift through the garbage to find it and prove myself\
  \ right. I believe I'm in the right to expect some courtesy in a public space but\
  \ my friends told me to shut up about it. So go ahead and give me a fair judgement\
  \ - AITA?\n\nEDIT: just want to add that ours was the only free bench big enough\
  \ for myself and my friends"
