selftext: "My boyfriend and I took a weekend trip to Florida. We were at the beach\
  \ and nearly every guy there was shirtless and every woman was in a bikini. There\
  \ were more overweight than fit people. I was in a bikini and my boyfriend wore\
  \ a shirt and board shorts the entire time. I didn\u2019t know he was self-conscious\
  \ of his body. He\u2019s what they call skinny-fat, which is already better than\
  \ most Americans. I\u2019m a skinny girl too who doesn\u2019t have a big butt and\
  \ thicc thighs, but I don\u2019t let that stop me from wearing a bikini. \n\n\n\
  I asked him why he didn\u2019t take off his shirt. He said he doesn\u2019t feel\
  \ comfortable being shirtless around so many people. I said he\u2019s getting more\
  \ attention by wearing a shirt than being without one since it\u2019s hot and barely\
  \ anyone is wearing a shirt, and now is the perfect time to build up some body confidence.\
  \ He said he\u2019s alright and prefers staying clothed. After a little while I\
  \ pointed out a fat guy that just walked by who was shirtless and looked eight months\
  \ pregnant and if he could give no shits, then my boyfriend could too.\n\n\nHe told\
  \ me to shut the fuck up and stop being an annoying bitch. I apologized for nagging.\
  \ That\u2019s the first time he ever cussed at and intimidated me. I was a little\
  \ terrified for the rest of the trip since he seemed on edge until we got back home."
