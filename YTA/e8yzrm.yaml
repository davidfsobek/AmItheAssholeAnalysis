selftext: "I\u2019m a 4th grade teacher. For our Christmas Party this year, I sent\
  \ home a note letting parents know we would be having a cookie swap. The requirements\
  \ were: there must be 18 cookies (enough for everyone plus teacher and para to take\
  \ home a cookie), cookies must be homemade, cookies must be nut-free, and that since\
  \ I\u2019m gluten free, some gluten free cookies would be great but optional! I\
  \ also requested that parents email me the recipe so I could compile them into a\
  \ book and hand them out to all the kids. I also promised to supply the paper plates\
  \ for the party. \n I followed up with an email letting parents know that gluten\
  \ free cookies were encouraged but not required so that no one felt obligated. \n\
  \nThe kids are so excited and talking all about how they can\u2019t wait to make\
  \ the cookies! They all want to make gluten free cookies for me- how sweet! \nToday,\
  \ I sent out a reminder to parents about the cookie swap and emphasized that they\
  \ must be homemade, nut free, and that gluten free was not required. I also reminded\
  \ them to send in the recipe via the google form I created. \nI received a reply\
  \ from a parent suggesting a card swap instead. She said that 9 year olds cannot\
  \ bake, so the requirement of homemade cookies falls upon the parent, and that because\
  \ there were so many food restrictions, and it was in the middle of the week, it\
  \ was extra burdensome. She mentioned that other parents also felt this was stressful.\
  \ \nThis is the first time I have received negative feedback on the cookie swap\
  \ in 3 years so I want to know, AITA?"
