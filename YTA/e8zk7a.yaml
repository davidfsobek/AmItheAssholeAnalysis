selftext: "My husband's a history teacher at our local high school, and each year,\
  \ he's troubled by the number of students who enter his classes knowing absolutely\
  \ nothing about current events or how the world works. We decided that we wanted\
  \ our two boys, who are currently 8 and 10, to be informed citizens from an early\
  \ age.\n\nWe keep the radio tuned to our local NPR station in the car and make sure\
  \ to watch the nightly news together each night as a family. During dinner, my husband\
  \ and I discuss the major stories of the day with our kids and answer any questions\
  \ they have. We're happy with the results so far. Both of our boys have advanced\
  \ vocabularies for their age and a great understanding of geography, government,\
  \ and important community issues such as access to affordable housing. To be clear,\
  \ they are allowed to watch other things like cartoons, age-appropriate NetFlix\
  \ shows/YouTube videos, etc. as well after their homework and chores are done for\
  \ the day. \n\nLately, our oldest son has been starting to push back and complain\
  \ that watching the news every day is boring/annoying and that none of his friends'\
  \ parents make them watch it. My mom has also expressed concerns that the boys are\
  \ too young to be hearing about \"scary\" topics like the conflict in Syria and\
  \ is worried we're going to give them anxiety over things that are out of their\
  \ control. She thinks we should just let them be kids for another few years. AITA?"
