selftext: "My(30m) wife (23f) is pregnant with twins and has overall had a pretty\
  \ easy pregnancy. No swelling, no diabetes, no complications, no fatigue etc. If\
  \ she didn\u2019t look like she swallowed a watermelon, no one would even know she\
  \ was pregnant. Her one complication is that she can get \u201Cmorning sickness\u201D\
  \ at almost any time. It doesn\u2019t last all day, but when it does happen it\u2019\
  s pretty intense, but usually subsided within 10 - 30min. Normally she just throws\
  \ up, comes out, and resumes what she\u2019s doing with no coddling or input from\
  \ me. I ask if she\u2019s alright, and sometimes offer water but usually she\u2019\
  s fine pretty quickly afterwards. This past weekend, I had a friend over and we\
  \ were playing the game when my wife got sick. She closed the door to the bathroom\
  \ and we could still hear her, so I turned the tv up a bit so I could hear. After\
  \ a while, she came out of the bathroom, went into our room, and shut the door.\n\
  \nSoon after, my phone started to vibrate with texts from my wife. She told me it\
  \ hurt her feelings that I don\u2019t comfort her when she\u2019s sick, and didn\u2019\
  t come check on her. I told her I didn\u2019t know she wanted me to, and if she\
  \ did she should have told me, I can\u2019t just read her mind and guess what she\
  \ wants. Plus I thought her closing the door was a nonverbal sign she wanted to\
  \ be left alone. She sent me a picture of her face, crying, and apparently she\u2019\
  d thrown up so hard a blood vessel in her face had popped, and looked really bad.\
  \ I asked if she wanted me to come now, and she said no, she didn\u2019t want to\
  \ have to tell me to take care of her, she just wanted me to do it. I told my friend\
  \ he\u2019d probably have to leave soon because my wife was upset, and he thinks\
  \ I didn\u2019t do anything while my wife thinks I\u2019m an asshole and still seems\
  \ upset with me. AITA?"
