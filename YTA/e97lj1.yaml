selftext: "Getting married early next year. It's going to be a small wedding on a\
  \ small budget as we both recently graduated. We've called in lots of favors. One\
  \ of our friends in a chef and he'll be smoking a pig and making sides for cost.\
  \ Friends and family are helping us decorate. It's hosted at a family friend's farm.\
  \ And one of our friends is a professional photographer (let's call him John) who\
  \ volunteered his time to shoot.\n\nAnyway. One of my friends who got married last\
  \ year did a boudoir shoot for their husband and she said he loved it. So I figured\
  \ I'd do the same for my husband. I called the photographer that did the shoot for\
  \ my friend and they were charging like $800 for the time + editing + prints. More\
  \ than we wanted to spend. So I asked our photographer friend if he'd be willing\
  \ to do it as well. He said sure. But, he did say that he has only done it once\
  \ before. So one weekend we do the shoot with a few different outfits. I think it\
  \ goes great.\n\nI show my fianc\xE9 a *teaser* image from the shoot (me in a nightie)\
  \ and he starts asking questions (about costs/who did it/etc). I tell him it was\
  \ free and John did the shoot. He gets upset that \"I allowed John to see me like\
  \ that.\" I basically reply that he's a professional and has done them before.\n\
  \nAITA or is my fianc\xE9 over reacting?\n\nedit:\n\nMost of the shots are in lingerie\
  \ but some are a bit more revealing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit 2:\n\nI accept my judgement.\
  \ If someone wants to give me advice on fixing it pm or chat but im turning off\
  \ replies."
