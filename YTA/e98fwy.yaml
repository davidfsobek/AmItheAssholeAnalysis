selftext: "So the other day, during a great evening with my wife it came up somehow\
  \ in conversation that I had a lap dance at my bachelor party that involved touching\
  \ the strippers breasts. My wife was distraught and it ruined the night. She claims\
  \ to not have known what a lap dance was and that I should have explained the details,\
  \ knowing she was against any touching.\n\nWe are 5 years married and she is very\
  \ upset. What you think? AITA?\n\nQuick edit - I live in Ontario near the Quebec\
  \ border, the club is in Quebec and it is very customary and normal to touch the\
  \ strippers breast while she is on your lap. It would almost be rude and laughable\
  \ if you did not.\n\nLast edit - thanks everyone for your thoughts. I already felt\
  \ like an asshole and apologized for what happened. She says she understands and\
  \ should have asked more about what happens at a strip club. I still feel bad I\
  \ guess, that\u2019s why I was curious what you all had to say. Around here my bachelor\
  \ party was the tamest I\u2019ve ever been to. Back then I cared more about what\
  \ people think of me. I wouldn\u2019t have done the same now.\n\nCheers!"
