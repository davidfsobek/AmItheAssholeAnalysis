selftext: "So I had a nonstop flight yesterday from LA to DC, a little under five\
  \ hours total. I was sitting in the middle seat in a row on the right side of the\
  \ plane, and the girl in the window seat was wearing all black and was clearly either\
  \ going directly to or from a funeral. She looked like she was maybe 12 or 13. I\
  \ don't know why she was traveling alone, I didn't ask.\n\nShe was crying quietly\
  \ the entire flight. She wasn't being loud or anything, but it was still very distracting\
  \ and stressful. She tried to engage me in conversation several times when I glanced\
  \ at her but I pretended I was absorbed in playing a game on my phone and that I\
  \ didn't hear her. I'm not good at situations like this and I thought I might make\
  \ things worse if I said something wrong. About halfway through the flight, I put\
  \ in headphones and listened to music on my phone because it was stressing me out\
  \ too much. Someone in one of the other rows must have flagged over a flight attendant\
  \ at some point, because one of them came over to talk to her a little later, and\
  \ she seemed like she was doing a little better after that, even though she was\
  \ still crying. \n\nI told my girlfriend about it when she picked me up from the\
  \ airport, and she acted like I was the biggest jerk in the world. She said this\
  \ was probably the worst day of that girl's life and I should have at least said\
  \ something nice to her. AITA?"
