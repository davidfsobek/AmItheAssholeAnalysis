selftext: "Getting married early next year. Invitations just went out, but a lot of\
  \ people from work fell on the \u201CB\u201D list because we both have big families\
  \ who live out of town who get first priority. A very small number of work friends\
  \ have been invited already. Once we get \u201Cno\u201D RSVPs from people out of\
  \ town, we\u2019ll replace those spots with work friends. \n\nGoing to a Christmas\
  \ party at someone\u2019s home with a lot of these work friends this weekend, where\
  \ there will be a White Elephant gift exchange. WIBTA if I brought an invitation\
  \ to my wedding as my white elephant gift? \n\nI can see it either as a cute way\
  \ to invite someone at an earlier stage... or it could highlight that some people\
  \ haven\u2019t been invited, make people feel like they have to beg and dance for\
  \ an invite, and make people feel way worse if they don\u2019t make the final cut."
