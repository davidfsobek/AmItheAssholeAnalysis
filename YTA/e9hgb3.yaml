selftext: "This happened a few months ago. I just learned about this subreddit and\
  \ thought this would be a good place to ask about a point of contention in the family.\
  \ \n\nMy daughter is overweight. Not anything too drastic, but she is around 5\u2019\
  4 and 155 pounds. So she could stand to lose a few pounds. I\u2019ve been concerned\
  \ about her weight for a long time. None of it has been helped by my also-overweight,\
  \ enabling wife.\n\nOn her 19th birthday, in August, we went on a hike in the state\
  \ forest. She complained about it literally the entire time. She didn\u2019t like\
  \ that it was hot, she didn\u2019t like the incline, she didn\u2019t like the mosquitoes.\
  \ I still encouraged her and pushed on, I think she was satisfied with having exercised\
  \ at the end of it. But, while we were driving back home, she knew that we would\
  \ be driving past a Dunkin Donuts. She wanted me to stop so she could get herself\
  \ a \u201Cbirthday donut.\u201D I said no. She was upset about it, saying she just\
  \ wanted a donut and she\u2019d just done this long hike to please me on her birthday.\
  \ I argued calmly that she didn\u2019t want to undo all the work of the hike by\
  \ getting a donut. She said the one she wanted is 350 calories (which I doubt is\
  \ true) and would fit into her day. I pointed out she\u2019d probably be eating\
  \ cake later. We didn\u2019t stop and she sulked about it on the whole ride back.\
  \ When we got home, she told her mother, who of course sided with her and went on\
  \ a rant about how our daughter\u2019s birthday shouldn\u2019t be a time I\u2019\
  m preaching healthy eating. \n\nI am trying to protect her health at every turn,\
  \ when she spends most of her free time with her mother. Am I really the asshole\
  \ for not wanting to stop and get her a fatty donut after a nice hike?"
