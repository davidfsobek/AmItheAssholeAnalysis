selftext: "I\u2019m visiting my girlfriend\u2019s family for the first time and they\u2019\
  re kind of rich.\n\nThey have a maid who comes and tidies up for a bit every day.\
  \ \n\nMy family isn\u2019t broke, but we\u2019ve never had people working for us,\
  \ and it made me super uncomfortable. Like, who am I to have someone serving me\
  \ and cleaning around me while I sit there? I can\u2019t imagine if my mom were\
  \ witnessing that. She\u2019d flip. \n\nSo I got up and started to help her tidy\
  \ up. She thanked me for the help and told me I really didn\u2019t have to worry\
  \ about it, but I told her it was no trouble (it really wasn\u2019t, we were just\
  \ sitting watching TV.) \n\nLater that night my girlfriend\u2019s parents asked\
  \ me not to help the maid clean because it was a boundary thing and her work was\
  \ her work and guests are guests. I told them it made me really uncomfortable to\
  \ have someone clean around me and they just said not to worry because she\u2019\
  s paid well and has been with them a long time. \n\nThe next day it happened again\
  \ and it made me so uncomfortable I said \u201Chey let\u2019s go outside\u201D to\
  \ my girlfriend but she was busy on her laptop. So eventually I couldn\u2019t help\
  \ it, I had to jump up and help her out. \n\nHer parents walked in and looked pissed\
  \ and my girlfriend finally clued in and ushered me outside. \n\nI\u2019m still\
  \ so confused by the situation. I\u2019m not sure if I was in the wrong for helping\
  \ her clean or if I\u2019m in the wrong now for not helping her. \n\nMy instinct\
  \ is to help, but when I do people get pissed, so, if you understand the dynamic\
  \ better than me, please clear this up. \n\nAm I the asshole for helping her clean?"
