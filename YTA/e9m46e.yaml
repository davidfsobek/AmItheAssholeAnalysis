selftext: "EDIT: thank you all for the feedback. I do feel like TA and will try to\
  \ do better as a step parent. Navigating the step parent role has been a lot harder\
  \ than I expected and I do make mistakes, but I don't ever want my stepson to feel\
  \ he is not loved or part of our family.\n\nMy in-laws will be visiting us in March\
  \ next year. They're coming from another country and it will be the first time they\
  \ meet the new baby. I've decided to put off the photoshoot until then and surprise\
  \ them with a big family photoshoot so grandma and grandpa can be in the photos\
  \ with their 2 grandsons.\n\n...\n\nThrowaway and mobile.\n\nI (30F) have a 4 month\
  \ old son with my husband (34M). My husband and I have been married for 4 years\
  \ and he has a 14 year old son from a previous marriage. The son lives with us 50%\
  \ of the time and 50% with his mom.\n\nWe tried for quite some time to have a baby\
  \ and I had a miscarriage before getting pregnant with my son. My little baby is\
  \ very much wanted and loved and to celebrate our new addition, I would like to\
  \ arrange for some professional photographs to be taken of me, my husband and the\
  \ baby as a family. My son is at that age where he is really starting to interact\
  \ with the world around him and I want to capture photos of him before he gets too\
  \ big.\n\nMy husband's other son is a typical teen boy and is not particularly interested\
  \ in the new baby, nor does he really show much interest in engaging with us as\
  \ parents / step parents at the moment - not sure if it's an age thing? We try to\
  \ get him interested in interacting with us but he's more interested in his iPad\
  \ tbh, and that's ok. My stepson and I are pleasant to one another but there isn't\
  \ that loving bond he has with his mom or dad.\n\nWIBTA if I organized for professional\
  \ photos to be taken of just the 3 of us (myself, my husband and my new baby) and\
  \ didn't include my stepson in our newborn family portrait? I've spoken to my husband\
  \ about it and he says it would be OK but I'd appreciate some external input. \n\
  \nPartly I think that if my husband wanted professional photos of his other son,\
  \ he is welcome to organize them himself, but since the task of arranging family\
  \ admin always falls to me, I don't want to include the stepson, because I don't\
  \ think he'd enjoy being a part of it."
