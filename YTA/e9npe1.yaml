selftext: "Yesterday, as I was leaving the store an employee with a scan gun asked\
  \ me to stop to \u201Cverify your purchase.\u201D I\u2019ve dealt with this before\
  \ and always allowed them to check my receipt, but it always felt like I was being\
  \ patted down or under suspicion when I didn\u2019t do anything and I just hate\
  \ that feeling. I did have a few items that weren\u2019t bagged but I didn\u2019\
  t want to deal with that suspect feeling today, so when he asked I played dumb and\
  \ responded \u201CWhy?\u201D\n\n\u201CTo... verify your purchase.\u201D\n\nI stared\
  \ at him for a moment and quietly said \u201CNo?\u201D and he just continued to\
  \ stare back at me. So I said louder \u201CNo, thank you,\u201D and started to make\
  \ my way toward the door. He didn\u2019t say anything as I left but he was still\
  \ looking at me when I went into the parking lot. All the way to my car I was wondering\
  \ if I was going to be stopped by loss prevention which made me hustle, but I felt\
  \ even more suspicious so I slowed down again. While loading my things into the\
  \ car I was thinking that I probably felt more suspect than if I just said yes to\
  \ the employee. That aside, I\u2019m wondering now if I was just being a jerk. So\
  \ I\u2019ll ask you, AITA?\n\nEdit to clarify:\nThis wasn\u2019t a member-type store.\
  \ I signed and paid nothing to allow me to shop there.\n\nAlso \u201CWhy?\u201D\
  \ and \u201CNo?\u201D weren\u2019t asked with any type of sarcastic tone. I wasn\u2019\
  t sure if I was allowed to decline, which is why I was asking."
