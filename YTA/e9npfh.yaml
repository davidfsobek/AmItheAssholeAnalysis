selftext: 'My 7yo asked me why his grandpa is so slow and I tell him it''s because
  he''s an older person and they are not as fast as younger people. Sometimes I pick
  up my 7yo boy from school and like most 7yo boys, he''s easily distracted. When
  he''s not moving fast enough I jokingly tell him "come on grandpa!" It''s an inside
  joke. For reasons unknown to me, one of the school employees (the librarian) said
  something to the effect "isn''t his name Alex?" It wasn''t a serious or funny question.
  It was passive-aggressive and corrective. I asked her if she knows why I call him
  that and she said "no, but we don''t like nicknames and -" and I cut her off and
  told her to "STFU then."

  EDIT: I didn''t say "shut the fuck up" I said "STFU." She knew what I meant.'
