selftext: "Hi I\u2019m 15, and male. I have my own bathroom in my house and the toilet\
  \ has a little logo on it that says Bemis. Nobody uses the toilet except for me\
  \ so I erased parts of the B and M to say Penis. My mom saw it and was really upset\
  \ but I told her I\u2019m the only one who uses that bathroom so it\u2019s no different\
  \ than me putting up posters in my room (which she\u2019s fine with.)  Is she being\
  \ unreasonable by asking me to remove the rest of the logo so it says nothing? I\
  \ really want it to continue to say penis."
