selftext: "This is more of a lighthearted post than most, but my daughter and I have\
  \ a $10 bet riding on who is the asshole here so it\u2019s incredibly important\
  \ to us. \n\nMy daughter bought a gorgeous little asshole into the house despite\
  \ me specifically telling her NO DOGS ALLOWED. She\u2019s moved in with my wife\
  \ and I as she\u2019s saving up $$ to buy her own place and we aren\u2019t charging\
  \ her rent. Her and my wife went ahead and picked up a German shepherd puppy and\
  \ she\u2019s just about the sweetest thing. \n\nNow when I was growing up if there\
  \ was ever a family dog bought home, that dog anybody had dibs on. If you made the\
  \ dog like you the most, well, that was your win, and if someone else didn\u2019\
  t like that they just had to try harder. \n\nMy daughter and my wife work together\
  \ in their yoga studio, myself I take homegrown produce and sell it down at market\
  \ so I have to take the truck out often.  I\u2019ve begun bribing the pup into my\
  \ truck with treats. \n\nMy daughter thinks I\u2019m \u2018stealing\u2019 her pup\
  \ and that I\u2019m an asshole for making the puppy like me more. As far as I\u2019\
  m concerned she could take the pup to work as the studio is owned by myself and\
  \ my wife, no one is stopping her. However she chooses not to. \n\nMy wife is wisely\
  \ staying out of this one. AITA here?"
