  \ turned out to be a real whiner/jerk.  I asked him to go get coffee one day so\
  \ we could get to know each other better. So basically we went on a date and he\
  \ was telling me all this personal shit that I did not want to hear about. He told\
  \ me about some of his exes and about how he hates his siblings. I was really pissed\
  \ off and said dude, this is a first date, I\u2019m not your therapist. I don\u2019\
  t care about you at all\u201D. He got pissed and said you \u201Cwanted to me know\
  \ me better, so why are you getting pissy when I\u2019m giving something you asked.\
  \ \n\nThings were getting pretty heated at that point and he left since people were\
  \ starting to look. I texted him the next day saying that he never would get any\
  \ girls in his life after his behavior on the date. He said he didn\u2019t want\
  \ to hear from me anymore and if I ever contacted him again outside work he would\
  \ contact the police and file harassment charges."
