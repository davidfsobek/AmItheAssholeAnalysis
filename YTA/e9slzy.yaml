selftext: "My boyfriend and I have been dating for 6 months. He\u2019s much more outgoing\
  \ and charismatic than me, he\u2019s the guy that walks into a party knowing no\
  \ one and walks out with the richest guy there inviting him to a beach or something.\
  \ He works in sales so I guess it makes sense.\n\nFor me it takes much more time\
  \ to get to know people and I only have a few close friends.\n\nI was having him\
  \ meet my friends for the first time last night. We went out for drinks. My friends\
  \ all introduced themselves they started talking. They did the usual introductory\
  \ \u201Cwhere do you work\u201D etc. he started telling a story about work and all\
  \ three of my friends were charmed by him. The rest of the night my friends only\
  \ would talk to him and didn\u2019t pay any attention to me. \n\nHe brought me up\
  \ in a few parts of the conversation but my friends quickly shifted the topic back\
  \ to him.\n\nAfter we got home I was upset and asked him when he is with me to try\
  \ and be less outgoing so I get a chance to talk. He said that he thought the goal\
  \ of meeting my friends was to make them like me and that he tried to include me\
  \ but they shut him down.\n\nHe\u2019s saying that he\u2019s not going to change\
  \ who he is when around me, but I think he should just be more sensitive to my needs.\n\
  \nAITA?"
