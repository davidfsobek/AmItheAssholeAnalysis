selftext: "Our 10 year old special needs son who has social communication issues was\
  \ given a \"C\" in a class based on his lack of participation in group projects.\
  \ \n\nI think he should be graded based on what he is capable of achieving (e.g.\
  \ his knowledge of the material rather than his success in a group OR a set of modified\
  \ expectations for his performance on group projects). My husband thinks he should\
  \ be graded with the same expectations as the rest of the class.\n\nFor context,\
  \ he is in a charter elementary school and has had an IEP for 3 years.  He is diagnosed\
  \ with ADHD and a writing disability. He has extensive problems socializing.  He\
  \ has good social cognition and a few good friends, but he has trouble engaging\
  \ socially at school. He spends most of the day by himself, including at lunch.\
  \ He is in two pull-out replacement special education classes (English and Math)\
  \ and is in the general education class for science and social studies.  This is\
  \ the first year grades have been given. He received A's in his special ed classes\
  \ and a C in the general education classes because of his lack of participation\
  \ in group projects."
title: AITA for thinking that my son should be graded differently because he has special
  needs?
