selftext: "I went to see Endgame with two of my friends. We are all in our thirties,\
  \ and are big Marvel fans. We where lucky enough to find some decent tickets in\
  \ deacent seats in the cinema, so we could go earlier than we had anticipated. If\
  \ it hadn't been for those seated tickets, we would have rather waited to see the\
  \ movie, than to see it in shitty seats. We love sitting in the middle of the middle\
  \ of a cinema.\n\nAfter we sat down, a group of 18 and 19 year olds came to our\
  \ row. They asked us if we could hop one seat over, so that they could sit with\
  \ their friend. They had bought five seats, with one of the seats being to our right,\
  \ and the rest to our left. That would entail their one friend sitting alone during\
  \ the whole movie. \n\nWe thought about it, and even though we would have wanted\
  \ to be nice about it, we didn't want to. We had been talking at great lenghts about\
  \ how lucky, and happy, we where about the seats.\n\n\"It's just one seat, so that\
  \ he doesn't sit totally alone. It would be a nice thing to do.\"   \n\"Yeah, but\
  \ we are very happy with our seats, I am sorry\".  \n\"He will be sitting all alone\"\
  \  \n\"Yes, but if you bought your tickets earlier he wouldn't have to...\"  \n\"\
  ...true\".\n\nThey weren't mean about it, so that's good. But I still feel a little\
  \ assholeish. Am I?\n\nPs: Their tickets are also prebought. They knew their seatings\
  \ before they bought them, and before they came to the cinema.\n\nEdit: Alright,\
  \ the verdict is in. I am, with me friends, assholes.\nI'll give it an extra thought\
  \ if I am in this kind of situation again \U0001F60A.\nNext AITA : am I the asshole\
  \ for throwing popcorn on people using the phone while in the movies?\nVerdict :\
  \ No, stop using your cellphones while in the cinema you inconsiderate, entitled\
  \ assholes!\n\nThank you for your verdicts!"
