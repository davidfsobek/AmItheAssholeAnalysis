  s 19 as well, that I met through some mutual friends. Well she came over around\
  \ 9:30, we had a good time together, then at about 11, I was getting tired so we\
  \ decided it was time for her to head out. She had about a mile commute home. We\
  \ were talking and I mentioned her taking an uber and she said her card wasn\u2019\
  t working with Uber and she only had cash so she couldn\u2019t. I haven\u2019t known\
  \ her for long so I didn\u2019t take it as my responsibility to pay for her Uber.\
  \ So in the end she walked home. Some people were telling me that I was a douche\
  \ for having her walk home, but I didn\u2019t think so. AITA?"
