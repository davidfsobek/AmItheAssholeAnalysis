selftext: "My ex wife is extremely dramatic, overbearing and manipulative. She loves\
  \ to have her way. She has primary custody of our 7 year old who she is convinced\
  \ needs a therapist because he has been acting out in school. So she enrolled him\
  \ with one who also does family therapy. \n\nThat therapist has since diagnosed\
  \ him with anxiety. \n\nI keep getting invites from my ex to go to their family\
  \ therapy sessions. He does his own individually once a week. Family is once a month.\
  \ I am refusing to go. One because the times are always super inconvenient.\nThey\
  \ meet at his school (this is a school based therapy so he doesn\u2019t miss school).\
  \ Two because my wife is convinced that my lack of a good relationship with him\
  \ is part of the issue. \n\nTogether they have apparently and my son has separately\
  \ told the therapist that I say mean things to him (I just don\u2019t baby him)\
  \ and that I never see him (not true). I admit I could spend more time with him\
  \ but being able to always be there is hard. I make it when I can and I communicate\
  \ with him when I can\u2019t. \n\nA year ago she was feeling overwhelmed  after\
  \ a \u201Cmedical thing\u201D (she claimed she almost died from cancer but it was\
  \ really a simple surgery) and cried to me about taking him for a while. I couldn\u2019\
  t. She threatened to drop him off at my parents and run away.  She has since claimed\
  \ to have worked through it with her own therapist and talked through it with our\
  \ son apologizing for \u201Cmommy having a tough time\u201D. \n\nI asked the therapist\
  \ on the phone if my son talked about me and she said \u201CYes, sometimes\u201D\
  \ Then she asked me to come in for the next session but I was working that day.\
  \ \n\n\nI think a huge issue is her having tried to abandon him and generally just\
  \ being who she is which is an awful person and my son picks up on that. \n\nI have\
  \ told her flat out I am not going to those appointments. I have ignored the emails\
  \ from the therapist. \n\nI am walking into a room already primed to consider me\
  \ at fault and I don\u2019t think I need to be there for that. Why? So she can say\
  \ \u201Csee who agrees with me\u201D and be smug about it. \n\nShe said she talked\
  \ to a lawyer and she could take it to court to get it ordered and I told her to\
  \ go ahead but I will fight to choose the therapist, not someone already on her\
  \ side. I am sure she has bought all my exes lies and my son\u2019s exaggerations\
  \ that are fed and created by my ex. \n\nAITA for not going to family therapy when\
  \ clearly it is meant to attack or belittle me?"
