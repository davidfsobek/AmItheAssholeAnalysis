selftext: 'Hi all. I''m a high school English teacher and teach grades 10 through
  12. This incident happened today and I keep thinking about it so I want to get it
  out before I spend the weekend dwelling.




  So I have a policy of closing my classroom door 3 minutes after class begins to
  give a fair amount of time for stragglers to show up, then after that they have
  to knock and wait in the hall for me to let them in after hearing their excuse.



  One of my grade 10s, I''ll call her Emma, has fallen victim to the closed door a
  number of times including today. We start every class with 10 minutes of quiet reading
  and she knocked after 5 had passed. I went to the hall to ask her why she was late
  again and she told me she had her period and had to deal with it. Note that classes
  have 10 minute intervals between them so she had time to get to the bathroom and
  do her business.



  I said to her, "Then if you haven''t already, you should see your doctor, because
  you had your period two weeks ago when you used this same excuse." She just looked
  taken aback and didn''t reply, but I let her in the room where she went and immediately
  began to whisper to her friend sat next to her, presumably about what I had just
  said, as they were staring incredulously over at me. Emma didnt speak or contribute
  for the rest of class.



  I knew it was two weeks ago because it was the day of our Holiday assembly which
  I escorted the class to. That was the only reason I had this in my mind, I''m not
  keeping track of any periods on purpose.




  I''ve been mulling the situation over in my head and feel now I may have crossed
  a line by accident though it wasn''t my intention to make Emma uncomfortable.



  I havent heard anything else about the situation but I feel I may have overstepped.
  On one hand, I don''t want Emma to feel like she can pull a fast one on me with
  the period excuse every time. On the other, if she is experiencing irregularities
  or something, then she probably DOES need to see a doctor. So AITA for pointing
  out this to my student?





  Edit: After reading the majority of responses I realize that even if it was an excuse,
  I should not have said what I did. I do want to reiterate to those accusing me of
  being creepy that I am not keeping track of anything, I simply remembered because
  the other date she used the excuse was a memorable one.



  I also want to quickly comment on my closed door policy as it seems to have struck
  a chord with many. Clearly schools are different everywhere, because this is something
  many teachers do at my school as they did when I was growing up. It is not a power
  trip, it is a means of teaching the consequences of certain actions and encourages
  effective time management. I do not turn anyone away once they arrive, and this
  is not a policy I will be changing in spite of the backlash that I have recieved.
  I thank you all for your replies and opinions.



  EDIT: I would just like to reiterate again that I am asking about the situation
  involving myself and the student, not if I am an asshole for closing my classroom
  door. This is a policy many teachers follow and it is not a "power trip" or a "show
  of dominance". If I wanted to know if I was an asshole for closing my classroom
  door, thats what I would have asked about.'
