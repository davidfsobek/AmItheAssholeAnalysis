selftext: "I run a small company. One of my friends works for me and has a senior\
  \ position (as senior as you can be at a small company). \n\nHe and I go to lunch\
  \ regularly. Sometimes he picks up the check, sometimes I do. We always end up talking\
  \ about business for a good chuck of lunch, though we are personal friends as well.\
  \ \n\nToday I asked the server for the itemized receipt so I could expense the lunch.\
  \ My friend/employee asked, \u201Cyou expense these?\u201D.\n\nI told my girlfriend\
  \ this story and she reacted very negatively. She said I should either pick up the\
  \ check every time and expense, instruct my employee to expense when he picks it\
  \ up, or neither of us should expense every time. She thinks it is unfair for him\
  \ to pay out of pocket and me to pay with the company\u2019s money. \n\nAs a founder\
  \ of the company I think it\u2019s perfectly reasonable of me to use my discretion\
  \ about when a lunch can be expensed, and I\u2019m not doing anything wrong by letting\
  \ my friend/colleague pick up the tab. \n\nAITA for letting him pick up the tab,\
  \ and expensing it when I pick it up?"
