selftext: 'At my fast food place I manage I have an employee, "Hal" who''s been a
  bit of problem but not enough of one to fire him. We have side-work and cleaning
  tasks we do once our morning rush ends to prepare the joint for nightshift. There
  are easy tasks everyone fights over and hard tasks no one wants. I have side-work
  of my own that only the manager can do so I allow my employees to delegate amongst
  themselves since they''re the ones doing the tasks. That said, I''d never ask them
  to do a task I, myself have not done or wouldn''t do if the need arose. I keep a
  white-board up by the employee sink where everyone initials by which task they did.
  It''s all about fairness and lately I''ve noticed Hal will rush to do the easy stuff
  and sign his name then sit back and watch his coworkers do the harder tasks without
  helping. Hal works the 5am-12pm shift and once we''re slow I have to start letting
  people leave otherwise I''m losing money so Hal typically ends up leaving when he''s
  finished. I admit to being remiss while doing my own work but that''s all changing.


  I took a couple days, reviewed the camera footage, talked to my employees, let them
  vent, apologized for not noticing sooner, and then come up with a way to fairly
  punish Hal. It''s just sort of sucky because while he''s being a jerk to his coworkers
  he''s technically doing his job so I had to find an accurate way to punish without
  going too far.


  Day before yesterday I called everyone together when the rush ended and pretended
  to scold everyone but Hal, then I praised Hal for being so efficient and thorough
  with his side-tasks and said that since he was the only one willing to work then
  maybe he wouldn''t mind doing all of the side-work since he''s the only one I can
  trust. I think he realized he had been caught out but he didn''t say anything and
  he did the work. My other employees I gave very easy tasks like wiping down the
  counters, or helping me count the tips, and they all ended being able to leave early
  or on-time while Hal stayed until I let him go: exactly at the time which he was
  scheduled to leave and not a moment later or sooner.


  All yesterday Hal was very, very passive aggressively quiet and broody. He wouldn''t
  speak to me at all unless I asked him a direct question and barely spoke to his
  coworkers. When he did his side-work he did bathrooms and trash, two of the least-liked
  tasks, finished them early and efficiently and was able to leave about twenty minutes
  early. But I could tell he was very upset.


  But now I''m beginning to worry, was this punishment too much? Should I have just
  given him a lecture and warning? Was I an asshole?'
