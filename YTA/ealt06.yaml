selftext: "I recently took some of my older daughter\u2019s (we\u2019ll call her M)\
  \ old toys out from storage to let my younger daughter (we\u2019ll call her V) play\
  \ with them. V was pretty excited to have some new toys to play with, and it\u2019\
  s been so long since M has even looked at any of it, so I didn\u2019t think it would\
  \ be a big deal. But then M came home from school and saw V playing with one particular\
  \ toy, and she told me that she didn\u2019t want V playing with it because it was\
  \ special because her mom gave it to her. I had honestly forgotten that her mom\
  \ had given her this toy, as she was out of the picture for most of M\u2019s life,\
  \ and I did not realize how special it was to her, but I obviously understood that\
  \ M didn\u2019t want V ruining it so I got it back and told M to put it in her room.\
  \ And that\u2019s when M started to get angrier about the situation, saying that\
  \ I should never have touched her stuff without asking her, and instead of taking\
  \ the one toy to her room, she packed up the entire box (including some of V\u2019\
  s new toys; M wasn\u2019t even sure what was in the original box) and brought it\
  \ all up to her room. V cried at first when the toys were gone but quickly got distracted\
  \ by some of her other toys. I went to check on M, and she just left the box of\
  \ toys sit in the corner of the room, and she told me not to touch it. I understand\
  \ that the toys might be sentimental to M, but I thought it would be nice to let\
  \ V play with them instead of letting them all gather dust. AITA?"
