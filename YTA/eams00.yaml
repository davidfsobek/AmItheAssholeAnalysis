selftext: "So my birthday was on Thursday. I turned 21. My group of friends (there\u2019\
  s five of us) and I decided to drive to Las Vegas and have a good time to celebrate.\
  \ It\u2019s only a 3 hour drive from us. \n\nWe thought it would be cute and a good\
  \ way to keep up with each other if we wore matching outfits, so I offered to buy\
  \ them (since it is my party). \n\nNot sure if I should include the outfit, but\
  \ they were two piece crop top with matching skirt in a fun pattern. Now, one of\
  \ my girlfriends is a bigger girl (250-300 lbs). So I did not get her the same crop\
  \ top, but got her full length shirt, because I thought it would be more flattering.\n\
  \nNeedless to say she got really mad about it, and is threatening to cancel on us\
  \ ( we are supposed to be leaving today). I can\u2019t replace the shirt, because\
  \ I ordered it a while ago. And I\u2019m not sure if she just didn\u2019t notice,\
  \ but she didn\u2019t say anything about it until now. \n\nSome of my friends agree\
  \ with my choice, like what if she was embarrassed to wear a crop top? Some of them\
  \ think i was an asshole, and some of them even say I was being discriminatory,\
  \ which I just don\u2019t agree with. Am I an asshole for this? I really don\u2019\
  t think so, but would like some opinions."
