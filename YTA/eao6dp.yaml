selftext: "Daughter is 18, and will be going off to college soon. Before my Father\
  \ died, he left some money for her and her siblings to go to school or buy a house.\
  \ I have been adding to it ever since; for about ten years. \n\nMy daughter has\
  \ independently saved up quite a bit of money over the years, around 12k. Recently\
  \ in a discussion about her future, I asked her what she planned on doing with the\
  \ money. She was hesitant to tell me, but said that she planned on getting plastic\
  \ surgery. She said she wanted a BBL, or Brazilian butt lift. I have been hearing\
  \ about this surgery killing people. \n\nI told her she would absolutely not get\
  \ plastic surgery because she looked fine. She says it\u2019s her money and she\
  \ will do what she wants. So I told her if she goes through with it I will not be\
  \ paying for her college expenses. She is saying I can\u2019t go back on my word,\
  \ but just as she is going to be doing what she wants with her money, I can do what\
  \ I want with mine. \n\nMy wife agrees with me but my mother doesn\u2019t, because\
  \ part of the money was given by my father, even though the amount he gave will\
  \ barely cover a year for her. I don\u2019t want her to do something so vain and\
  \ stupid, but I also don\u2019t want to limit her future. AITA or is my daughter?"
