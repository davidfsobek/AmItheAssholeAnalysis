selftext: "Throwaway because people know me on my main account. \n\nAnyways I\u2019\
  m (26F) getting married next June and it\u2019s been a massive struggle with my\
  \ mom, step dad, dad, and step mom. \n\n Basically I don\u2019t have the best relationship\
  \ with my dad already. He cheated on my mom when I was 14 and later married his\
  \ mistress, who\u2019s my current  step mom although I don\u2019t call her any sort\
  \ of \u201Cmom.\u201D They have 3 kids together. \n\nOver the years my own siblings\
  \ have become really close to his kids but I haven\u2019t. So now that I\u2019m\
  \ getting married the initial pressure was on me to invite his entire family, despite\
  \ me not getting along with his wife at all. \n\nI decided along with my fianc\xE9\
  \ that we will only invite my dad, for my siblings sake, but his wife and kids will\
  \ not be invited to our wedding. This caused huge uproar with my siblings and eventually\
  \ I was FURTHER pressured to invite his kids, but only to the latter half of the\
  \ reception and not the ceremony (I stood my ground). I sent an email explaining\
  \ my logic and decision to the entire extended family, in case anyone was confused\
  \ why I did not want these people at my ceremony. \n\nAnyways, just last week my\
  \ dad calls me and says he won\u2019t be coming to my wedding after all after how\
  \ \u201Crude\u201D I\u2019ve been to his wife and kids and how my email supposedly\
  \ humiliated them. He says he\u2019ll be going on vacation with them that week and\
  \ will send his gift through mail instead. I told him if that\u2019s his choice\
  \ don\u2019t bother contacting me for the rest of his life because I won\u2019t\
  \ answer, because I\u2019m not letting him abandon me a second time. \n\nAITA for\
  \ this threat? My fianc\xE9 is fully on my side but my siblings have called me heartless.\
  \ Even my mom who\u2019s the sweetest person alive has questioned my tactics. Thanks."
