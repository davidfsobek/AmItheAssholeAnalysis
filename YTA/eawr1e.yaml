selftext: "Hey all. This may be a little silly. My new boyfriend recently hung up\
  \ two Christmas stockings with our first name initials on each. The thing is, I\
  \ know these stockings are from when he was dating his ex girlfriend as 1) our names\
  \ start with the same letter and 2) I\u2019ve seen pictures of these stockings from\
  \ when they were dating. Basically he is recycling Christmas stockings he and his\
  \ girlfriend shared in the past with me. WIBTA if I called him out on this? Thanks\
  \ in advance. \n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, they broke up 2.5 years ago."
