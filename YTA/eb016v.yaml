selftext: 'About six months ago I picked up a stray dog in the streets close to my
  current apartment. She tugged at my heartstrings and I took her in. The problem?
  The apartment doesn''t allow pets, so I''ve had to keep her a secret. But she''s
  been really well behaved and doesn''t do anything to give away her presence to the
  landlord. It helps that they''ve not once checked my apartment since I''ve had her.
  She''s now become my best friend.


  About 3 weeks ago a young woman moved in next door. I introduced myself and gave
  her some home baked cookies, she invited me in and we had a bit of tea and she revealed
  that she was a violinist for an amateur orchestra and string quartet in the city.
  Cool!


  She practices for about several hours every day usually in the evening. The first
  time she played my dog immediately started barking, and I tried to calm her down
  but I ended up having to make up an excuse and ask the neighbor to stop practicing
  (she did, to her credit). The next day I immediately went out and bought a muzzle
  before coming home. I didn''t want anyone to know there was a dog in my home. The
  muzzle has kept her barking in check but it hurts me knowing my dog has to wear
  it for hours every evening. I get home at 6PM after work so half the time I have
  after work is spent with my dog muzzled.


  I did some research and one of our local universities has music practice rooms,
  some of which can be rented out to non-students. I went next door to the neighbor
  and offered to rent out a room for her permanently and to ask her to practice there
  instead of at home. It''s only 10-15 minutes away from where we live, but she politely
  declined saying she''d rather practice in the comfort of her home.


  Now I''m at my wit''s end. WIBTA if I threatened to report her to management for
  noise unless she takes my offer? I feel like I''m being fair here, but I''d like
  reddit to tell me if I''m being unreasonable'
