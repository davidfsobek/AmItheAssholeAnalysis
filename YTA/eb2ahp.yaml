selftext: "Ok so I have been lying for about 3 months now; to my girlfriend about\
  \ working on Saturday so I can play video games all day; before I tried to explain\
  \ to her how big part of my life video games are but she just does not understand;\
  \ she comes everyday to my apartment after work ( schedule is 8 am to 5 pm ); she\
  \ will come around 6 pm dressed like a princess and ready for me to have a plan\
  \ for her night; movies; dinner; dance; ANYTHING that takes me out of my apartment/video-games;\
  \ we settle down on 2 days out 5 at home but I won the battle because I bring out\
  \ money to the table but to be honest I just wanted to be lazy at home; now on holidays\
  \ I cant have this lie going on anymore at least till January; I am really stressed\
  \ about this but I am sure the lie is saving the relationship.\n\n  \nOn her side\
  \ she tells me a lot that she comes to my place to have my attention and when I\
  \ play I just ignore her;  she likes to talk a lot; her sex drive is way bigger\
  \ than mine and after sex she wants me to stay there doing nothing for like and\
  \ hour ( for me this feels like wasting time I could use; even tv is not allowed\
  \ in this weird after sex time ) so I frequently try to avoid sex till late night\
  \ so I can sleep after sex;  I love her  trust me on this I DO LOVE HER but she\
  \ feels that I dont love her in the way she loves me ( for example she can just\
  \ sit and look at me for hours without getting bored and I just cant I really need\
  \ to be doing something )\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEnding note; If AITA ill stop lying and\
  \ have a confrontation with her about videogames ( again)   \nIf NTA  Ill find a\
  \ way to survive holidays and go back to 6 days work schedule per week on January"
