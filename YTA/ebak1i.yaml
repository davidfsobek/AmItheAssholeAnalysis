selftext: "This happened this past Saturday. I\u2019m currently staying in LA for\
  \ about a week while I sort something personal things out. A good buddy from college\
  \ offered me to stay with him and his fam. It\u2019s a good deal since I\u2019m\
  \ pretty strapped and a hotel room for a week would probably be close to a thousand\
  \ here. \n\nAnyways, around noon I was hungry and got some food delivered to the\
  \ house off a food app. My buddy happened to be out hiking with his gf but his parents\
  \ were home. I was upstairs in the guest room just watching tv. Apparently the doorbell\
  \ rung but I didn\u2019t hear anything until his dad appeared at my door with my\
  \ food. I just said thanks and took it and ate in my room. \n\nWell my buddy came\
  \ back on Sunday and kinda hinted at me being antisocial for doing that. He said\
  \ I should\u2019ve been downstairs but I told him I literally didn\u2019t hear the\
  \ doorbell. I get the feeling maybe his dad thought I was being a mooch but i ordered\
  \ food for myself with my own money. It\u2019s not like I was raiding their fridge.\
  \ But I admit I\u2019m sometimes clueless in social situations.\n\nAITA for getting\
  \ food delivered to my friend\u2019s house (while I\u2019m crashing there) and accidentally\
  \ having his dad bring it up to me in my room?"
