selftext: "A few months ago, my older sister opened up her home to me (I'm an adult\
  \ in my late-twenties) due to a bad housing situation (see update below). I took\
  \ over her older daughter's bedroom (she's 9 - but she sleeps with her little sister,\
  \ anyway, so it's pretty much a vacant/storage room). But anyway, most recently,\
  \ her younger, 7-year old daughter has taken a liking to telling me I \"don't live\
  \ here at this home\" and that \"this isn't your home.\" It all started because\
  \ she doesn't have clear sense of boundaries, so when I was studying for an interview,\
  \ asked her to leave the room (she barges in whenever she wants, refuses to leave,\
  \ etc.). When I told my sister, who subsequently talked to her, my niece said one\
  \ of her schoolmates dared her to say it to me (which absolutely makes no sense).\
  \ Regardless, my sister apologized, but blame it on said schoolmate.\n\nWell, it's\
  \ not stopping - my niece has since \"dared\" my nephew to tell me I don't belong\
  \ here and that this isn't my home. I've talked to my sister, and my niece blamed\
  \ it on the fact that I was \"bugging\" her while she was playing. These were at\
  \ different times in the day, not at all an excuse. My sister once again dismissed\
  \ it and said she was \"probably joking.\"\n\nI'm holding a bit of a grudge/frustration,\
  \ and I acknowledge it's petty considering the child is seven. But she's taken no\
  \ action or steps in reprimanding her daughter whatsoever.\n\nAlso, a side note\
  \ as it seems to be pretty important/a common theme in the comments: aside from\
  \ the frustration, I do not treat her or the rest of the family maliciously. I set\
  \ aside 'playtime' with them, bond with them, read with them, etc. Several of the\
  \ comments paint the picture of an ungrateful, unemployed adult milking off her\
  \ older sister when that is nowhere close to who I am as a sister or an aunt.\n\n\
  **UPDATE:**\n\nHey, everyone. So didn\u2019t really think this post would pick up\
  \ like this. I wanted to get a few words in before this post stops picking up traction.\n\
  \nThanks to everyone giving me their honest opinion. I do and fully recognize that\
  \ she\u2019s a 7-year-old baby, and my sister is doing me a tremendous favor by\
  \ letting me crash with her for the time being.\n\nFor anyone who has called me\
  \ lazy, pathetic, sad, etc. Please understand that I am also **HUMAN**. I had to\
  \ crash with her because I was moved back home to be with my ill dad (cancer), and\
  \ for whatever reason our house was targeted in a shooting and I was almost hit.\n\
  \nSo not having a place to stay, feeling lost and confused while also managing a\
  \ full-time overwhelming job has taken a toll. And hearing you don\u2019t belong\
  \ here when I did not, in fact, have a place to stay was disheartening. But again,\
  \ a child.\n\nThat is all. Doesn\u2019t change things, but this post helped me get\
  \ out of my bubble and realize she\u2019s a child."
