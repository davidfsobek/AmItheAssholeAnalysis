selftext: "My nephew is 15 months and to put it simply he loves to eat. He loves food.\
  \ \n\nWhenever anybody is eating something he\u2019ll walk up to them and try and\
  \ take some of their food. \n\nMe and my mum (his grandma) always give him a taste\
  \ of whatever we are eating so long as it\u2019s not spicy or a choking hazard.\n\
  \nToday after eating his lunch and a yoghurt and juice, he ate some of my mums food\
  \ and then like 30 minutes later he came towards me wanting some of my trifle so\
  \ I gave him a bit of it. Like 2/3 spoons. \n\nMy sister then opened a bag of crisps\
  \ and he wanted some of that too. \n\nShe refused to give him any and she was ignoring\
  \ his attempts. \n\nHe started to cry and my mum started being typical grandma and\
  \ gave him cuddles and \u201Cprotected\u201D him from mummy.\n\nMy sister had a\
  \ fit. She said he\u2019s getting too fat, he\u2019s eating too much. And that we\
  \ are all enabling his behaviour and that it needs to be nipped in the bud right\
  \ now. Before he does this in public.\n\nI told her he\u2019s only 15 months and\
  \ probably more curious about what everything is than hungry for food. I said she\
  \ was being ridiculous and that it\u2019s soemtbing he\u2019ll grow out of.\n\n\
  She told me she\u2019s the mum and what she says goes.\n\nI said to her she was\
  \ being harsh ridiculous as he is only a baby. \n\n\nSo AITA?"
