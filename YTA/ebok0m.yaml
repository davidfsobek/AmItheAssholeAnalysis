selftext: "My fianc\xE9\u2019s best friend/best man is planning a surprise bachelor\
  \ party for him. \n\nThe best man wrote me and asked for a list of the groomsmen\
  \ so he\u2019d make sure he invited everyone. \n\nMy younger brother is one of the\
  \ groomsmen and is a recovering alcoholic in his third month of sobriety, just back\
  \ to college after having to sit out a semester from the disease, and working very\
  \ hard to stay on track. \n\nHe and my fianc\xE9 are close and he\u2019s been looking\
  \ super forward to his first bachelor party, but decided he shouldn\u2019t attend\
  \ if it would be centered around drinking because he didn\u2019t feel he was ready\
  \ to handle being the only sober one in a group of drunk people. \n\nI found out\
  \ when talking about guest list and plans that the best man was basically planning\
  \ a night of poker and drinking games, so I asked him if he could do that some other\
  \ night with just my fianc\xE9 and their friends and make the bachelor party a dry\
  \ thing. \n\nHe was pissed and said he shouldn\u2019t have to plan two separate\
  \ events just to accommodate one person and that it wouldn\u2019t be a legit bachelor\
  \ party without booze. I told him if he wasn\u2019t up to the task, someone else\
  \ could plan it, because there had to be a dry party. \n\nNow that I\u2019ve had\
  \ some time to sit with it I\u2019m worrying it wasn\u2019t my place to insist on\
  \ this. I know my little brother would\u2019ve been really hurt to not go to the\
  \ bachelor party, but this isn\u2019t his wedding, it\u2019s my fianc\xE9\u2019\
  s, but I do want him to have a good time and not be excluded because of his sobriety.\
  \ \n\nI can\u2019t talk to anyone about it without spoiling the surprise. AITA?"
