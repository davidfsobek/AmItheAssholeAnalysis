selftext: "tl;dr: My brother, a lawyer who lives in an international Asian city, won\u2019\
  t stop wearing kilts on a casual basis. Our family hates it. We are not scottish.\
  \ \n\nAbout 2-3 years ago he and his wife got hooked on Outlander; a TV show set\
  \ in the Middle Ages in Scotland. They thought it would be funny to order kilts\
  \ and wear them, but my brother took a liking to his, bought more and has been wearing\
  \ them almost anytime he\u2019s not at work. What this means is that in every picture\
  \ we see of him and his family, he\u2019s wearing this (IMO) ridiculous kilt in\
  \ a sad attempt to be edgy and \u2018zany\u2019. Just FYI, he doesn\u2019t look\
  \ good in it.  He looks like a person with mental problems. \n\nHe gets stared at\
  \ all over town where he lives, and my own friends think it\u2019s bizarre. I\u2019\
  m concerned it\u2019s going to affect his life professionally (his coworkers/bosses\
  \ would probably not approve if they saw him in these outfits) and it will affect\
  \ the lives of his children (who are 1-5 years old) who will be in the \u2018eccentric\u2019\
  \ family. \n\nI\u2019ve checked with some close friends in the city I live in, they\
  \ think it\u2019s a stupid and possibly career-dangerous idea.\n\nI wish I could\
  \ post some pics with his face blurred out (and with his consent), not sure what\
  \ the rules are in this sub.\n\nEdit: so, I think it\u2019s pretty clear what the\
  \ result is, I\u2019m happy to accept it. Thanks everyone for your inputs. Our other\
  \ brother has suggested that I have to wear one of his kilts for a day because I\
  \ lost our bet. To be clear, we\u2019re all currently in a SE Asian country so guess\
  \ I get to find out what it\u2019s like to be stared at all day ;)\n\nEdit 2: yup,\
  \ looks like I\u2019m wearing a kilt for a day, lol"
