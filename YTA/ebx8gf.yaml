selftext: "\n\nMy wife and I are on vacation in Orlando Florida and needed a ride\
  \ to Denny\u2019s. I ordered the UBER and was matched with a man that arrived in\
  \ less than 2 minutes after we requested. When we sat down in the car he looked\
  \ back and asked if he could use the bathroom really fast, and we said it was fine.\
  \ Me and my wife looked at each other and agreed that it\u2019s fair that someone\
  \ should be allowed to use the bathroom if need be (obviously). He actually did\
  \ a slow jog into the resort we were staying at, turned around and returned to tell\
  \ us the rate wouldn\u2019t go up because of it. But as time went on I told my wife\
  \ there was no way I\u2019m giving this guy 5 stars, she thinks it\u2019s not fair\
  \ to the driver. The entire affair lasted 5 minutes or so. Why wouldn\u2019t he\
  \ use the bathroom before he accepted the ride? I hate rating Uber drivers with\
  \ low scores because it\u2019s their livelyhood but come on dude. AITA?\n\nTDLR\n\
  Friendly Uber driver picked my wife and I up and then left us in the car to use\
  \ the bathroom."
