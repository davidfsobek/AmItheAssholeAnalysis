selftext: "Last night I found out that my sister (32F) stole over 40K from our grandma.\
  \ She has been using her credit card for the last year, and then doctoring her billing\
  \ statements. Since my grandma doesn\u2019t use the Internet, she had no idea this\
  \ was happening. I feel like I have lost my sister forever. This level of betrayal\
  \ is unforgivable, and it has devastated our parents. My poor dad can\u2019t even\
  \ talk about grandma without tearing up. \n\nThey found out over a month ago, and\
  \ have been dealing with the aftermath in private since they are so embarrassed\
  \ and do not want the rest of the family to find out. My dad is getting a second\
  \ job to pay her back, since that was all of her savings and she had to dip into\
  \ her retirement. He is busy enough as it is, and I am so angry that he has to clean\
  \ up her mess yet again. My grandma is deciding whether she wants to press charges\
  \ or not, and honestly I think she should. Clearly she has a problem if she thinks\
  \ stealing that much from an elderly woman is ok, and she should pay for what she\
  \ did. \n\nSo my question is, WIBTA if I went against my parents wishes, and told\
  \ all of our family and friends what my sister has done? I want everyone to know\
  \ who she really is, so she can feel the severity of her actions. I knew she had\
  \ questionable morals, but thought she was a good person. This has rocked me to\
  \ my core, and I hate that our extended family is oblivious to the situation. I\
  \ am thinking to go to the family Christmas party this year and tell everyone what\
  \ a monster she is, but my mom has asked me not to and I want to respect her wishes.\
  \ If I do tell, I would appreciate advice on how to go about it as delicately as\
  \ possible.\n\nThings aren\u2019t always black and white, and she is still my sister\
  \ and has been there for me through a lot. She was in the room for the birth of\
  \ both my kids, and has been a second mother to my daughter. Doing this could ruin\
  \ our relationship forever. Right now I don\u2019t want anything to do with her,\
  \ but that could change in a few years. Also, I don\u2019t want to embarrass my\
  \ parents, and I know they are going to be mortified if I do. Everyone is going\
  \ to find out eventually though, and I think it is unfair to keep them in the dark\
  \ and let them get her Christmas presents. \n\nETA: My grandma wants to tell everyone,\
  \ but is trying to respect my parent\u2019s wishes and doesn\u2019t want to hurt\
  \ them. \n\nHer plan is to pay $1,000 a month, but that will take years which is\
  \ why we are trying to come up with ideas to get the money back to her sooner\n\n\
  She spent the money on frivolous things like vacations, clothes, nice home furnishings\
  \ and appliances, hotel rooms, bills, her cats, and to help pay her debt from filing\
  \ for bankruptcy years ago. There was absolutely no good reason for her to steal\
  \ the money. She has a full time job that pays well. \n\n2nd Edit: Wow, these comments\
  \ are divided! I will not tell my family around Christmas time, that would be unfair\
  \ to everyone. Ours is already ruined, I shouldn\u2019t do that to anyone else.\
  \ Other than that I still don\u2019t know what I should do, so keep voting. All\
  \ of the advice has made me feel less helpless, thank you everyone.\n\nTLDR: WIBTA\
  \ if I told our extended family that my sister stole 40K from my grandma, even though\
  \ it would make everyone hate her and embarrass my parents?"
title: WIBTA if I told everyone the terrible thing my sister did?
