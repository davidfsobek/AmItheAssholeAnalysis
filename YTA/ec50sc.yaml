selftext: "Son is 11, daughter is 14, both are Tae Kwon Do black belts. Last year\
  \ was my son\u2019s first year competing in this tournament, and he not only won\
  \ his match, he was given a special award by his instructor for being the best in\
  \ the show. We were obviously very proud of him and took him out to dinner. My daughter\
  \ did not compete last year as she had a school trip.\n\nThis year my daughter was\
  \ paired with a boy who was smaller than her and a lower belt rank. Of course she\
  \ won easily. We waited and waited for my son\u2019s name to be called, but it never\
  \ was. Eventually I spoke to the instructor who said there had been an error and\
  \ my son wasn\u2019t on the list of competitors. In order to give him a chance to\
  \ compete, he was paired with one of the assistant instructors. Naturally he lost\
  \ as he is an 11 year old boy.\n\nHe is a sensitive kid and was visibly upset about\
  \ losing especially after doing so well last year, so we went out to his favorite\
  \ place and made it all about him. I stressed how important it is to lose gracefully\
  \ and how brave he was to be put up against odds like he was and try his hardest\
  \ anyway. I also congratulated my daughter for winning her match, but didn\u2019\
  t go overboard because it was easy for her and nothing she hasn\u2019t done before.\
  \ I also didn\u2019t want my son to feel worse hearing how proud I was of his sister\
  \ (he already feels somewhat competitive with her).\n\nWell, now my daughter is\
  \ pissed that I supposedly didn\u2019t care about her win. She thinks it isn\u2019\
  t fair that her brother was celebrated when he won last year and she isn\u2019t.\
  \ I don\u2019t think it\u2019s comparable because she didn\u2019t win a special\
  \ award like he did and wasn\u2019t even really challenged, but am I being an asshole?\n\
  \nEdit: I do not favor my son over my daughter. If he had won an easy match and\
  \ she had lost to an instructor, I would have made sure to celebrate her in the\
  \ same way I celebrated my son. I\u2019m a woman and a feminist so it\u2019s not\
  \ a gender thing either.\n\nI think a lot of people are missing the part where I\
  \ did congratulate my daughter. I told her I was proud of her, and I went on to\
  \ say that I had confidence the whole time that she had it in the bag because she\
  \ has won harder matches before.\n\nLastly, someone accused my son of being a poor\
  \ loser. I assure you this was not the case. He was gracious in the moment and shook\
  \ the instructor\u2019s hand, but later when he thought no one was looking I could\
  \ see he was about to cry."
title: AITA for celebrating my son losing his TaeKwonDo match but not my daughter
  winning hers?
