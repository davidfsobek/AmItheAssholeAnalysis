selftext: "Okay, to establish this, my ex and I have been divorced for a year now\
  \ and separated for almost 3.  It was a VERY bitter divorce and despite an attempt\
  \ or two at building a better post-divorce relationship wholly initiated by me,\
  \ we rarely speak to each other even by text.\n\nWe have boy/girl twins and today\
  \ was their 18th birthday.  Earlier in the week she texted me insinuating the squirts\
  \ wanted us all to go out to dinner that night and I said I would let her know.\
  \  I later found out it was her idea and she had approached them with it.  I wouldn't\
  \ be surprised to find out she was doing this just to manipulate things so she got\
  \ them almost the whole day on their 18th birthday. \n\nI agreed and was not given\
  \ any input to the time or place, but still went along with it.  It ended up being\
  \ a pricey place at about $35 per plate plus extras.  I arrived before everyone\
  \ else, ordered an appetizer and a drink and waited.  All throughout the dinner,\
  \ the ex did not even acknowledge my presence, even though it was her idea.  Not\
  \ so much as a glance in my direction.  I got along with the squirts and two friends\
  \ of theirs that came, gave them presents, and we all had a great time except she\
  \ rarely spoke at all to anyone.\n\nWhen we ordered, I told the waitress I would\
  \ be paying for mine and we went on with the meal.  Both squirts suggested I pay\
  \ more but my feeling was, she invited me and lied about it, then gave me no input\
  \ into when and where, then proceeded to ignore me for the entire meal. I paid my\
  \ share and left a bit early to make sure she got some alone time with the group.\n\
  \nSo, AITA for not offering to pay more?  With the tip my meal came out to $60,\
  \ so she probably spent $200 on the rest. \n\nEdit:  It was suggested I add that\
  \ I did bring gifts by way of a PS4 and a trip to Chicago.  I didn't think that\
  \ had bearing.  I did that for them not because of her.  I think too many people\
  \ are assuming we had some kind of knock down drag out fight.  We didn't even speak...\n\
  \nEdit:  Let me ask you this.  Much is being said about it being stressful and unfair\
  \ to the kids to bring our baggage into it.  I want to make it perfectly clear that\
  \ everyone had a great time together except for the ex, who I can't tell because\
  \ she didn't say ANYTHING.  Laughs and joking abounded.  Much was made of the fact\
  \ that my son looked like Captain Crunch.  We DID have fun and there was no arguing.\
  \ She didn't speak up about the bill and didn't even look askance when I said that.\
  \  What if it is the opposite of what a lot of people are saying and she was perfectly\
  \ fine with it?  I honestly do not know.  I would think if I were throwing my kids\
  \ a party and someone else tried to take that away from me then I would be upset.\
  \  She did get them small gifts, so the dinner might have been her big thing."
