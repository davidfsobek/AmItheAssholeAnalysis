selftext: "My sister-in-law has two kids (son and daughter) who are 4 and 6 and she\
  \ LOVES to take pictures of them and share the photos with everyone. She also loves\
  \ to throw large birthday parties for her kids, and she\u2019ll get upset if you\
  \ don\u2019t make it, because she feels that these are very important family functions.\
  \ Ok fine.\n\nEvery year for each of their birthdays, she\u2019ll put together a\
  \ slide show of photos with music that usually runs about 20 minutes long. She invites\
  \ the entire family over for their birthday celebrations, and after everyone arrives\
  \ she has everyone sit down in front of the tv, and watch a slideshow that consists\
  \ of only pictures of either son or daughter (depending on whose birthday it is\
  \ of course.) Each year they have usually ran around 15-20 minutes, but last year\
  \ each slideshow was almost 30 minutes long. Most of the family has gotten visibly\
  \ and vocally irritated at this point; I.e. rolling their eyes when she announces\
  \ the slideshow is going to start, taking bets for how long they think it will be,\
  \ making \u201Cshoot me now\u201D gestures, or just simply saying \u201Coh for fuck\
  \ sake this again?\u201D And etc. Last year a couple family members just got up\
  \ and left after she announced the slideshow. Sister-in-law seems to be either completely\
  \ oblivious to how others feel or is just completely inconsiderate. I would like\
  \ to think that she\u2019s not the latter, but I feel like she needs to know that\
  \ almost no one enjoys/wants to watch 30 minute videos of her children. \n\nI feel\
  \ like if I\u2019m the only one that suggests shorter slideshows, or if I seem to\
  \ be the only one that is irritated by them, then she\u2019s not going to consider\
  \ changing them.\n\nWIBTA if I told her that no one wants to watch 30 minute slideshows\
  \ of her children?"
